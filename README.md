 T2: For all PMIDs in each row of a table save the according abstracts in additional columns.

 T3: Textmining of abstracts/text of each row. Extraction of most frequent words. Generation of binary matrix (rows= entities, columns= words).
 
 T4: PubTator search for specific scientific words from PMIDs. Generation of binary matrix (rows= entities, columns= words).
