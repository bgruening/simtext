"CHD2"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a surgical treatment available for patients affected by generalized refractory epilepsy. The authors report the case of a 15-year-old girl affected by CHD2-related myoclonic encephalopathy and BLM haploinsufficiency due to a deletion of 15q25.3q26.2 region, who suffered from secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH) after a VNS wound infection. SHLH has sporadically been described in epileptic patients. Based on indirect evidence that shows immune dysregulation in patients with CHD2 mutations and BLM mutations, we hypothesize that the genetic background of this patient may have played a critical role in the development of the syndrome."	"Thymic epithelial tumors (TET) including thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare, but they are common primary tumors in the anterior mediastinum. The etiology and tumorigenesis of TET remain unclear. To better understand the novel aberrations of this rare tumor and provide more significant mutation sites for targeted therapy, we performed next-generation sequencing detection on 55 patients with TET. Our results showed that most genes in 12 core pathways harbored aberrations of indeterminate potential. In 4 genes (ARID1A, KMT2C, TGFBR2 and MAP3K1), the indel frequency was above 90%. Dozens of genes, including TGFBR2, KMT2C, PRKDC, ATR, CHD2, SDHA, KDM5A, CHEK1, MSH6 and POLE, possessed frameshift indel with different frequencies in different hotspot sites, which could be the new targets of therapy for TET. For the first time, we revealed a strong correlation between the tumor mutational burden and single nucleotide variations, but not frameshift, on DNA mismatch repair gene MSH6 in TET."	"This paper reports the electroclinical manifestations of an epilepsy syndrome associated with a chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2) gene mutation with clinical semiology and electroencephalographic (EEG) features consistent with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Myoclonic and myoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures, as well as generalized 4- to 5-Hz high-amplitude spike-wave and polyspike-wave discharges, were well characterized in an adolescent. However, the atypical age of onset, developmental disability, and apparent drug resistance led to suspicion of an alternative etiology for epilepsy, subsequently verified as a CHD2 gene mutation. When atypical features are present, a JME mimic should be suspected in the differential diagnosis of the more established syndrome of JME."	"The role of deleterious copy number variations in schizophrenia is well established while data regarding pathogenic variations remain scarce. We report for the first time a case of schizophrenia in a child with a pathogenic mutation of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) gene.The proband was the second child of unrelated parents. Anxiety and sleep disorders appeared at the age of 10 months. He presented febrile seizures and, at the age of 8, two generalized tonic-clonic seizures. At the age of 10, emotional withdrawal emerged, along with a flat affect, disorganization and paranoid ideation, without seizures. He began to talk and giggle with self. Eventually, the patient presented daily auditory and visual hallucinations. The diagnosis of childhood onset schizophrenia (DSM V) was then evoked. Brain imaging was unremarkable. Wakefulness electroencephalography showed a normal background and some bilateral spike-wave discharges that did not explain the psychosis features. A comparative genomic hybridization array (180 K, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) revealed an 867-kb 16p13.3 duplication, interpreted as a variant of unknown significance confirmed by a quantitative PCR that also showed its maternal inheritance. Risperidone (1,5 mg per day), led to clinical improvement. At the age of 11, an explosive relapse of epilepsy occurred with daily seizures of various types. The sequencing of a panel for monogenic epileptic disorders and Sanger sequencing revealed a de novo pathogenic heterozygous transition in CHD2 (NM_001271.3: c.4003G &gt; T).This case underlines that schizophrenia may be, sometimes, underpinned by a Mendelian disease. It addresses the question of systematic genetic investigations in the presence of warning signs such as a childhood onset of the schizophrenia or a resistant epilepsy. It points that, in the absence of pathogenic copy number variation, the investigations should also include a search for pathogenic variations, which means that some of the patients with schizophrenia should benefit from Next Generation Sequencing tools. Last but not least, CHD2 encodes a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family involved in chromatin remodeling. This observation adds schizophrenia to the phenotypic spectrum of chromodomain remodeling disorders, which may lead to innovative therapeutic approaches."	"Dravet syndrome is the most studied form of genetic epilepsy. It has now been clarified that the clinical spectrum of the syndrome does not have firmly established boundaries. The core phenotype is characterized by intractable, mainly clonic, seizures precipitated by increased body temperature with onset in the first year of life and subsequent appearance of multiple seizures types still precipitated by, but not confined to, hyperthermia. Cognitive impairment is invariably present when the full syndrome is manifested. This complex of symptoms is related to mutations in the SCN1A gene, which are often de novo and constitutional but can also be inherited from a parent with less severe clinical manifestations or be present as somatic mosaicism. Inheritance from less severely affected individuals, at times only having experienced a few febrile seizures, and differences in severity, even within the same family, with a subset of patients only showing fragments of the syndrome, testify to a remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity as far as severity, but less so clinical phenomenology, are concerned. This characteristic, together with underascertainment of SCN1A mutations due to human errors or technical limitations in uncovering alternative pathogenic molecular mechanisms, such as genomic rearrangements or poison exons, has contributed to making clinicians and geneticists suspicious that Dravet syndrome may be caused by more than one gene. This opinion has been further amplified by the description of other genetic disorders, such as PCDH19- or CHD2-related epilepsy, whose phenotypes have included fragments of the Dravet phenotypic spectrum, and by the suboptimal characterization of phenotypes associated with mutations in SCN1B, HCN1, KCN2A, GABRA1, GABRG2, and STXBP1. The SCN1A gene-Dravet syndrome association is in our opinion highly specific. However, because the syndrome spectrum is wide, fragments of it can at times also be manifested in other genetic epilepsy syndromes, thereby leading to overdiagnosis of Dravet syndrome beyond SCN1A. Dravet syndrome is in turn a severe SCN1A phenotype within a continuum of SCN1A-related clinical phenomenology."	"The transcriptional program that dictates haematopoietic cell fate and differentiation requires an epigenetic regulatory and memory function, provided by a network of epigenetic factors that regulate DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications and chromatin structure. Disturbed epigenetic regulation causes perturbations in the blood cell differentiation program that results in various types of haematopoietic disorders. Thus, accurate epigenetic regulation is essential for functional haematopoiesis. In this study, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach to identify new epigenetic regulators in myeloid differentiation. We designed a Chromatin-UMI CRISPR guide library targeting 1092 epigenetic regulators. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of the chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line K-562 was used as a megakaryocytic myeloid differentiation model. Both previously described developmental epigenetic regulators and novel factors were identified in our screen. In this study, we validated and characterized a role for the chromatin remodeller CHD2 in myeloid proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation."	"Single-minded homologue 1 (SIM1) is a transcription factor with several physiological and developmental functions. Haploinsufficiency of SIM1 is associated with early-onset obesity with or without Prader-Willi-like (PWL) features and may exhibit incomplete penetrance.Next-generation sequencing was performed for 2 male patients with obesity, including 1 man presenting with intellectual disability (ID), body mass index (BMI) of 47.4, and impulse-control disorder, and the other man with early obesity (BMI of 36); sequencing revealed a missense variant in SIM1 (c.2144G&gt;T; p.G715V) in both individuals. Previous studies have identified several disease-associated variants that fall near the p.G715V variant within the C-terminal domain of SIM1. We examined p.G715V variant stability and activity in a doxycycline-inducible stable cell line transfected with an artificial reporter construct and either ARNT or ARNT2 as a partner protein.Functional testing of the p.G715V variant revealed a significant reduction in SIM1-mediated transcriptional activity. We also generated the first ab initio hybrid protein model for full-length SIM1 to show the predicted spatial relationship between p.G715V and other previously described variants in this region and identified a putative mutation hotspot within the C-terminus. Significant clinical heterogeneity has been observed in patients with SIM1 variants, particularly with regards to the PWL phenotype. In the patient with ID, a second variant of uncertain significance in CHD2 was identified that may contribute to his ID and behavioral disturbances, emphasizing the role of additional genetic modifiers."	"Short stature is one of the most common reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist and can result from many etiologies. However, many patients with short stature do not receive a definitive diagnosis.To ascertain whether integrating targeted bioinformatics searches of electronic health records (EHRs) combined with genomic studies could identify patients with previously undiagnosed rare genetic etiologies of short stature. We focused on a specific rare phenotypic subgroup: patients with short stature and elevated IGF-I levels.We performed a cross-sectional cohort study at three large academic pediatric healthcare networks. Eligible subjects included children with heights below -2 SD, IGF-I levels &gt;90th percentile, and no known etiology for short stature. We performed a search of the EHRs to identify eligible patients. Patients were then recruited for phenotyping followed by exome sequencing and in vitro assays of IGF1R function.A total of 234 patients were identified by the bioinformatics algorithm with 39 deemed eligible after manual review (17%). Of those, 9 were successfully recruited. A genetic etiology was identified in 3 of the 9 patients including 2 novel variants in IGF1R and a de novo variant in CHD2. In vitro studies supported the pathogenicity of the IGF1R variants.This study provides proof of principle that patients with rare phenotypic subgroups can be identified based on discrete data elements in the EHRs. Although limitations exist to fully automating this approach, these searches may help find patients with previously unidentified rare genetic disorders."	"The oncogenic events involved in breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) remain elusive. To clarify this point, we have characterized the genomic landscape of 34 BI-ALCLs (15 tumor and 19 in situ subtypes) collected from 54 BI-ALCL patients diagnosed through the French Lymphopath network. Whole-exome sequencing (n = 22, with paired tumor/germline DNA) and/or targeted deep sequencing (n = 24) showed recurrent mutations of epigenetic modifiers in 74% of cases, involving notably KMT2C (26%), KMT2D (9%), CHD2 (15%), and CREBBP (15%). KMT2D and KMT2C mutations correlated with a loss of H3K4 mono- and trimethylation by immunohistochemistry. Twenty cases (59%) showed mutations in ≥1 member of the JAK/STAT pathway, including STAT3 (38%), JAK1 (18%), and STAT5B (3%), and in negative regulators, including SOCS3 (6%), SOCS1 (3%), and PTPN1 (3%). These mutations were more frequent in tumor-type samples than in situ samples (P = .038). All BI-ALCLs expressed pSTAT3, regardless of the mutational status of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway. Mutations in the EOMES gene (12%) involved in lymphocyte development, PI3K-AKT/mTOR (6%), and loss-of-function mutations in TP53 (12%) were also identified. Copy-number aberration (CNA) analysis identified recurrent alterations, including gains on chromosomes 2, 9p, 12p, and 21 and losses on 4q, 8p, 15, 16, and 20. Regions of CNA encompassed genes involved in the JAK/STAT pathway and epigenetic regulators. Our results show that the BI-ALCL genomic landscape is characterized by not only JAK/STAT activating mutations but also loss-of-function alterations of epigenetic modifiers."	"Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (Chd2) is a chromatin remodeller implicated in neurological disease. Here we show that Chaserr, a highly conserved long noncoding RNA transcribed from a region near the transcription start site of Chd2 and on the same strand, acts in concert with the CHD2 protein to maintain proper Chd2 expression levels. Loss of Chaserr in mice leads to early postnatal lethality in homozygous mice, and severe growth retardation in heterozygotes. Mechanistically, loss of Chaserr leads to substantially increased Chd2 mRNA and protein levels, which in turn lead to transcriptional interference by inhibiting promoters found downstream of highly expressed genes. We further show that Chaserr production represses Chd2 expression solely in cis, and that the phenotypic consequences of Chaserr loss are rescued when Chd2 is perturbed as well. Targeting Chaserr is thus a potential strategy for increasing CHD2 levels in haploinsufficient individuals."	"Optimized NMR experiments are developed for isolating magnetization belonging to the I=1/2 manifolds of <sup>13</sup> CH<sub>3</sub> methyl groups in proteins, enabling the manipulation of the magnetization of a <sup>13</sup> CH<sub>3</sub> moiety as if it were an AX (<sup>1</sup> H-<sup>13</sup> C) spin-system. These experiments result in the same 'simplification' of a <sup>13</sup> CH<sub>3</sub> spin-system that would be obtained from the production of {<sup>13</sup> CHD<sub>2</sub> }-methyl-labeled protein samples. The sensitivity of I=1/2 manifold-selection experiments is a factor of approximately 2 less than that of the corresponding experiments acquired on {<sup>13</sup> CHD<sub>2</sub> }-labeled methyl groups. The methodology described here is primarily intended for small-to-medium sized proteins, where the losses in sensitivity associated with the isolation of I=1/2 manifold transitions can be tolerated. Several NMR applications that benefit from simplification of the <sup>13</sup> CH<sub>3</sub> (AX<sub>3</sub> ) spin-systems are described, with an emphasis on the measurements of methyl <sup>1</sup> H-<sup>13</sup> C residual dipolar couplings in a {<sup>13</sup> CH<sub>3</sub> }-methyl-labeled deletion mutant of the human chaperone DNAJB6b, where modulation of NMR signal intensities due to evolution of methyl <sup>1</sup> H-<sup>13</sup> C scalar and dipolar couplings follows a simple cosine function characteristic of an AX (<sup>1</sup> H-<sup>13</sup> C) spin-system, significantly simplifying data analysis."	"The aim of this report was to refine the genotypes and phenotypes of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2)-related epilepsy. Seventeen patients with CHD2 mutations were enrolled. CHD2 mutations were identified by application of next-generation sequencing of epilepsy or whole exome sequencing. Sixteen mutations were identified, among which 15 have not yet been reported. Thirteen mutations were de novo. Age at seizure onset ranged from 3 months to 10 years 5 months. Seizures observed were generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, atonic, atypical absence, focal, and myoclonic-atonic. Epileptic spasms occurred in two patients. Developmental disability was present in 14 patients. Autism features were observed in seven patients. Video electroencephalogram was abnormal in 15 patients. Five patients were diagnosed with non-specific epileptic encephalopathy, two with epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, two with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, two with febrile seizures plus, and one with West syndrome. Seizures were controlled in nine patients. Q1392TfsX17 may be a hot-spot mutation of CHD2. West syndrome was observed as a new phenotype of CHD2 mutation. The severity of the phenotypes of CHD2 mutations ranged from mild febrile seizures to severe epileptic encephalopathy. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Q1392TfsX17 maybe the hot-spot mutation of CHD2. West syndrome could be a new phenotype of CHD2 mutation."	"In this paper, we present rovibrational energy levels of CH<sub>2</sub>D<sup>+</sup> and CHD<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>. They are computed with a large basis and the Lanczos algorithm. CH<sub>2</sub>D<sup>+</sup> and CHD<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> are believed to play an important role in interstellar space, but so far, there are no definitive observations. The predictions of this paper should facilitate detection. For CH<sub>2</sub>D<sup>+</sup>, two CH stretch bands have been studied at high resolution. Compared to our calculated energies, the root-mean-square error is 0.08 cm<sup>-1</sup>. For CHD<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, one CH stretch band has been studied at high resolution. Compared to our calculated energies, the root-mean-square error is 0.5 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Errors are larger, for both isotopologues, for bend states. We attribute these errors to the potential energy surface. Wave function and probability distribution plots are used to make assignments. The ν<sub>1</sub> band of CHD<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is significantly perturbed, and according to our calculations, the 3ν<sub>3</sub> state is closest and might be the most important perturber."	"Post-translational methylation of lysine side chains is of great importance for protein regulation, including epigenetic control. Here, we present specific <sup>13</sup>CHD<sub>2</sub> labeling of dimethylated lysines as a sensitive probe of the structure, interactions, and dynamics of these groups, and outline a theoretical and experimental framework for analyzing their conformational dynamics using <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments. Dimethylated lysine side chains in calcium-loaded calmodulin show a marked pH dependence of their Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dispersion profiles, indicating complex exchange behavior. Combined analysis of <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C CPMG relaxation dispersions requires consideration of 12-state correlated exchange of the two methyl groups due to circular three-state rotamer jumps around the Cε-Nζ axis combined with proton exchange and amine inversion. Taking into account a number of fundamental constraints, the exchange model can be reduced to include only three fitted parameters, namely, the geometric average of the rotamer-jump rate constants, the rate constant of deprotonation of Nζ, and the chemical shift difference between the trans and gauge positions of the <sup>13</sup>C or <sup>1</sup>H nuclei. The pH dependence indicates that protonation of the end group dramatically slows down rotamer exchange for some lysine residues, whereas deprotonation leads to rapid amine inversion coupled with rotamer scrambling. The observed variation among residues in their exchange behavior appears to depend on the structural environment of the side chain. Understanding this type of exchange process is critical to correctly interpreting NMR spectra of methylated lysine side chains. The exchange model presented here forms the basis for studying the structure and dynamics of epigenetically modified lysine side chains and perturbations caused by changes in pH or interactions with target proteins."	"This study aims to elucidate the regulatory effect of circular RNA UBAP2 (circUBAP2) on the progression of ovarian cancer (OC).Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expressions of circUBAP2, microRNA-144 and CHD2 in OC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The correlation between the expression levels of circUBAP2 and microRNA-144 with pathological parameters of OC patients was analyzed. Subcellular distribution of circUBAP2 was detected by chromatin fractionation assay. After overexpression of circUBAP2 in OC cells, changes in proliferative and migratory abilities were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assay, respectively. In addition, the Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to verify the binding of circUBAP2 and microRNA-144, and the binding of CHD2 to microRNA-144.QRT-PCR results showed that circUBAP2 was highly expressed in OC tissues, and its expression was negatively correlated with TMN stage and five-year survival of OC patients. CircUBAP2 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of circUBAP2 significantly promoted the proliferative and migratory abilities of OC cells. The Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that circUBAP2 could bind to microRNA-144. Meanwhile, circUBAP2 negatively regulated microRNA-144 expression in OC cells. Besides, the promotive effects of circUBAP2 on the proliferation and migration of OC cells were reversed by microRNA-144 overexpression. MicroRNA-144 was lowly expressed in OC tissues, which was negatively correlated with TNM stage of OC patients. The Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the binding condition between CHD2 and microRNA-144. CHD2 expression was negatively regulated by microRNA-144 in OC cells. Moreover, CHD2 could bind to microRNA-144 and partially inhibited its activity, thereby promoting the proliferative and migratory abilities of OC cells.CircUBAP2 promotes the progression of ovarian cancer by adsorbing microRNA-144."	"B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) is a rare hematological disorder whose underlying oncogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Our cytogenetic and molecular assessments of 34 patients with B-PLL revealed several disease-specific features and potential therapeutic targets. The karyotype was complex (≥3 abnormalities) in 73% of the patients and highly complex (≥5 abnormalities) in 45%. The most frequent chromosomal aberrations were translocations involving MYC [t(MYC)] (62%), deletion (del)17p (38%), trisomy (tri)18 (30%), del13q (29%), tri3 (24%), tri12 (24%), and del8p (23%). Twenty-six (76%) of the 34 patients exhibited an MYC aberration, resulting from mutually exclusive translocations or gains. Whole-exome sequencing revealed frequent mutations in TP53, MYD88, BCOR, MYC, SF3B1, SETD2, CHD2, CXCR4, and BCLAF1. The majority of B-PLL used the IGHV3 or IGHV4 subgroups (89%) and displayed significantly mutated IGHV genes (79%). We identified 3 distinct cytogenetic risk groups: low risk (no MYC aberration), intermediate risk (MYC aberration but no del17p), and high risk (MYC aberration and del17p) (P = .0006). In vitro drug response profiling revealed that the combination of a B-cell receptor or BCL2 inhibitor with OTX015 (a bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor targeting MYC) was associated with significantly lower viability of B-PLL cells harboring a t(MYC). We concluded that cytogenetic analysis is a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool in B-PLL. Targeting MYC may be a useful treatment option in this disease."	"Sensitivity and resolution together determine the quality of NMR spectra in biological solids. For high-resolution structure determination with solid-state NMR, proton-detection emerged as an attractive strategy in the last few years. Recent progress in probe technology has extended the range of available MAS frequencies up to above 100 kHz, enabling the detection of resolved resonances from sidechain protons, which are important reporters of structure. Here we characterise the interplay between MAS frequency in the newly available range of 70-110 kHz and proton content on the spectral quality obtainable on a 1 GHz spectrometer for methyl resonances. Variable degrees of proton densities are tested on microcrystalline samples of the α-spectrin SH3 domain with selectively protonated methyl isotopomers (CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>D, CHD<sub>2</sub>) in a perdeuterated matrix. The experimental results are supported by simulations that allow the prediction of the sensitivity outside this experimental frequency window. Our results facilitate the selection of the appropriate labelling scheme at a given MAS rotation frequency."	"Fine-mapping of regions linked to the inheritance of hypertension is accomplished by genetic dissection of blood pressure quantitative trait loci (BP QTLs) in rats. The goal of the current study was to further fine-map two genomic regions on rat chromosome 1 with opposing blood pressure effects (BP QTL1b1 and BP QTL1b1a), the homologous region of which on human chromosome 15 harbors BP QTLs. Two new substrains were constructed and studied from the previously reported BP QTL1b1, one having significantly lower systolic BP by 17 mmHg than that of the salt-sensitive (S) rat (P = 0.007). The new limits of BP QTL1b1 were between 134.09 Mb and 135.40 Mb with a 43% improvement from the previous 2.31 Mb to the current 1.31 Mb interval containing 4 protein-coding genes (Rgma, Chd2, Fam174b, and St8sia2), 2 predicted miRNAs, and 4 lncRNAs. One new substrain was constructed and studied from the previously reported BPQTL1b1a having a significantly higher systolic BP by 22 mmHg (P = 0.006) than that of the S rat. The new limits of BPQTL1b1a were between 133.53 Mb and 134.52 Mb with a 32% improvement from the previous1.45 Mb to the current 990.21 Kb interval containing 1 protein-coding gene, Mctp2, and a lncRNA. The congenic segments of these two BP QTLs overlapped between 134.09 Mb and 134.52 Mb. No exonic variants were detected in any of the genes. These findings reiterate complexity of genetic regulation of BP within QTL regions, where elements beyond protein-coding sequences could be factors in controlling BP."	"We evaluated the accuracy of the <i>J</i>-shifting approximation to estimate reactant state-selected cross sections for the F+CH<sub>4</sub> → HF+CH<sub>3</sub> and F+CHD<sub>3</sub> → HF+CD<sub>3</sub>/DF+CHD<sub>2</sub> reactions. In particular, we analyzed how the rotational state of methane influences the quality of the approximation. The systems were considered in full dimensionality. Since full-quantum scattering calculations are still unfeasible for these reactions, we employed quasi-classical trajectories (QCT) to calculate the cross sections. The characteristics of the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface of these reactions pose a great challenge to the assumptions of the <i>J</i>-shifting approach. In spite of this, we found that it performs well for both reactions if the methane molecule is in the rotational ground state. However, when methane is rotationally excited, the approach affords good results for the F+CH<sub>4</sub> system but clearly fails for F+CHD<sub>3</sub>. The reasons for this failure will be discussed, and a simple procedure to recover good estimators for the cross sections from <i>J</i> = 0 calculations will be introduced."	NA
"EEF1A2"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>) is widely used to induce a cellular model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in dopaminergic cell lines. Downregulation of the protein translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) has been reported in the brain tissue of PD patients. eEF1A2, an isoform of eEF1A, is associated with lysosome biogenesis that involves the autophagy process. However, the role of eEF1A2 on autophagic activity in PD has not been elucidated. In this work, we investigated the role of eEF1A2 on autophagy using eEF1A2 siRNA knockdown in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells treated with MPP<sup>+</sup>. We found that eEF1A2 was upregulated in differentiated cells, which could be silenced by eEF1A2 siRNA. Significantly, cells treated with MPP<sup>+</sup> after eEF1A2 knockdown showed a decreased number of LC3 puncta, decreased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, and decreased phospho-Beclin-1, compared to the MPP<sup>+</sup> alone group. These cells showed extensive areas of mitochondria damage, with a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, but reduced mitophagy as indicated by the reduced colocalization of LC3 puncta with damaged mitochondria. Cells with eEF1A2 siRNA plus MPP<sup>+</sup> treatment aggravated α-synuclein accumulation but reduced colocalization with LC3. As a result, eEF1A2 knockdown decreased viability, increased apoptotic nuclei, increased caspase-3/7 activation and increased cleaved caspase-3 when cells were treated with MPP<sup>+</sup>. These results suggest that eEF1A2 is essential for dopaminergic neuron survival against MPP<sup>+</sup>, in part through autophagy regulation."	"Heterozygous de novo variants in the eukaryotic elongation factor EEF1A2 have previously been described in association with intellectual disability and epilepsy but never functionally validated. Here we report 14 new individuals with heterozygous EEF1A2 variants. We functionally validate multiple variants as protein-damaging using heterologous expression and complementation analysis. Our findings allow us to confirm multiple variants as pathogenic and broaden the phenotypic spectrum to include dystonia/choreoathetosis, and in some cases a degenerative course with cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Pathogenic variants appear to act via a haploinsufficiency mechanism, disrupting both the protein synthesis and integrated stress response functions of EEF1A2. Our studies provide evidence that EEF1A2 is highly intolerant to variation and that de novo pathogenic variants lead to an epileptic-dyskinetic encephalopathy with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features. Developmental features may be driven by impaired synaptic protein synthesis during early brain development while progressive symptoms may be linked to an impaired ability to handle cytotoxic stressors."	"The budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> has an actin cytoskeleton that comprises a set of protein components analogous to those found in the actin cytoskeletons of higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, the actin cytoskeletons of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and of higher eukaryotes have some similar physiological roles. The genetic tractability of budding yeast and the availability of a stable haploid cell type facilitates the application of molecular genetic approaches to assign functions to the various actin cytoskeleton components. This has provided information that is in general complementary to that provided by studies of the equivalent proteins of higher eukaryotes and hence has enabled a more complete view of the role of these proteins. Several human functional homologues of yeast actin effectors are implicated in diseases. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the functions of these proteins is critical to develop improved therapeutic strategies. In this article we chose as examples four evolutionarily conserved proteins that associate with the actin cytoskeleton: 1) yeast Hof1p/mammalian PSTPIP1, 2) yeast Rvs167p/mammalian BIN1, 3) yeast eEF1A/eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 and 4) yeast Yih1p/mammalian IMPACT. We compare the knowledge on the functions of these actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins that has arisen from studies of their homologues in yeast with information that has been obtained from in vivo studies using live animals or in vitro studies using cultured animal cell lines."	"Heterozygous de novo mutations in EEF1A2, encoding the tissue-specific translation elongation factor eEF1A2, have been shown to cause neurodevelopmental disorders including often severe epilepsy and intellectual disability. The mutational profile is unusual; ~ 50 different missense mutations have been identified but no obvious loss of function mutations, though large heterozygous deletions are known to be compatible with life. A key question is whether the heterozygous missense mutations operate through haploinsufficiency or a gain of function mechanism, an important prerequisite for design of therapeutic strategies. In order both to address this question and to provide a novel model for neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from mutations in EEF1A2, we created a new mouse model of the D252H mutation. This mutation causes the eEF1A2 protein to be expressed at lower levels in brain but higher in muscle in the mice. We compared both heterozygous and homozygous D252H and null mutant mice using behavioural and motor phenotyping alongside molecular modelling and analysis of binding partners. Although the proteomic analysis pointed to a loss of function for the D252H mutant protein, the D252H homozygous mice were more severely affected than null homozygotes on the same genetic background. Mice that are heterozygous for the missense mutation show no behavioural abnormalities but do have sex-specific deficits in body mass and motor function. The phenotyping of our novel mouse lines, together with analysis of molecular modelling and interacting proteins, suggest that the D252H mutation results in a gain of function."	"Ring chromosome 20 (r20) is characterized by intellectual impairment, behavioral disorders, and refractory epilepsy. We report a patient presenting nonmosaic ring chromosome 20 followed by duplication and deletion in 20q13.33 with seizures, delayed neuropsychomotor development and language, mild hypotonia, low weight gain, and cognitive deficit. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) enabled us to restrict a chromosomal segment and thus integrate clinical and molecular data with systems biology. With this approach, we were able to identify candidate genes that may help to explain the consequences of deletions in 20q13.33. In our analysis, we observed five hubs (ARFGAP1, HELZ2, COL9A3, PTK6, and EEF1A2), seven bottlenecks (CHRNA4, ARFRP1, GID8, COL9A3, PTK6, ZBTB46, and SRMS), and two H-B nodes (PTK6 and COL9A3). The candidate genes may play an important role in the developmental delay and seizures observed in r20 patients. Gene ontology included microtubule-based movement, nucleosome assembly, DNA repair, and cholinergic synaptic transmission. Defects in these bioprocesses are associated with the development of neurological diseases, intellectual disability, neuropathies, and seizures. Therefore, in this study, we can explore molecular cytogenetic data, identify proteins through network analysis of protein-protein interactions, and identify new candidate genes associated with the main clinical findings in patients with 20q13.33 deletions."	"EEF1A2 encodes protein elongation factor 1-alpha 2, which is involved in Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) to the A-site of ribosomes during protein biosynthesis and is highly expressed in the central nervous system. De novo mutations in EEF1A2 have been identified in patients with extensive neurological deficits, including intractable epilepsy, globe developmental delay, and severe intellectual disability. However, the mechanism underlying phenotype variation is unknown. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified a novel and a recurrent de novo mutation, c.294C&gt;A; p.(Phe98Leu) and c.208G&gt;A; p.(Gly70Ser), in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The further systematic analysis revealed that all EEF1A2 mutations were associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability, suggesting its critical role in neurodevelopment. Missense mutations with severe molecular alteration in the t-RNA binding sites or GTP hydrolysis domain were associated with early-onset severe epilepsy, indicating that the clinical expression was potentially determined by the location of mutations and alteration of molecular effects. This study highlights the potential genotype-phenotype relationship in EEF1A2 and facilitates the evaluation of the pathogenicity of EEF1A2 mutations in clinical practice."	"Glioblastomas are highly aggressive brain tumors with a very poor survival rate. EEF1A2, the proto-oncogenic isoform of the EEF1A translation factor family, has been found to be overexpressed and promoting tumorigenesis in multiple cancers. Interestingly, recent studies reported reduced expression of this protein in brain tumors, drawing our attention to find the functional role and mechanism of this protein in brain tumor progression.Using representative cell line as models, the role of EEF1A2 in cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed using MTS assay, scratch wound-healing assay, transwell migration and invasion assay, respectively. Activation of key signaling pathways was assessed using western blots and real-time PCR. Finally, using immunohistochemistry we checked the protein levels of EEF1A2 in CNS tumors.EEF1A2 was found to increase the proliferative, migratory and invasive properties of cell lines of both glial and neuronal origin. PI3K activation directly correlated with EEF1A2 levels. Protein levels of key EMT markers viz. Twist, Snail, and Slug were increased upon ectopic EEF1A2 expression. Furthermore, EEF1A2 was found to affect the expression levels of key inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteases. IHC analysis showed that EEF1A2 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissue.EEF1A2 acts as an oncogene in both neuronal and glial cells and triggers an EMT program via PI3K pathway. However, it shows enhanced expression in neuronal cells of the brain than the glial cells, which could explain the previously reported anomaly."	"All living beings on earth are influenced by the circadian rhythm, the rising and the setting of the sun. The ubiquitous effect of exercise is widely believed to maximize health benefits but has not been formally investigated for cardiac responses in the exercise-induced circadian rhythms. We hypothesized that the exercise-related proteome is differentially influenced by circadian rhythm and analyzed the differences between the effects of morning and evening exercise. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 per group): morning control, morning exercise, evening control, and evening exercise groups. The exercise groups were subjected to 12-week treadmill exercise (5 days/week) performed either during daytime or nighttime. After 12 weeks, the physiological characteristics (e.g., body weight, heart weight, visceral fat, and blood metabolites), cardiovascular capacity (ejection fraction (%) and fractional shortening (%)), circadian gene expression levels (clock, ball1, per1, per2, cry1, and cry2), and the proteomic data were obtained and subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis. The mRNA levels of per1 and cry2 increased in the evening group compared with those in the morning group. We also found that per2 decreased and cry2 increased in the evening exercise groups. The evening exercise groups showed more decreased triacylglycerides and increased blood insulin levels than the morning exercise group. The principal component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis indicated that the circadian rhythm differently influenced the protein networks of the exercise groups. In the morning exercise group, the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) (clock, per1, per2, cry1, and cry2) formed a protein-protein interaction network with Nme2, Hint1, Ddt, Ndufb8, Ldha, and Eef1a2. In contrast, the TTFL group appeared close to Maoa, Hist2h4, and Macrod1 in the evening exercise group. Interestingly, the evening exercise group decreased the mRNA level of per2 but not per1. Per1 and Per2 are known to transport Cry1 and Cry2 into the nucleus. Taken together, we summarized the characteristics of enriched proteins in the aspect of their molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. Our results might provide a better understanding of the circadian effect on exercise-related proteins."	"Eukaryotic Elongation Factor complex 1 (EEF1) consists of six subunits namely EEF1A1, EEF1A2, EEF1B2, EEF1D, EEF1E1 and EEF1G. Recently we showed that EEF1 complex proteins might play critical roles in cancer [1]. This article provides data on genes that share similar expression patterns with EEF1 complex proteins in cancer by analyzing RNA expression data using GEPIA online tool. Correlation analysis was performed on selected genes in a pairwise manner and the Pearson coefficients were automatically calculated by the GEPIA online tool. These data can be useful for future studies directed towards understanding the mechanisms by which EEF1 complex proteins affect in cancer pathogenesis."	"Zebrafish are valuable model organisms for the study of human single-gene disorders: they are genetically manipulable, their development is well understood, and mutant lines with measurable, disease-appropriate phenotypic abnormalities can be used for high throughput drug screening approaches. However, gene duplication events in zebrafish can result in redundancy of gene function, masking loss-of-function phenotypes and thus confounding this approach to disease modelling. Furthermore, recent studies have yielded contrasting results depending on whether specific genes are targeted using genome editing to make mutant lines, or whether morpholinos are used (morphants). De novo missense mutations in the human gene EEF1A2, encoding a tissue-specific translation elongation factor, cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders; there is a real need for a model system to study these disorders and we wanted to explore the possibility of a zebrafish model. We identified four eef1a genes and examined their developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns: eef1a1l1 is first to be expressed while eef1a2 is only detected later during development. We then determined the effects of introducing null mutations into translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, in order to compare the results with previously described morphants, and with severe neurodegenerative lethal phenotype of eEF1A2-null mice. In contrast with both earlier analyses in zebrafish using morpholinos and with the mouse eEF1A2-null mice, disruption of the eef1a2 gene in zebrafish is compatible with normal lifespan. The resulting lines, however, may provide a valuable platform for studying the effects of expression of mutant human eEF1A2 mRNA."	"Using whole exome sequencing, we found a pathogenic variant in the EEF1A2 gene in a patient with a Rett syndrome-like (RTT-like) phenotype, further confirming the association between EEF1A2 and Rett syndrome RTT and RTT-like phenotypes."	"Sorting nexin 16 (SNX16), a member of the sorting nexin family, has been implicated in tumor development. However, the function of SNX16 has not yet been investigated in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we showed that SNX16 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared with normal counterparts. Upregulated mRNA levels of SNX16 predicted poor survival of CRC patients. Functional experiments showed that SNX16 could promote CRC cells growth both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of SNX16 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, whereas ectopic overexpression of SNX16 had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, SNX16-eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) interaction could inhibit the degradation and ubiquitination of eEF1A2, followed by activation of downstream c-Myc signaling. Our study unveiled that the SNX16/eEF1A2/c-Myc signaling axis could promote colorectal tumorigenesis and SNX16 might potentially serve as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and an intervention of CRC."	"The effectiveness of therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in Western countries adults, can be improved via a deeper understanding of its molecular abnormalities. Whereas the isoforms of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A1 and eEF1A2) are implicated in different tumors, no information are available in CLL.eEF1A1/eEF1A2 amounts were quantitated in the lymphocytes of 46 CLL patients vs normal control (real time PCR, western blotting). eEF1A1 role in CLL was investigated in a cellular (MEC-1) and animal model of CLL via its targeting by an aptamer (GT75) or a siRNA (siA1) delivered by electroporation (in vitro) or lipofection (in vivo).eEF1A1/eEF1A2 were elevated in CLL lymphocytes vs control. eEF1A1 but not eEF1A2 levels were higher in patients which died during the study compared to those surviving. eEF1A1 targeting (GT75/siA1) resulted in MEC-1 viability reduction/autophagy stimulation and in vivo tumor growth down-regulation.The increase of eEF1A1 in dead vs surviving patients may confer to eEF1A1 the role of a prognostic marker for CLL and possibly of a therapeutic target, given its involvement in MEC-1 survival. Specific aptamer/siRNA released by optimized delivery systems may allow the development of novel therapeutic options."	"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218030.]."	"Plitidepsin (PLD, Aplidin®), a cyclic depsipeptide originally isolated from the marine tunicate Aplidium albicans, has been recently approved by Australian regulatory authorities for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients. Plitidepsin binds to eEF1A2 and induces oxidative stress, Rac1 activation and JNK1 phosphorylation, triggering a rapid apoptotic program in tumor cells. Since oxidative stress is one of the known sources of endoplasmic reticulum stress, we investigated whether PLD was inducing a bona fide ER stress in HeLa cells and whether this process was essential in the mechanism of action of the compound. Indeed, PLD activated an ER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), including the alternative splicing of XBP1, the proteolytic processing of ATF6 and the phosphorylation of eIF2α and JNK. Interestingly, though PLD induced a strong phosphorylation of eIF2α in all the analyzed cell lines, it did not elicit an increased expression of ATF4 and CHOP, a transcription factor involved in launching UPR-mediated apoptosis. On the contrary, a clear reduction of CHOP protein levels was observed after PLD treatment, most probably due to both the lack of transactivation by ATF4 and its rapid degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery. Using fibroblasts devoid of each one of the four possible kinases involved in eIF2α phosphorylation, we observed that only PKR was involved in the response to PLD treatment and, accordingly, PKR<sup>-/-</sup> fibroblasts are shown to be resistant to the apoptogenic activity of the compound. Furthermore, eIF2α phosphorylation itself was shown to be irrelevant for the induction of cell death by PLD. Instead, we reveal that PLD induces an increase in the levels of misfolded proteins while simultaneously inhibiting the autophagic flux. These two effects combined prevent PLD-treated cells from reducing proteotoxic stress and lead to apoptosis. Other anti-myeloma drugs like bortezomib, which target the proteasome, also inhibit the degradation of misfolded proteins through alternate pathways and a synergistic anticancer effect of the PLD plus bortezomib combination has been previously disclosed. The present results extend this synergy to in vivo experiments and provide a mechanistic rationale for this synergy."	"Autism is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a moderate to a high degree of heritability, but only a few common genetic variants that explain the heritability have been associated. We performed a genome-wide transmission disequilibrium test analysis of a newly genotyped autism case-parent triad samples (127 trios) in Han Chinese, identified top association signals at multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs9839376 (OR = 2.59, P = 1.27 × 10<sup>-05</sup> ) at KCNMB2, rs6044680 (OR = 0.319, P = 4.82 × 10<sup>-05</sup> ) and rs7274133 (OR = 0.313, P = 3.22 × 10<sup>-05</sup> ) at PCSK2, and rs310619 (OR = 2.40, P = 7.44 × 10<sup>-05</sup> ) at EEF1A2. Furthermore, a genome-wide combined P-value of individual SNPs in two independent case-parent triad samples (total 402 triads, n = 1,206) identified SNPs at EGFLAM, ZDHHC2, AGBL1, and SNX29 as additional association signals for autism. While none of these signals achieved a genome-wide significance in the two samples of our study, they have been reported in a previous genome-wide association study of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the majority of these SNP have a significant cis-regulatory association with mRNA in human tissues (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05). Our study warrants further study or replication with additional sample for association with autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Autism Res 2020, 13: 382-396. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Autism is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, heritable, but only a few common genetic variants that explain the heritability have been associated. We conducted a genome-wide association study with two cohorts of autism case-parent triad samples in Han Chinese and identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms that were reported as strong association signals in a previous genome-wide association study of other neuropsychiatric disorders or related traits. Our study provides evidence for shared genetic variants among autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders."	"In the cell, both transcriptional and translational processes are tightly regulated. Cancer is a multifactorial disease characterized by aberrant protein expression. Since epigenetic control mechanisms are also frequently disrupted during carcinogenesis, they have been the center of attention in cancer research within the past decades. EEF1 complex members, which are required for the elongation process in eukaryotes, have recently been implicated in carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate genetic alterations within EEF1A1, EEF1A2, EEF1B2, EEF1D, EEF1E1 and EEF1G genes and their potential effects on epigenetic regulation mechanisms.In this study, we analyzed DNA sequencing and mRNA expression data available on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across different cancer types to detect genetic alterations in EEF1 genes and investigated their potential impact on selected epigenetic modulators.We found that EEF1 complex proteins were deregulated in several types of cancer. Lower EEF1A1, EEF1B2, EEF1D and EEF1G levels were correlated with poor survival in glioma, while lower EEF1B2, EEF1D and EEF1E1 levels were correlated with better survival in hepatocellular carcinoma. We detected genetic alterations within EEF1 genes in up to 35% of the patients and showed that these alterations resulted in down-regulation of histone modifying enzymes KMT2C, KMT2D, KMT2E, KAT6A and EP300.Here in this study, we showed that EEF1 deregulations might result in differential epigenomic landscapes, which affect the overall transcriptional profile, contributing to carcinogenesis. Identification of these molecular distinctions might be useful in developing targeted drug therapies and personalized medicine."	"Recent studies raise the possibility that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) may play a role in metabolism. One isoform, eEF1A2, is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle, heart and brain. It regulates translation elongation and signal transduction. Nonetheless, eEF1A2's function in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism remains unclear. In the present study, suppression subtractive hybridisation showed a decrease in Eef1a2 transcripts in the skeletal muscle of diabetic Mongolian gerbils. This was confirmed at mRNA and protein levels in hyperglycaemic gerbils, and in db/db and high-fat diet-fed mice. Further, this downregulation was independent of Eef1a2 promoter methylation. Interestingly, adeno-associated virus-mediated eEF1A2 overexpression in skeletal muscle aggravated fasting hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and glucose intolerance in male diabetic gerbils but not in female gerbil models. The overexpression of eEF1A2 in skeletal muscle also resulted in promoted serum glucose levels and insulin resistance in male db/db mice. Up- and downregulation of eEF1A2 by lentiviral vector transfection confirmed its inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and signalling transduction in C2C12 myotubes with palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, eEF1A2 bound PKCβ and increased its activation in the cytoplasm, whereas suppression of PKCβ by an inhibitor attenuated eEF1A2-mediated impairment of insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant myotubes. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was elevated by eEF1A2, whereas suppression of ER stress or JNK partially restored insulin sensitivity in PA-treated myotubes. Additionally, eEF1A2 inhibited lipogenesis and lipid utilisation in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle. Collectively, we demonstrated that eEF1A2 exacerbates insulin resistance in male murine skeletal muscle via PKCβ and ER stress."	"Mutations in the elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (EEF1A2) gene have been recently shown to cause epileptic encephalopathy (MIM # 616409 EIEE33) associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder, hypotonia and dysmorphic facial features. EEF1A2 protein is involved in protein synthesis, suppression of apoptosis, regulation of actin function and cytoskeletal structure. To date, only sixteen patients with EEF1A2 mutations have been reported.We described a new case, a boy with severe intellectual disability with absent speech, autistic spectrum disorder, mild dysmorphic facial features, failure to thrive and epilepsy associated to a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in EEF1A2 (c.364G&gt;A; p.Glu122Lys) identified by next generation sequencing; it was already reported in other studies. Most clinical features are shared by all individuals with EEF1A2 mutation, but unlike others reports our patient showed a mild epileptic phenotype: epilepsy developed in late infancy and was well-controlled with antiepileptic drugs. Moreover, at the onset of epilepsy, interictal wake/sleep electroencephalograms showed typical pattern that disappeared with age.This report focused that EEF1A2 mutations should be considered not only in patients with epileptic encephalopathy, but also in those with less severe epilepsy. A typical EEG pattern may be a biomarker for EEF1A2 mutation, but further investigations and longitudinal clinical observations are required."	"The two isoforms of the eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1A (eEF1A1 and eEF1A2), sustain the progression/aggressiveness of cancer cells. Thus, they are considered promising therapeutic targets and prognostic markers. It follows that their precise quantification is of utmost relevance in research and development. The simultaneous quantification of A1 and A2 proteins in the cells helps the comprehension of cancer biology mechanisms and response to drug treatments. However, the high homology at the amino-acidic level (92%) can cause antibodies cross-reaction. Moreover, the commonly employed western blotting just gives semi-quantitative data and does not allow the detection of both protein targets within the same cell. Thus, we developed an in cell western (ICW) technique to bypass the above limitations.Firstly, relevant antibodies cross-reaction was excluded by immunohistochemistry on normal pancreatic tissue; then eEF1A1-A2 protein levels were quantitated by ICW in prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines in 96 well plates under different conditions, which include: 1) drug treatment, 2) siRNA silencing, 3) cell seeding density.We show that: 1) eEF1A1-A2 levels vary depending on the cell type following drug treatment, 2) ICW can accurately detect eEF1A1-A2 protein levels following siRNA silencing, 3) cell seeding density influences eEF1A1-A2 levels, depending on cell type.ICW is a valuable tool to specifically determine the intracellular level of eEF1A1-A2 proteins thus contributing to better define their role as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in human tumors as well as for drug effects screening."
"GRIN1"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"The release of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and related store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) regulate maturation of normal megakaryocytes. The <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) provides an additional mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in megakaryocytic cells, but its role remains unclear. We created a model of NMDAR hypofunction in Meg-01 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of the <i>GRIN1</i> gene, which encodes an obligate, GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR. We found that compared with unmodified Meg-01 cells, Meg-01-<i>GRIN1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells underwent atypical differentiation biased toward erythropoiesis, associated with increased basal ER stress and cell death. Resting cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were higher in Meg-01-<i>GRIN1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells, but ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and SOCE were lower after activation. Lysosome-related organelles accumulated including immature dense granules that may have contributed an alternative source of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Microarray analysis revealed that Meg-01-<i>GRIN1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells had deregulated expression of transcripts involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism, together with a shift in the pattern of hematopoietic transcription factors toward erythropoiesis. In keeping with the observed pro-cell death phenotype induced by <i>GRIN1</i> deletion, memantine (NMDAR inhibitor) increased cytotoxic effects of cytarabine in unmodified Meg-01 cells. In conclusion, NMDARs comprise an integral component of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory network in Meg-01 cells that help balance ER stress and megakaryocytic-erythroid differentiation. We also provide the first evidence that megakaryocytic NMDARs regulate biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, including dense granules. Our results argue that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis may be more important for normal megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation than currently recognized; thus, modulation may offer therapeutic opportunities."	"NMDARs are glutamate-gated ion channels that play critical roles in neuronal development and nervous system function. Here, we developed a model to study NMDARs in early development in zebrafish, by generating CRISPR-mediated lesions in the NMDAR genes, <i>grin1a</i> and <i>grin1b</i>, which encode the obligatory GluN1 subunits. While receptors containing <i>grin1a</i> or <i>grin1b</i> show high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, like their mammalian counterpart, <i>grin1a</i> is expressed earlier and more broadly in development than <i>grin1b</i> Both <i>grin1a</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>grin1b</i><sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish are viable. Unlike in rodents, where the <i>grin1</i> knockout is embryonic lethal, <i>grin1</i> double-mutant fish (<i>grin1a</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>; grin1b</i><sup>-/-</sup>), which lack all NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, survive until ∼10 d after fertilization, providing a unique opportunity to explore NMDAR function during development and in generating behaviors. Many behavioral defects in the <i>grin1</i> double-mutant larvae, including abnormal evoked responses to light and acoustic stimuli, prey-capture deficits, and a failure to habituate to acoustic stimuli, are replicated by short-term treatment with the NMDAR antagonist MK-801, suggesting that they arise from acute effects of compromised NMDAR-mediated transmission. Other defects, however, such as periods of hyperactivity and alterations in place preference, are not phenocopied by MK-801, suggesting a developmental origin. Together, we have developed a unique model to study NMDARs in the developing vertebrate nervous system. <b>Significance</b>Rapid communication between cells in the nervous system depends on ion channels that are directly activated by chemical neurotransmitters. One such ligand-gated ion channel, the NMDAR, impacts nearly all forms of nervous system function. It has been challenging, however, to study the prolonged absence of NMDARs in vertebrates, and hence their role in nervous system development, due to experimental limitations. Here, we demonstrate that zebrafish lacking all NMDAR transmission are viable through early development and are capable of a wide range of stereotypic behaviors. As such, this zebrafish model provides a unique opportunity to study the role of NMDAR in the development of the early vertebrate nervous system."	"Deficiency of activity-induced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF) disturbs neurotransmitter gene expression. Enriched environment treatment (EET) ameliorates the defects. However, how BDNF deficiency and EET affect neurotransmitter gene expression differently across ages remains unclear. We addressed this question by determining neurotransmitter gene expression across three life stages in wild-type and activity-dependent BDNF deficient (KIV) mice. Mice received 2-months of standard control treatment (SCT) or EET at early-life development (ED: 0-2 months), young adulthood (2-4 months), and old adulthood (12-14 months)(N=16/group). Half of these mice received additional one-month SCT to examine persisting EET effects. High-throughput qRT-PCR measured expression of 81 genes for dopamine, adrenaline, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and BDNF systems in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus. Results revealed that BDNF deficiency mostly reduced neurotransmitter gene expression, greatest at ED in the FC. EET increased expression of a larger number of genes at ED than adulthood, particularly in the KIV FC. Many genes downregulated in KIV mice were upregulated by EET, which persisted when EET was provided at ED (e.g., 5HTT, ADRA1D, GRIA3, GABRA5, GABBR2). In both regions, BDNF deficiency decreased the density of gene co-expression network specifically at ED, while EET increased the density and hub genes (e.g., GAT1, GABRG3, GRIN1, CHRNA7). These results suggest that BDNF deficiency, which occurs under chronic stress, causes neurotransmitter dysregulations prominently at ED, particularly in the FC. EET at ED may be most effective to normalize the dysregulations, providing persisting effects later in life."	"We investigated gonadal effects on hypothalamic transcription of genes in sham-operated and castrated redheaded buntings photostimulated into spring and autumn migratory states. RNA-Seq results showed testes-dependent differences between spring and autumn migratory states. In particular, differentially expressed genes enriched G-protein-coupled receptor and calcium-ion signaling pathways during spring and autumn states, respectively. qPCR assay showed attenuated gabra5, ttr, thra and thrb expressions, suggesting reduced GABA and thyroid hormone effects on photo-sexual response in spring. In spring castrates, reduced npy, tac1 and nrcam and increased ank3 expression suggested testicular effects on the appetite, prolactin release and neuronal functions, whereas in autumn castrates, reduced rasgrp1, grm5 and grin1, and increased mras expression suggested testicular effects on the ras, G-protein and glutamate signaling pathways. Castration-induced reciprocal switching of pomc and pdyn expressions suggested effects on the overall homeostasis in both seasons. These results demonstrate transcriptome-wide changes, with season-dependent roles of testes in songbird migration."	"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that contribute to nearly all brain processes. Not surprisingly then, genetic variations in the genes encoding NMDAR subunits can be associated with neurodevelopmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders. These disease-associated variants (DAVs) present challenges, such as defining how DAV-induced alterations in receptor function contribute to disease progression and how to treat the affected individual clinically. As a starting point to overcome these challenges, we need to refine our understanding of the complexity of NMDAR structure function. In this regard, DAVs have expanded our knowledge of NMDARs because they do not just target well-known structure-function motifs, but rather give an unbiased view of structural elements that are important to the biology of NMDARs. Indeed, established NMDAR structure-function motifs have been validated by the appearance of disorders in patients where these motifs have been altered, and DAVs have identified novel structural features in NMDARs such as gating triads and hinges in the gating machinery. Still, the majority of DAVs remain unexplored and occur at sites in the protein with unidentified function or alter receptor properties in multiple and unanticipated ways. Detailed mechanistic and structural investigations are required of both established and novel motifs to develop a highly refined pathomechanistic model that accounts for the complex machinery that regulates NMDARs. Such a model would provide a template for rational drug design and a starting point for personalized medicine."	"Excess body weight is the main risk factor of type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have shown that psychological and behavioral factors affect weight. Additionally, emerging evidence indicates that polymorphisms of neurotransmitter genes can impact eating behavior. The aim of this study was to detect the associations between SNPs in glutamatergic system genes and type 2 diabetes in the ethnic group of Tatars origin living in the Republic of Bashkortostan (Russian Federation). In our case-control cross-sectional study, 501 patients with type 2 diabetes (170 men and 331 women, 60.9 ± 9.2 years old (mean ± SD), BMI 30.9 ± 3.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean ± SD) of Tatar ethnicity, and a control group of 420 Tatars (170 men and 250 women, 56.3 ± 11.6 years old (mean ± SD), BMI 24.4 ± 4.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean ± SD), were genotyped for five SNPs in four glutamatergic genes (GRIN2B, GRIK3, GRIA1, GRIN1). Three SNPs were associated with type 2 diabetes: rs7301328 in GRIN2B [odds ratio adjusted for age, sex and BMI (OR<sup>adj</sup>) = 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.93), p<sup>adj</sup> = 0.0077], rs1805476 in GRIN2B [OR<sup>adj</sup> = 1.25 (95% CI 1.03-1.51), p<sup>adj</sup> = 0.0240], and rs2195450 in GRIA1 [OR<sup>adj</sup> = 1.35 (95% CI 1.02-1.79), p<sup>adj</sup> = 0.0340]. Regression analysis revealed that rs1805476 in GRIN2B was associated with LDL level, glomerular filtration rate, BMI (p = 0.020, p = 0.012 and p = 0.018, respectively). The SNP rs7301328 in GRIN2B was associated with triglyceride levels and HbA<sub>1c</sub> (p = 0.040, p = 0.023, respectively). These associations were not significant after Bonferroni correction. We found the association between rs534131 in GRIK3, rs2195450 in GRIA1, rs1805476 in GRIN2B and diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.005, p = 0.007, p = 0.040, respectively); rs7301328 in GRIN2B was associated with hypertension (p = 0.025) and cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.013). The association between rs534131 of GRIK3, rs2195450 of GRIA1 genes and diabetic retinopathy remained significant after Bonferroni correction. The SNPs rs6293 in GRIN1 was significantly associated with eating behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.01). Our results demonstrate that polymorphic variants of glutamatergic genes are associated with eating behavior and diabetic complications in Tatar ethnic group residing in the Republic of Bashkortostan. We detected novel associations of the polymorphic loci in GRIN1 (rs6293) gene with external eating behavior in type 2 diabetes patients, GRIK3 (rs534131) and GRIA1 (rs2195450) genes with diabetic retinopathy."	"Accumulating evidence suggests that kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which coexpress neurokinin B and dynorphin, are involved in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse generation, while the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) kisspeptin neurons are responsible for GnRH/LH surge generation. The present study aims to examine whether GnRH(1-5), a GnRH metabolite, regulates LH release via kisspeptin neurons. GnRH(1-5) was intracerebroventricularly injected to ovariectomized and estrogen-treated Wistar-Imamichi female rats. Immediately after the central GnRH(1-5) administration at 2 nmol, plasma LH concentration increased, resulting in significantly higher levels of the area under the curve and baseline of plasma LH concentrations compared to vehicle-injected controls. On the other hand, in Kiss1 knockout rats, GnRH(1-5) administration failed to affect LH secretion, suggesting that the facilitatory effect of GnRH(1-5) on LH release is mediated by kisspeptin neurons. Double in situ hybridization (ISH) for Kiss1 and Gpr101, a GnRH(1-5) receptor gene, revealed that few Kiss1-expressing cells coexpress Gpr101 in both ARC and AVPV. On the other hand, double ISH for Gpr101 and Slc17a6, a glutamatergic marker gene, revealed that 29.2% of ARC Gpr101-expressing cells coexpress Slc17a6. Further, most of the AVPV and ARC Kiss1-expressing cells coexpress Grin1, a gene encoding a subunit of NMDA receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that the GnRH(1-5)-GPR101 signaling facilitates LH release via indirect activation of kisspeptin neurons and that glutamatergic neurons may mediate the signaling. This provides a new aspect of kisspeptin- and GnRH-neuronal communication with the presence of stimulation from GnRH to kisspeptin neurons in female rats."	"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are critical for physiological synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory and for pathological plasticity and neuronal death. The GluN1 subunit is encoded by a single gene, GRIN1, with 8 splice variants, but whether the diversity generated by this splicing has physiological consequences remains enigmatic. Here, we generate mice lacking from the GluN1 exon 5-encoded N1 cassette (GluN1a mice) or compulsorily expressing this exon (GluN1b mice). Despite no differences in basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation in the hippocampus is significantly enhanced in GluN1a mice compared with that in GluN1b mice. Furthermore, GluN1a mice learn more quickly and have significantly better spatial memory performance than do GluN1b mice. In addition, in human iPSC-derived neurons in autism spectrum disorder NMDARs show characteristics of N1-lacking GluN1. Our findings indicate that alternative splicing of GluN1 is a mechanism for controlling physiological long-lasting synaptic potentiation, learning, and memory."	"In vitro chondrogenesis depends on the concerted action of numerous signalling pathways, many of which are sensitive to the changes of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor is a cation channel with high permeability for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Whilst there is now accumulating evidence for the expression and function of NMDA receptors in non-neural tissues including mature cartilage and bone, the contribution of glutamate signalling to the regulation of chondrogenesis is yet to be elucidated.We studied the role of glutamatergic signalling during the course of in vitro chondrogenesis in high density chondrifying cell cultures using single cell fluorescent calcium imaging, patch clamp, transient gene silencing, and western blotting.Here we show that key components of the glutamatergic signalling pathways are functional during in vitro chondrogenesis in a primary chicken chondrogenic model system. We also present the full glutamate receptor subunit mRNA and protein expression profile of these cultures. This is the first study to report that NMDA-mediated signalling may act as a key factor in embryonic limb bud-derived chondrogenic cultures as it evokes intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which are abolished by the GluN2B subunit-specific inhibitor ifenprodil. The function of NMDARs is essential for chondrogenesis as their functional knock-down using either ifenprodil or GRIN1 siRNA temporarily blocks the differentiation of chondroprogenitor cells. Cartilage formation was fully restored with the re-expression of the GluN1 protein.We propose a key role for NMDARs during the transition of chondroprogenitor cells to cartilage matrix-producing chondroblasts."	"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating and costly diseases, and prevalence of AD increases with age. Furthermore, females are twice as likely to suffer from AD compared to males. The cessation of reproductive steroid hormone production during menopause is hypothesized to cause this difference. Two rodent AD models, APP21 and APP+PS1, and wild type (WT) rats underwent an ovariectomy or sham surgery. Changes in learning and memory, brain histology, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, levels of mRNAs involved in Aβ production and clearance, and synaptic and cognitive function were determined. Barnes maze results showed that regardless of ovariectomy status, APP+PS1 rats learned slower and had poor memory retention. Ovariectomy caused learning impairment only in the APP21 rats. High levels of Aβ42 and very low levels of Aβ40 were observed in the brain cortices of APP+PS1 rats indicating limited endogenous PS1. The APP+PS1 rats had 43-fold greater formic acid soluble Aβ42 than Aβ40 at 17 months. Furthermore, levels of formic acid soluble Aβ42 increased 57-fold in ovariectomized APP+PS1 rats between 12 and 17 months of age. The mRNA encoding Grin1 significantly decreased due to ovariectomy whereas levels of Bace1, Chat, and Prkcb all decreased with age. The expression levels of mRNAs involved in Aβ degradation and AβPP cleavage (Neprilysin, Ide, Adam9, and Psenen) were found to be highly correlated with each other as well as hippocampal Aβ deposition. Taken together, these results indicate that both ovariectomy and genotype influence AD markers in a complex manner."	"The arginine vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) plays an important role in social behaviors including aggression, social learning and memory. Genetic removal of Avpr1b from mouse models results in deficits in aggression and short-term social recognition in adults. Avpr1b gene expression is highly enriched in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal cornu ammonis 2 (CA2) region. Activity of the hippocampal CA2 has been shown to be required for normal short-term social recognition and aggressive behaviors. Vasopressin acts to enhance synaptic responses of CA2 neurons through a NMDA-receptor dependent mechanism. Genetic removal of the obligatory subunit of the NMDA receptor (Grin1) within distinct hippocampal regions impairs non-social learning and memory. However, the question of a direct role for NMDA receptor activity in Avpr1b neurons to modulate social behavior remains unclear. To answer this question, we first created a novel transgenic mouse line with Cre recombinase knocked into the Avpr1b coding region to genetically target Avpr1b neurons. We confirmed this line has dense Cre expression throughout the dorsal and ventral CA2 regions of the hippocampus, along with scattered expression within the caudate-putamen and olfactory bulb (OB). Conditional removal of the NMDA receptor was achieved by crossing our line to an available floxed Grin1 line. The resulting mice were measured on a battery of social and memory behavioral tests. Surprisingly, we did not observe any differences between Avpr1b-Grin1 knockout mice and their wildtype siblings. We conclude that mice without typical NMDA receptor function in Avpr1b neurons can develop normal aggression as well as short-term social and object memory performance."	"Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the histone methyltransferase EHMT1. To study the impact of decreased EHMT1 function in human cells, we generated excitatory cortical neurons from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from KS patients. Neuronal networks of patient-derived cells exhibit network bursting with a reduced rate, longer duration, and increased temporal irregularity compared to control networks. We show that these changes are mediated by upregulation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit 1 correlating with reduced deposition of the repressive H3K9me2 mark, the catalytic product of EHMT1, at the GRIN1 promoter. In mice EHMT1 deficiency leads to similar neuronal network impairments with increased NMDAR function. Finally, we rescue the KS patient-derived neuronal network phenotypes by pharmacological inhibition of NMDARs. Summarized, we demonstrate a direct link between EHMT1 deficiency and NMDAR hyperfunction in human neurons, providing a potential basis for more targeted therapeutic approaches for KS."	"Calcium signaling plays an important role in gene expression. At the transcriptional level, this may underpin mammalian neuronal synaptic plasticity. Calcium influx into the postsynaptic neuron via: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates small GTPase Rac1 and other Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and stimulates calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) and CaMKI; α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors that are not impermeable to calcium ions, that is, those lacking the glutamate receptor-2 subunits, leads to activation of Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor proteins, which is coupled with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases signaling cascade; L-type voltage-gated calcium channels activates signaling pathways involving CaMKII, downstream responsive element antagonist modulator and distinct microdomains. Key members of these signaling cascades then translocate into the nucleus, where they alter the expression of genes involved in neuronal synaptic plasticity. At the post-transcriptional level, intracellular calcium level changes can change alternative splicing patterns; in the mammalian brain, alterations in calcium signaling via NMDA receptors is associated with exon silencing of the CI cassette of the NMDA R1 receptor (GRIN1) transcript by UAGG motifs in response to neuronal excitation. Regulation also occurs at the translational level; transglutaminase-2 (TG2) mediates calcium ion-regulated crosslinking of Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) translation-regulatory protein in TGFβ1-activated myofibroblasts; YB-1 binds smooth muscle α-actin mRNA and regulates its translational activity. Calcium signaling is also important in epigenetic regulation, for example in respect of changes in cytosine bases. Targeting calcium signaling may provide therapeutically useful options, for example to induce epigenetic reactivation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer patients."	"The majority of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the brain are composed of 2 GluN1 and 2 GluN2 subunits. The inclusion or exclusion of 1 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal domains of GluN1 results in 8 splicing variants that exhibit distinct temporal and spatial patterns of expression and functional properties. However, previous functional analyses of <i>Grin1</i> variants have been done using heterologous expression and the in vivo function of <i>Grin1</i> splicing is unknown. Here we show that N-terminal splicing of GluN1 has important functions in the maturation of excitatory synapses. The inclusion of exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> is up-regulated in several brain regions such as the thalamus and neocortex. We find that deletion of <i>Grin1</i> exon 5 disrupts the developmental remodeling of NMDARs in thalamic neurons and the effect is distinct from that of <i>Grin2a</i> (GluN2A) deletion. Deletion of <i>Grin2a</i> or exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> alone partially attenuates the shortening of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-EPSCs) during early life, whereas deletion of both <i>Grin2a</i> and exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> completely abolishes the developmental change in NMDAR-EPSC decay time. Deletion of exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> leads to an overproduction of excitatory synapses in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the cortex and increases seizure susceptibility in adult mice. Our findings demonstrate that N-terminal splicing of GluN1 has important functions in synaptic maturation and neuronal network excitability."	"The diaphragm muscle comprises various types of motor units that are recruited in an orderly fashion governed by the intrinsic electrophysiological properties (membrane capacitance as a function of somal surface area) of phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs). Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter at PhMNs and acts primarily via fast acting AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Differences in receptor expression may also contribute to motor unit recruitment order. We used single cell, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization to determine glutamatergic receptor mRNA expression across PhMNs based on their somal surface area. In adult male and female rats (n = 9) PhMNs were retrogradely labeled for analyses (n = 453 neurons). Differences in the total number and density of mRNA transcripts were evident across PhMNs grouped into tertiles according to somal surface area. A ~ 25% higher density of AMPA (Gria2) and NMDA (Grin1) mRNA expression was evident in PhMNs in the lower tertile compared to the upper tertile. These smaller PhMNs likely comprise type S motor units that are recruited first to accomplish lower force, ventilatory behaviors. In contrast, larger PhMNs with lower volume densities of AMPA and NMDA mRNA expression presumably comprise type FInt and FF motor units that are recruited during higher force, expulsive behaviors. Furthermore, there was a significantly higher cytosolic NMDA mRNA expression in small PhMNs suggesting a more important role for NMDA-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission at smaller PhMNs. These results are consistent with the observed order of motor unit recruitment and suggest a role for glutamatergic receptors in support of this orderly recruitment."	"This study aimed to investigate the new genetic etiologies of Rett syndrome (RTT) or Rett-like phenotypes.Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 44 Chinese patients with RTT or Rett-like phenotypes, in whom genetic analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 was negative.The detection rate was 31.8% (14/44). A de novo pathogenic variant (c.275_276ins AA, p. Cys92*) of KIF1A was identified in a girl with all core features of typical RTT. A patient with atypical RTT was detected having de novo GRIN1 pathogenic variant (c.2337C &gt; A, p. Val793Phe). Additionally, compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of PPT1 gene were detected in a girl, who initially displayed typical RTT features, but progressed into neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) afterwards. Pathogenic variants in KCNQ2, MEF2C, WDR45, TCF4, IQSEC2, and SDHA were also found in our cohort.It is the first time that pathogenic variants of GRIN1 and KIF1A were linked to RTT and Rett-like profiles. Our findings expanded the genetic heterogeneity of Chinese RTT or Rett-like patients, and also suggest that some patients with genetic metabolic disease such as NCL, might displayed Rett features initially, and clinical follow-up is essential for the diagnosis."	"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) mediate slow excitatory postsynaptic transmission in the central nervous system, thereby exerting a critical role in neuronal development and brain function. Rare genetic variants in the GRIN genes encoding NMDAR subunits segregated with neurological disorders. Here, we summarize the clinical presentations for 18 patients harboring 12 de novo missense variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B that alter residues in the M2 re-entrant loop, a region that lines the pore and is intolerant to missense variation. These de novo variants were identified in children with a set of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Evaluation of the receptor cell surface expression, pharmacological properties, and biophysical characteristics show that these variants can have modest changes in agonist potency, proton inhibition, and surface expression. However, voltage-dependent magnesium inhibition is significantly reduced in all variants. The NMDARs hosting a single copy of a mutant subunit showed a dominant reduction in magnesium inhibition for some variants. These variant NMDARs also show reduced calcium permeability and single-channel conductance, as well as altered open probability. The data suggest that M2 missense variants increase NMDAR charge transfer in addition to varied and complex influences on NMDAR functional properties, which may underlie the patients' phenotypes."	"During cortex development, fine interactions between pyramidal cells and migrating GABA neurons are required to orchestrate correct positioning of interneurons, but cellular and molecular mechanisms are not yet clearly understood. Functional and age-specific expression of NMDA receptors by neonate endothelial cells suggests a vascular contribution to the trophic role of glutamate during cortical development. Associating functional and loss-of-function approaches, we found that glutamate stimulates activity of the endothelial proteases MMP-9 and t-PA along the pial migratory route (PMR) and radial cortical microvessels. Activation of MMP-9 was NMDAR-dependent and abrogated in t-PA<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Time-lapse recordings revealed that glutamate stimulated migration of GABA interneurons along vessels through an NMDAR-dependent mechanism. In Gad67-GFP mice, t-PA invalidation and in vivo administration of an MMP inhibitor impaired positioning of GABA interneurons in superficial cortical layers, whereas Grin1 endothelial invalidation resulted in a strong reduction of the thickness of the pial migratory route, a marked decrease of the glutamate-induced MMP-9-like activity along the PMR and a depopulation of interneurons in superficial cortical layers. This study supports that glutamate controls the vessel-associated migration of GABA interneurons by regulating the activity of endothelial proteases. This effect requires endothelial NMDAR and is t-PA-dependent. These neurodevelopmental data reinforce the debate regarding safety of molecules with NMDA-antagonist properties administered to preterm and term neonates."	"Methamphetamine (Meth) seeking progressively increases after withdrawal (incubation of Meth craving). We previously demonstrated a role of anterior intralaminar nucleus of thalamus (AIT) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) projections in this incubation. Here, we examined molecular alterations in DMS and AIT neurons activated (identified by neuronal activity marker Fos) during &quot;incubated&quot; Meth-seeking relapse test after prolonged withdrawal.We trained male rats to self-administer Meth or saline (control condition) for 10 days (6 hr/day). Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we examined gene expression in Fos-positive (activated during a 2-hr relapse test) and Fos-negative (nonactivated) DMS and AIT neurons.In DMS, we found increased mRNA expressions of immediate early genes (IEGs) (Arc, Egr1, Npas4, Fosb), Trkb, glutamate receptors subunits (Gria3, Grin1, Grin2b, Grm1), and epigenetic enzymes (Hdac3, Hdac5, Crebbp) in Fos-positive neurons, compared with Fos-negative neurons. In AIT, we found that fewer genes (Egr1, Fosb, TrkB, Grin1, and Hdac5) exhibited increased mRNA expression in Fos-positive neurons. Unexpectedly, in both brain regions, gene alterations described above also occurred in drug-naïve saline self-administration control rats.These results demonstrated that transcriptional regulations in Fos-positive neurons activated during the relapse tests are brain region-specific but are not uniquely associated with drug exposure during the self-administration training."	"NMDA receptor dysfunction is central to the encephalopathies caused by missense mutations in the NMDA receptor subunit genes. Missense variants of GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B cause similar syndromes with varying severity of intellectual impairment, autism, epilepsy, and motor dysfunction. To gain insight into possible biomarkers of NMDAR hypofunction, we asked whether a loss-of-function variant in the Grin1 gene would cause structural changes in the brain that could be detected by MRI. We also studied the developmental trajectory of these changes to determine whether structural changes coincided with reported cognitive impairments in the mice. We performed magnetic resonance imaging in male Grin1-/- knockdown mice (GluN1KD) that were three, six, or twelve weeks old. Deformation-based morphometry was used to assess neuroanatomical differences. Volumetric reductions were detected in substantia nigra and striatum of GluN1KD mice at all ages. Changes in limbic structures were only evident at six weeks of age. Reductions in white matter volumes were first evident at three weeks, and additional deficits were detected at six and twelve weeks. FluoroJade immunofluorescence revealed degenerating neurons in twelve-week old GluN1KD mice. We conclude that Grin1 loss-of-function mutations cause volume reductions in dopaminergic structures early in development, while changes to limbic and white matter structures are delayed and are more pronounced in post-adolescent ages. The evidence of degenerating neurons in the mature brain indicates an ongoing process of cell loss as a consequence of NMDAR hypofunction."
"GRIN2A"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"GRIN-related developmental-epileptic encephalopathies are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, epilepsy including continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (CSWS), or epilepsy-aphasia spectrum phenotypes such as in Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Efficacy of IVIG treatment was recently reported in a patient with LKS related to GRIN2A mutation.We describe the efficacy of Immunotherapy in 5 consecutive patients (4 males, age range 6 months-13 years) with molecularly confirmed GRIN-related epileptic encephalopathy (4 with GRIN2A- related epilepsy-aphasia spectrum/epileptic encephalopathy with CSWS, accompanied by verbal, communicative and behavioural regression, and one patient with GRIN2D - related infantile developmental-epileptic encephalopathy). All patients had global developmental delay/ intellectual disability in various degrees, and were resistant to anticonvulsants, but none of the patients had frequent clinical seizures. All patients received monthly infusion of IVIG 2 g/ kg for 6 months; 2 patients were also treated with high-dose corticosteroids.Normalization or near normalization of the EEG was noted in 3 patients, from whom 2 had mild improvement in verbal abilities and communication skills. Perceptual/spatial abilities, as well as executive functions and attention span, remained significantly impaired.according to this preliminary, open-label study, Immunotherapy may lead to a clinical and electrographic improvement in patients with GRIN-related developmental-epileptic encephalopathies. Further studies to validate the efficacy of immunotherapy and the potential role of autoimmunity in GRIN-related disorders are needed."	"Non-synonymous mutations altering tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are widely studied. However, synonymous mutations, which do not alter the protein sequence, are rarely investigated in melanoma genome studies.We explored the role of somatic synonymous mutations in melanoma samples from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). The pathogenic synonymous mutation and neutral synonymous mutation data were used to assess the significance of pathogenic synonymous mutations in melanoma likely to affect genetic regulatory elements using Fisher's exact test. Poisson distribution probabilities of each gene were used to mine the genes with multiple potential functional synonymous mutations affecting regulatory elements.Concentrating on five types of genetic regulatory functions, we found that the mutational patterns of pathogenic synonymous mutations are mostly involved in exonic splicing regulators in near-splicing sites or inside DNase I hypersensitivity sites or non-optimal codon. Moreover, the sites of miRNA binding alteration exhibit a significantly lower rate of evolution than other sites. Finally, 12 genes were hit by recurrent potentially functional synonymous mutations, which showed statistical significance in the pathogenic mutations. Among them, nine genes (DNAH5, ADCY8, GRIN2A, KSR2, TECTA, RIMS2, XKR6, MYH1, SCN10A) have been reported to be mutated in melanoma, and other three genes (SLC9A2, CASR, SLC8A3) have a great potential to impact melanoma.These findings confirm the functional consequences of somatic synonymous mutations in melanoma, emphasizing the significance of research in future studies."	"To investigate the effects of long non-coding RNA RP1-90L14.1 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer LNCaP cells and the expressions of GRIN2A and BACE2.Using RT-PCR, we detected the expression of RP1-90L14.1 in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cells, transiently transfected the RP1-90L14.1 overexpression plasmid (the RP1-90L14.1 group) and vector plasmid (the LNCaP-NC group) into the LNCaP cells, and cultured the two groups of cells with ordinary medium and phenol red-free activated carbon adsorption medium (PRF-ACA). Then we examined the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of the cells by CCK-8 and Transwell, and determined the mRNA and protein expressions of GRIN2A and BACE2 by RT-PCR and Western blot.The expression of RP1-90L14.1 was significantly higher in the LNCaP-AI than in the LNCaP cells (8.49 ± 0.43 vs 2.53 ± 0.95, P &lt; 0.05), and so was that of LNCaP-RP1-90L14.1 in the RP1-90L14.1 than in the LNCaP-NC group after transfection (0.71 ± 0.22 vs 0.02 ± 0.01, P &lt; 0.05). The optical densities (OD) of the cells were 51.95% and 50.69% higher in the RP1-90L14.1 than in the LNCaP-NC group after 72 hours of culture with ordinary medium and phenol red-free ACA (1.22 ± 0.08 vs 0.08 ± 0.05, P &lt; 0.05; 0.79 ± 0.02 vs 0.53 ± 0.05, P &lt; 0.05), and 51.72% and 60.23% higher in the former than in the latter after 96 hours (1.72 ± 0.07 vs 1.13 ± 0.05, P &lt; 0.05; 1.18 ± 0.05 vs 0.73 ± 0.08, P &lt; 0.05). The numbers of the migrating cells cultured with common medium and PRF-ACA were markedly higher in the RP1-90L14.1 than in the LNCaP-NC group after transfection (682.0 ± 42.7 vs 422.0 ± 37.1, P &lt; 0.05; 419.0 ± 42.9 vs 251.0 ± 25.9, P &lt; 0.05), and so were those of the invading cells (507.0 ± 22.2 vs 274.0 ± 19.6, P &lt; 0.05; 352.0 ± 14.1 vs 216.0 ± 14.3, P &lt; 0.05). Statistically significant differences were observed between the RP1-90L14.1 and LNCaP-NC groups in the mRNA and protein expressions of GRIN2A (5.13 ± 0.89 vs 2.09 ± 0.54, P &lt; 0.05; 5.88 ± 0.29 vs 2.03 ± 0.22, P &lt; 0.05) and BACE2 (5.82 ± 0.50 vs 2.53 ± 0.30, P &lt; 0.05; 4.89 ± 0.19 vs 3.37 ± 0.13, P &lt; 0.05).　lncRNA RP1-90L14.1 may play important roles in the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. RP1-90L14.1 can promote the expressions of GRIN2A and BACE2 and may have an endogenous competitive relation with GRIN2A and BACE2."	"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that contribute to nearly all brain processes. Not surprisingly then, genetic variations in the genes encoding NMDAR subunits can be associated with neurodevelopmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders. These disease-associated variants (DAVs) present challenges, such as defining how DAV-induced alterations in receptor function contribute to disease progression and how to treat the affected individual clinically. As a starting point to overcome these challenges, we need to refine our understanding of the complexity of NMDAR structure function. In this regard, DAVs have expanded our knowledge of NMDARs because they do not just target well-known structure-function motifs, but rather give an unbiased view of structural elements that are important to the biology of NMDARs. Indeed, established NMDAR structure-function motifs have been validated by the appearance of disorders in patients where these motifs have been altered, and DAVs have identified novel structural features in NMDARs such as gating triads and hinges in the gating machinery. Still, the majority of DAVs remain unexplored and occur at sites in the protein with unidentified function or alter receptor properties in multiple and unanticipated ways. Detailed mechanistic and structural investigations are required of both established and novel motifs to develop a highly refined pathomechanistic model that accounts for the complex machinery that regulates NMDARs. Such a model would provide a template for rational drug design and a starting point for personalized medicine."	"<b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study was to comprehensively explore the relationship between genetic variations within GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIK1, GRIK4, GRID2, and ADHD. <b>Method:</b> Genotyping was performed with the Sequenom MassARRAY system in a two-stage case-control study. ADHD symptoms were assessed using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham version IV scale and the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test. In silico analysis was performed with website resources. <b>Results:</b> GRID2 rs1385405 showed a significant association with ADHD risk in the codominant model (OR = 2.208, 95% CI = [1.387, 3.515]) in the first stage and in the codominant model (OR = 1.874, 95% CI = [1.225, 2.869]) and recessive model (OR = 1.906, 95% CI = [1.265, 2.873]) in the second stage and related to inattention and hyperactivity symptom. In addition, rs1385405 disturbed the activity of exonic splicing enhancer and mediated GRID2 gene expression in the frontal cortex. <b>Conclusion:</b> our data provided evidence for the participation of GRID2 variants in conferring the risk of ADHD."	"We generated iPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a child with epilepsy carrying heterozygous missense mutation in GRIN2A, using integration free episomal vectors. These iPSCs express pluripotent markers, represent a normal karyotype and have the ability to differentiate into three germ layers."	"Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor, characterized by extensive brain invasion and rarely, systemic metastases. The pathogenesis of metastatic glioblastoma is largely unknown. We present the first integrated clinical/histologic/genetic analysis of 5 distinct brain and lung foci from a unique case of recurrent, multifocal, multicentric and metastatic glioblastoma. The initial right frontotemporal gliosarcoma received standard surgical/chemoradiation therapy and recurred 1.5 years later, co-occurring with three additional masses localized to the ipsilateral temporal lobe, cerebellum and lung. Synchronous metastatic lung carcinoma was suspected in this long-term smoker patient with family history of cancer. However, glioblastoma was confirmed in all tumors, although with different morphologic patterns, including ependymomatous and epithelioid. Genomic profiling revealed a germline FANCD2 variant of unknown significance, and a 4-gene somatic mutation signature shared by all tumors, consisting of TERT promoter and PTEN, RB1 and TP53 tumor suppressor mutations. Additional GRIN2A and ATM heterozygous mutations were selected in the cerebellar and lung foci, but were variably present in the supratentorial foci, indicating reduced post-therapeutic genetic evolution in brain foci despite morphologic variability. Significant genetic drift characterized the lung metastasis, likely explaining the known resistance of circulating glioblastoma cells to systemic seeding. MET overexpression was detected in the initial gliosarcoma and lung metastasis, possibly contributing to invasiveness. This comprehensive analysis sheds light on the temporospatial evolution of glioblastoma and underscores the importance of genetic testing for diagnosis and personalized therapy."	"Gene therapy may provide a valuable alternative for recognized therapeutic approaches to specific types of epilepsy. Focal lesion appears to be best candidate's form of therapeutic approaches for epilepsies. Gene therapy has been explored to generate antiepileptogenic (determent of progress of epilepsy in subject at threat after having an epileptogenic injury), antiseizure (diminution of severity of seizures), and disease-modifying (modification of the instinctive history of the disease) effects. Advancement of innovative therapeutic alternatives, specifically those with the capability to be remedial is assured. Channelopathies are a divergent class of human derangements that are induced by mutation in such genes coding for channel-regulating proteins or ion channels. Considerable number of channelopathies have been described that associate both non-excitable cells along with electrically effective tissues like skeletal, brain and heart or the smooth muscle. Developments in structural biology (Design of ion channels facilitate us to justify how mutations may cause to channelopathies) has advanced significantly in modern time. Considerable number of new studies showing the significance of mutation in mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, NMDA receptors, GABA receptors, potassium channels, G-protein coupled receptors and chromatin alteration are identified. Illustration of meticulous drug in epilepsy targeting new expression of mutations in SCN8A, GRIN2A, GRIN2D and KCNT1 are confered. Possible causes for the dearth of examples of meticulous therapeutic agent for loss-of-function mutations are depicted. In this current review emphasized on how bilological information on genetics along with gene network investigations have indicated that route way disturbed in epilepsy imbricate with another neurodevelopmental character along with cognition. Analysis of gene network attempt hopes to explore contemporary route for epilepsy, to decode epilepsy's association to another neurodevelopmental features and to build a new way to epilepsy medicine disclosure."	"To better understand the shared basis of language and mental health, this review examines the behavioral and neurobiological features of aberrant language in five major neuropsychiatric conditions. Special attention is paid to genes implicated in both language and neuropsychiatric disorders, as they reveal biological domains likely to underpin the processes controlling both.Abnormal language and communication are common manifestations of neuropsychiatric conditions, and children with impaired language are more likely to develop psychiatric disorders than their peers. Major themes in the genetics of both language and psychiatry include master transcriptional regulators, like FOXP2; key developmental regulators, like AUTS2; and mediators of neurotransmission, like GRIN2A and CACNA1C."	"Dopaminergic neuronal degeneration seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) might result from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A (<i>GRIN2A</i>) gene. We thus performed a meta-analysis exploring the relationship between the rs4998386 SNP of the <i>GRIN2A</i> gene and PD susceptibility.We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure for studies published between January 2005 and January 2019. The association between the rs4998386 polymorphism and PD susceptibility was evaluated by calculating the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Meta-analysis results did not show a significant association between the rs4998386 polymorphism of the <i>GRIN2A</i> gene and PD susceptibility when assuming an allelic model (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.76-1.07; <i>P</i> = .22; <i>I</i><sup>2 </sup>= 53%), a dominant model (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82-1.12; <i>P</i> = .62; <i>I</i><sup>2 </sup>= 64%), or a recessive model (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.38; <i>P</i> = .22; <i>I</i><sup>2 </sup>= 0%).Our meta-analysis found that the rs4998386 polymorphism of the <i>GRIN2A</i> gene is not associated with risk of PD in either Europeans or white Americans. However, large sample studies with different ethnicities should be conducted to establish the role of the rs4998386 polymorphism in PD pathophysiology."	"Cortical dopaminergic systems are critically involved in prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions, especially in working memory and neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3β) is highly associated with cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate)-independent dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor (D<sub>2</sub>R)-mediated signaling to affect dopamine-dependent behaviors. However, the mechanisms underlying the GSK-3β modulation of cognitive function via D<sub>2</sub>Rs remains unclear.This study explored how conditional cell-type-specific ablation of GSK-3β in D<sub>2</sub>R+ neurons (D<sub>2</sub>R-GSK-3β<sup>-/-</sup>) in the brain affects synaptic function in the medial PFC (mPFC). Both male and female (postnatal days 60-90) mice, including 140 D<sub>2</sub>R, 24 D<sub>1</sub>R, and 38 DISC1 mice, were used.This study found that NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function was significantly increased in layer V pyramidal neurons in mPFC of D<sub>2</sub>R-GSK-3β<sup>-/-</sup> mice, along with increased dopamine modulation of NMDAR-mediated current. Consistently, NR2A and NR2B protein levels were elevated in mPFC of D<sub>2</sub>R-GSK-3β<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This change was accompanied by a significant increase in enrichment of activator histone mark H3K27ac at the promoters of both Grin2a and Grin2b genes. In addition, altered short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, along with an increased spine density in layer V pyramidal neurons, were detected in D<sub>2</sub>R-GSK-3β<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Indeed, D<sub>2</sub>R-GSK-3β<sup>-/-</sup> mice also exhibited a resistance of working memory impairment induced by injection of NMDAR antagonist MK-801. Notably, either inhibiting GSK-3β or disrupting the D<sub>2</sub>R-DISC1 complex was able to reverse the mutant DISC1-induced decrease of NMDAR-mediated currents in the mPFC.This study demonstrates that GSK-3β modulates cognition via D<sub>2</sub>R-DISC1 interaction and epigenetic regulation of NMDAR expression and function."	"Variability in recovery among concussed athletes can be attributed to several risk factors. One risk factor not definitively explored is genetic variation. Genetic variations such as variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) in the promotor region are normal in the population, and can lead to disparities in the amount of protein produced, which could be associated with neuronal recovery. Little research has been conducted to investigate promoter VNTRs within genes responsible for recovery following a concussion. The authors implemented a prospective cohort design using a standardized concussion protocol to diagnose and follow 93 athletes to full recovery at three different sites to determine the association between promotor GT(n) VNTR polymorphisms and recovery time within concussed athletes. The GT(n) VNTR within the promoter region of glutamate ionotropic receptor <i>N-</i>methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type subunit 2A (<i>GRIN2A</i>), potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (<i>KCNH2</i>), glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 1 (<i>GRIK1</i>), and neurofilament light (<i>NEFL</i>) were genotyped using capillary electrophoresis. GT(n) VNTR promotor polymorphisms were dichotomized into long (L) and short (s) alleles. Using adjusted negative binomial regression models we found that athletes carrying the LL <i>GRIN2A</i> GT(n) VNTR within the promoter region were more likely to experience a prolonged concussion recovery, which resulted in their not being able to return to play for ∼60 days. Additionally, there was a trend toward significance, in which the ss <i>NEFL</i> GT(n) Caucasian athletes had prolonged concussion recovery. This could presumably be attributed to altered proteins or protein levels that disrupt neuronal recovery. This pilot study suggests that these VNTRs are associated with prolonged concussion recovery. In future studies, we plan to measure the extent to which the L or s alleles alter the level and the activity of the GluNR2a and NEFL proteins that <i>GRIN2A</i> and <i>NEFL</i> produce, respectively."	"To investigate the developmental exposure effect of diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) on postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, pregnant ICR mice were provided a diet containing DAS at 0, 0.6, 2.0, or 6.0 ppm from gestational day 6 to day 21 on weaning after delivery. Offspring were maintained through postnatal day (PND) 77 without DAS exposure. On PND 21, neural stem cells (NSCs) and all subpopulations of proliferating progenitor cells were suggested to decrease in number in the subgranular zone (SGZ) at ≥ 2.0 ppm. At 6.0 ppm, increases of SGZ cells showing TUNEL<sup>+</sup>, metallothionein-I/II<sup>+</sup>, γ-H2AX<sup>+</sup> or malondialdehyde<sup>+</sup>, and transcript downregulation of Ogg1, Parp1 and Kit without changing the level of double-stranded DNA break-related genes were observed in the dentate gyrus. This suggested induction of oxidative DNA damage of NSCs and early-stage progenitor cells, which led to their apoptosis. Cdkn2a, Rb1 and Trp53 downregulated transcripts, which suggested an increased vulnerability to DNA damage. Hilar PVALB<sup>+</sup> GABAergic interneurons decreased and Grin2a and Chrna7 were downregulated, which suggested suppression of type-2-progenitor cell differentiation. On PND 77, hilar RELN<sup>+</sup> interneurons increased at ≥ 2.0 ppm; at 6.0 ppm, RELN-related Itsn1 transcripts were upregulated and ARC<sup>+</sup> granule cells decreased. Increased RELN signals may ameliorate the response to the decreases of NSCs and ARC-mediated synaptic plasticity. These results suggest that DAS reversibly disrupts hippocampal neurogenesis by inducing oxidative cellular injury and suppressed differentiation of granule cell lineages. The no-observed-adverse-effect level of DAS for offspring neurogenesis was determined to be 0.6 ppm (0.09-0.29 mg/kg body weight/day)."	"Rapid advances in sequencing technology have led to an explosive increase in the number of genetic variants identified in patients with neurological disease and have also enabled the assembly of a robust database of variants in healthy individuals. A surprising number of variants in the <i>GRIN</i> genes that encode <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor subunits have been found in patients with various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. This review compares and contrasts the available information describing the clinical and functional consequences of genetic variations in <i>GRIN2A</i> and <i>GRIN2B.</i> Comparison of clinical phenotypes shows that <i>GRIN2A</i> variants are commonly associated with an epileptic phenotype but that <i>GRIN2B</i> variants are commonly found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. These observations emphasize the distinct roles that the gene products serve in circuit function and suggest that functional analysis of <i>GRIN2A</i> and <i>GRIN2B</i> variation may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms, which will allow more accurate subclassification of clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, characterization of the pharmacological properties of variant receptors could provide the first opportunity for translational therapeutic strategies for these <i>GRIN</i>-related neurological and psychiatric disorders."	"Genetic mutations are the major pathogenic factor of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In recent years, more and more ASD risk genes have been revealed, among which there are a group of transcriptional regulators. Considering the similarity of the core clinical phenotypes, it is possible that these different factors may regulate the expression levels of certain key targets. Identification of these targets could facilitate the understanding of the etiology and developing of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Therefore, we performed integrated transcriptome analyses of RNA-Seq and microarray data in multiple ASD mouse models and identified a number of common downstream genes in various brain regions, many of which are related to the structure and function of the synapse components or drug addiction. We then established protein-protein interaction networks of the overlapped targets and isolated the hub genes by 11 algorithms based on the topological structure of the networks, including Sdc4, Vegfa, and Cp in the Cortex-Adult subgroup, Gria1 in the Cortex-Juvenile subgroup, and Kdr, S1pr1, Ubc, Grm2, Grin2b, Nrxn1, Pdyn, Grin3a, Itgam, Grin2a, Gabra2, and Camk4 in the Hippocampus-Adult subgroup, many of which have been associated with ASD in previous studies. Finally, we cross compared our results with human brain transcriptional data sets and verified several key candidates, which may play important role in the pathology process of ASD, including SDC4, CP, S1PR1, UBC, PDYN, GRIN2A, GABRA2, and CAMK4. In summary, by integrated bioinformatics analysis, we have identified a series of potentially important molecules for future ASD research. Autism Res 2020, 13: 352-368. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Abnormal transcriptional regulation accounts for a significant portion of Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this study, we performed transcriptome analyses of mouse models to identify common downstream targets of transcriptional regulators involved in ASD. We identified several recurrent target genes that are close related to the common pathological process of ASD, including SDC4, CP, S1PR1, UBC, PDYN, GRM2, NRXN1, GRIN3A, ITGAM, GRIN2A, GABRA2, and CAMK4. These results provide potentially important targets for understanding the molecular mechanism of ASD."	"Lithium has been the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD) for more than six decades. Although the molecular effects of lithium have been studied extensively and gene expression changes are generally believed to be involved, the specific mechanisms of action that mediate mood regulation are still not known. In this study, a multi-step approach was used to explore the transcriptional changes that may underlie lithium's therapeutic efficacy. First, we identified genes that are associated both with lithium exposure and with BD, and second, we performed differential expression analysis of these genes in brain tissue samples from BD patients (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 42). To identify genes that are regulated by lithium exposure, we used high-sensitivity RNA-sequencing of corpus callosum (CC) tissue samples from lithium-treated (n = 8) and non-treated (n = 9) rats. We found that lithium exposure significantly affected 1108 genes (FDR &lt; 0.05), 702 up-regulated and 406 down-regulated. These genes were mostly enriched for molecular functions related to signal transduction, including well-established lithium-related pathways such as mTOR and Wnt signaling. To identify genes with differential expression in BD, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis on BD-associated genetic variants from the most recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) using three different gene expression databases. We found 307 unique eQTL genes regulated by BD-associated variants, of which 12 were also significantly modulated by lithium treatment in rats. Two of these showed differential expression in the CC of BD cases: RPS23 was significantly down-regulated (p = 0.0036, fc = 0.80), while GRIN2A showed suggestive evidence of down-regulation in BD (p = 0.056, fc = 0.65). Crucially, GRIN2A was also significantly up-regulated by lithium in the rat brains (p = 2.2e-5, fc = 1.6), which suggests that modulation of GRIN2A expression may be a part of the therapeutic effect of the drug. These results indicate that the recent upsurge in research on this central component of the glutamatergic system, as a target of novel therapeutic agents for affective disorders, is warranted and should be intensified."	"The majority of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the brain are composed of 2 GluN1 and 2 GluN2 subunits. The inclusion or exclusion of 1 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal domains of GluN1 results in 8 splicing variants that exhibit distinct temporal and spatial patterns of expression and functional properties. However, previous functional analyses of <i>Grin1</i> variants have been done using heterologous expression and the in vivo function of <i>Grin1</i> splicing is unknown. Here we show that N-terminal splicing of GluN1 has important functions in the maturation of excitatory synapses. The inclusion of exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> is up-regulated in several brain regions such as the thalamus and neocortex. We find that deletion of <i>Grin1</i> exon 5 disrupts the developmental remodeling of NMDARs in thalamic neurons and the effect is distinct from that of <i>Grin2a</i> (GluN2A) deletion. Deletion of <i>Grin2a</i> or exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> alone partially attenuates the shortening of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-EPSCs) during early life, whereas deletion of both <i>Grin2a</i> and exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> completely abolishes the developmental change in NMDAR-EPSC decay time. Deletion of exon 5 of <i>Grin1</i> leads to an overproduction of excitatory synapses in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the cortex and increases seizure susceptibility in adult mice. Our findings demonstrate that N-terminal splicing of GluN1 has important functions in synaptic maturation and neuronal network excitability."	"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) mediate slow excitatory postsynaptic transmission in the central nervous system, thereby exerting a critical role in neuronal development and brain function. Rare genetic variants in the GRIN genes encoding NMDAR subunits segregated with neurological disorders. Here, we summarize the clinical presentations for 18 patients harboring 12 de novo missense variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B that alter residues in the M2 re-entrant loop, a region that lines the pore and is intolerant to missense variation. These de novo variants were identified in children with a set of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Evaluation of the receptor cell surface expression, pharmacological properties, and biophysical characteristics show that these variants can have modest changes in agonist potency, proton inhibition, and surface expression. However, voltage-dependent magnesium inhibition is significantly reduced in all variants. The NMDARs hosting a single copy of a mutant subunit showed a dominant reduction in magnesium inhibition for some variants. These variant NMDARs also show reduced calcium permeability and single-channel conductance, as well as altered open probability. The data suggest that M2 missense variants increase NMDAR charge transfer in addition to varied and complex influences on NMDAR functional properties, which may underlie the patients' phenotypes."	"<i>Background</i>: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 recently estimated that after opioid and cannabis use disorders, cocaine use disorders were among the most common, with around 5.8 million cases around the world. Several genome-wide expression studies (GWES) for cocaine misuse have been carried out in brain tissues from patients and controls and in mouse and rat models.<i>Objectives</i>: In the current work, we used a convergent functional genomics approach to identify novel candidate genes and pathways for cocaine misuse.<i>Methods</i>: We carried out meta-analyses for available GWES for cocaine misuse in humans and mouse and rat models (three, four, and two GWES, respectively). Multiple lines of evidence (GWES, genome-wide association and epigenomic data) were integrated to prioritize top candidate genes, and a functional enrichment analysis was carried out.<i>Results</i>: Several top candidate genes supported by multiple lines of genomic evidence, and with known roles in brain plasticity, were identified: <i>APP, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, KCNA2, MAP4, PCDH10, PPP3CA, SNCB</i>, and <i>SV2C</i>. An enrichment of genes regulated by the AP1 transcription factor was found.<i>Conclusion</i>: This is the first meta-analysis of GWES for cocaine misuse in humans and mouse and rat models. The analysis of convergence of multiple lines of genome-wide evidence identified novel candidate genes and pathways for cocaine misuse, which are of basic and clinical importance."	"DNA methylation has an important role in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced gastric cancer (GC) processes and development. The aim of this study was to search genome-scale epigenetic modifications for studying pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced GC, and to find factors and powerful signature related to survival and prognosis. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), to identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs). Functional enrichment analysis of the screened genes was performed, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. The TCGA DNA methylation databases and 55 H. pylori-infected GC cases of GEO RNA sequencing (GSE62254) were utilized for prognostic value validation of hub genes. Finally, a prognosis-related risk signature was identified by a series of bioinformatics analysis for H. pylori-induced GC patients. Totally, 161 DMGs were identified. Pathway analysis showed that all MDEGs mainly associated with Ras signaling pathway, renal cell carcinoma, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Five hub genes including CACNB2, GNB4, GRIN2A, MEF2C, and PREX1 were screened as independent prognostic factors in H. pylori-induced GC patients. Two-gene (CACNB2 and MEF2C) risk signature was constructed for predicting the overall survival of H. pylori-induced GC patients. Our study indicated possible MDEGs and pathways in H. pylori-induced GC by bioinformatics analysis, which may provide novel insights for unraveling pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced GC. Hub genes might serve as aberrantly methylation-based biomarkers for clinical diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of H. pylori-induced GC."
"KCNB1"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Expression of thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4), a matricellular protein, is increased in the heart tissue of various cardiac disease models. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, TSP-4 inhibits L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC) activity. Although TSP-4 might be related to the electrophysiological properties in heart, it remains to be clarified. The present study aimed to clarify the effects of TSP-4 on action potential (AP), LTCC current (I<sub>CaL</sub>) and voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channel current (I<sub>Kv</sub>) in rat isolated ventricular myocytes by a patch clamp technique. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the heart of adult male Wistar rats. The ventricular myocytes were treated with TSP-4 (5 nM) or its vehicle for 4 hr. Then, whole-cell patch clamp technique was performed to measure AP (current-clamp mode) and I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>Kv</sub> (voltage-clamp mode). The mRNA expression of Kv channels was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. TSP-4 had no effect on the resting membrane potential and peak amplitude of AP. On the other hand, TSP-4 significantly prolonged AP duration (APD) at 50% and 90% repolarization. TSP-4 significantly inhibited the peak amplitudes of I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>Kv</sub>. TSP-4 had no effect on mRNA expression of Kv channels (Kcna4, Kcna5, Kcnb1, Kcnd2 and Kcnd3). The present study for the first time demonstrated that TSP-4 prolongs APD in rat ventricular myocytes, which is possibly mediated through the suppression of Kv channel activity."	"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a kind of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that regulate the expression of target genes and play a role in the occurrence and development of cancers. Colon cancer (COAD) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in COAD is still confusing. In this study, we obtain miRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression profiles of COAD from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. After preliminary data screening and preprocessing, we acquire the expression data of 894 miRNAs and 17,019 mRNAs. Then, compared with the normal samples, 39 upregulated miRNAs and 54 downregulated miRNAs are identified by differential expression analysis. Furthermore, we obtain 1,487 upregulated mRNAs and 2,847 downregulated mRNAs. We confirm nine key miRNAs related to the survival rate of COAD patients. Moreover, by using bioinformatics methods, we get 461 common genes from both the target genes of these nine key miRNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs. Through analyzing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of these 461 common genes and survival analysis, we confirm five hub genes as promising biomarkers for COAD prognosis. It is worth mentioning that no previous reports have found that PGR and KCNB1 are related to COAD. We expect these key miRNAs and hub genes will provide a new way for the study of COAD."	"An increasing number of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies have been correlated with variants of ion channel genes, and in particular of potassium channels genes, such as KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNB1, KCNQ2, KCTD7 and KCNT1. Here we report a child with an early severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, spastic tetraplegia, opisthotonos attacks. The whole exome sequencing showed the de novo heterozygous variant c.1411G &gt; C (p.Val471Leu) in the KCNC2 gene. Although this is, to our knowledge, the first case of encephalopathy associated with a KCNC2 gene variant, and further confirmatory studies are needed, previous preclinical and clinical evidence seems to suggest that KCNC2 is a new candidate epilepsy gene."	"Large genomic databases of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are helpful resources of genomic variations in complex and heterogeneous conditions, as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the role of rare copy number variations (CNVs) and exonic de novo variants, in a molecularly unexplored Brazilian cohort of 30 ASD trios (n = 90), by performing a meta-analysis of our findings in more than 20,000 patients from NDD cohorts. We identified three pathogenic CNVs: two duplications on 1q21 and 17p13, and one deletion on 4q35. CNVs meta-analysis (n = 8,688 cases and n = 3,591 controls) confirmed 1q21 relevance by identifying duplications in other 16 ASD patients. Exome analysis led the identification of seven de novo variants in ASD genes (SFARI list): three loss-of-function pathogenic variants in CUL3, CACNA1H, and SHANK3; one missense pathogenic variant in KCNB1; and three deleterious missense variants in ATP10A, ANKS1B, and DOCK1. From the remaining 12 de novo variants in non-previous ASD genes, we prioritized PRPF8 and RBM14. Meta-analysis (n = 13,754 probands; n = 2,299 controls) identified six and two additional patients with validated de novo variants in PRPF8 and RBM14, respectively. By comparing the de novo variants with a previously established mutational rate model, PRPF8 showed nominal significance before multiple test correction (P = 0.039, P-value adjusted = 0.079, binomial test), suggesting its relevance to ASD. Approximately 60% of our patients presented comorbidities, and the diagnostic yield was estimated in 23% (7/30: three pathogenic CNVs and four pathogenic de novo variants). Our uncharacterized Brazilian cohort with tetra-hybrid ethnic composition was a valuable resource to validate and identify possible novel candidate loci. Autism Res 2020, 13: 199-206. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: We believed that to study an unexplored autistic population, such as the Brazilian, could help to find novel genes for autism. In order to test this idea, with our limited budget, we compared candidate genes obtained from genomic analyses of 30 children and their parents, with those of more than 20,000 individuals from international studies. Happily, we identified a genetic cause in 23% of our patients and suggest a possible novel candidate gene for autism (PRPF8)."	"Voltage-gated potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel subfamily B member 1 (KCNB1, Kv2.1) and integrin-α5 form macromolecular complexes-named integrin-α5-KCNB1 complexes (IKCs)-in the human brain, but their function was poorly understood. Here we report that membrane depolarization triggered IKC intracellular signals mediated by small GTPases of the Ras subfamily and protein kinase B (Akt) to advance the development of filopodia and lamellipodia in Chinese hamster ovary cells, stimulate their motility, and enhance neurite outgrowth in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. Five KCNB1 mutants (L211P, R312H G379R, G381R, and F416L) linked to severe infancy or early-onset epileptic encephalopathy exhibited markedly defective conduction. However, although L211P, G379R, and G381R normally engaged Ras/Akt and stimulated cell migration, R312H and F416L failed to activate Ras/Akt signaling and did not enhance cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that IKCs modulate cellular plasticity <i>via</i> Ras and Akt signaling. As such, defective IKCs may cause epilepsy through mechanisms other than dysregulated excitability such as, for example, abnormal neuronal development and resulting synaptic connectivity.-Yu, W., Shin, M. R., Sesti, F. Complexes formed with integrin-α5 and KCNB1 potassium channel wild type or epilepsy-susceptibility variants modulate cellular plasticity <i>via</i> Ras and Akt signaling."	"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, developmental disability, and epilepsy are characterized by abnormal brain development that may affect cognition, learning, behavior, and motor skills. High co-occurrence (comorbidity) of NDDs indicates a shared, underlying biological mechanism. The genetic heterogeneity and overlap observed in NDDs make it difficult to identify the genetic causes of specific clinical symptoms, such as seizures.We present a computational method, MAGI-S, to discover modules or groups of highly connected genes that together potentially perform a similar biological function. MAGI-S integrates protein-protein interaction and co-expression networks to form modules centered around the selection of a single &quot;seed&quot; gene, yielding modules consisting of genes that are highly co-expressed with the seed gene. We aim to dissect the epilepsy phenotype from a general NDD phenotype by providing MAGI-S with high confidence NDD seed genes with varying degrees of association with epilepsy, and we assess the enrichment of de novo mutation, NDD-associated genes, and relevant biological function of constructed modules.The newly identified modules account for the increased rate of de novo non-synonymous mutations in autism, intellectual disability, developmental disability, and epilepsy, and enrichment of copy number variations (CNVs) in developmental disability. We also observed that modules seeded with genes strongly associated with epilepsy tend to have a higher association with epilepsy phenotypes than modules seeded at other neurodevelopmental disorder genes. Modules seeded with genes strongly associated with epilepsy (e.g., SCN1A, GABRA1, and KCNB1) are significantly associated with synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, and calcium signaling pathways. On the other hand, modules found with seed genes that are not associated or weakly associated with epilepsy are mostly involved with RNA regulation and chromatin remodeling.In summary, our method identifies modules enriched with de novo non-synonymous mutations and can capture specific networks that underlie the epilepsy phenotype and display distinct enrichment in relevant biological processes. MAGI-S is available at https://github.com/jchow32/magi-s ."	"Pathogenic variants in KCNB1, encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel K<sub>V</sub> 2.1, are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). Previous functional studies on a limited number of KCNB1 variants indicated a range of molecular mechanisms by which variants affect channel function, including loss of voltage sensitivity, loss of ion selectivity, and reduced cell-surface expression.We evaluated a series of 17 KCNB1 variants associated with DEE or other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) to rapidly ascertain channel dysfunction using high-throughput functional assays. Specifically, we investigated the biophysical properties and cell-surface expression of variant K<sub>V</sub> 2.1 channels expressed in heterologous cells using high-throughput automated electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry-flow cytometry.Pathogenic variants exhibited diverse functional defects, including altered current density and shifts in the voltage dependence of activation and/or inactivation, as homotetramers or when coexpressed with wild-type K<sub>V</sub> 2.1. Quantification of protein expression also identified variants with reduced total K<sub>V</sub> 2.1 expression or deficient cell-surface expression.Our study establishes a platform for rapid screening of K<sub>V</sub> 2.1 functional defects caused by KCNB1 variants associated with DEE and other NDDs. This will aid in establishing KCNB1 variant pathogenicity and the mechanism of dysfunction, which will enable targeted strategies for therapeutic intervention based on molecular phenotype.

"Excitation-contraction coupling in normal cardiac function is performed with well balanced and coordinated functioning but with complex dynamic interactions between functionally connected membrane ionic currents. However, their genomic investigations provide essential information on the regulation of diseases by their transcripts. Therefore, we examined the gene expression levels of the most important voltage-gated ionic channels such as Na<sup>+</sup>-channels (SCN5A), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (CACNA1C and CACNA1H), and K<sup>+</sup>-channels, including transient outward (KCND2, KCNA2, KCNA5, KCNA8), inward rectifier (KCNJ2, KCNJ12, KCNJ4), and delayed rectifier (KCNB1) in left ventricular tissues from either ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy (ICM or DCM). We also examined the mRNA levels of ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup>-channels (KCNJ11, ABCC9) and ERG-family channels (KCNH2). We further determined the mRNA levels of ryanodine receptors (RyR2; ARVC2), phospholamban (PLB or PLN), SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-pump (SERCA2; ATP2A1), an accessory protein FKBP12 (PPIASE), protein kinase A (PPNAD4), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2G). The mRNA levels of SCN5A, CACNA1C, and CACNA1H in both groups decreased markedly in the heart samples with similar significance, while KvLQT1 genes were high with depressed Kv4.2. The KCNJ11 and KCNJ12 in both groups were depressed, while the KCNJ4 level was significantly high. More importantly, the KCNA5 gene was downregulated only in the ICM, while the KCNJ2 was upregulated only in the DCM. Besides, mRNA levels of ARVC2 and PLB were significantly high compared to the controls, whereas others (ATP2A1, PPIASE, PPNAD4, and CAMK2G) were decreased. Importantly, the increases of KCNB1 and KCNJ11 were more prominent in the ICM than DCM, while the decreases in ATP2A1 and FKBP1A were more prominent in DCM compared to ICM. Overall, this study was the first to demonstrate that the different levels of changes in gene profiles via different types of cardiomyopathy are prominent particularly in some K<sup>+</sup>-channels, which provide further information about our knowledge of how remodeling processes can be differentiated in HF originated from different pathological conditions."	"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) refer to a heterogeneous group of devastating neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants in KCNB1 have been recently reported in patients with early-onset DEE. KCNB1 encodes the α subunit of the delayed rectifier voltage-dependent potassium channel K<sub>v</sub> 2.1. We review the 37 previously reported patients carrying 29 distinct KCNB1 variants and significantly expand the mutational spectrum describing 18 novel variants from 27 unreported patients. Most variants occur de novo and mainly consist of missense variants located on the voltage sensor and the pore domain of K<sub>v</sub> 2.1. We also report the first inherited variant (p.Arg583*). KCNB1-related encephalopathies encompass a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders with predominant language difficulties and behavioral impairment. Eighty-five percent of patients developed epilepsies with variable syndromes and prognosis. Truncating variants in the C-terminal domain are associated with a less-severe epileptic phenotype. Overall, this report provides an up-to-date review of the mutational and clinical spectrum of KCNB1, strengthening its place as a causal gene in DEEs and emphasizing the need for further functional studies to unravel the underlying mechanisms."	"Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of α-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 α-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory α-subunits plus β-subunits that, similar to silent α-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of α-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of α-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of α-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review in the context of regulatory interactions between electrically-active and regulatory subunits."	"Infantile spasms (IS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with heterogeneous etiologies including many genetic causes. Genetic studies have identified pathogenic variants in over 30 genes as causes of IS. Many of these genetic causes are extremely rare, with only one reported incidence in an individual with IS. To better understand the genetic landscape of IS, we used targeted sequencing to screen 42 candidate IS genes and 53 established developmental and epileptic encephalopathy genes in 92 individual with IS. We identified a genetic diagnosis for 7.6% of our cohort, including pathogenic variants in KCNB1 (n = 2), GNAO1 (n = 1), STXBP1 (n = 1), SLC35A2 (n = 1), TBL1XR1 (n = 1), and KIF1A (n = 1). Our data emphasize the genetic heterogeneity of IS and will inform the diagnosis and management of individuals with this devastating disorder."	"Gastrin signaling mediated through cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R) and its downstream molecules is altered in pancreatic cancer. CCK2R antagonists, YF476 (netazepide) and JNJ-26070109, were tested systematically for their effect on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in Kras<sup>G12D</sup> mice. After dose selection using wild-type mice, six-week-old p48<sup>Cre/+</sup> -LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup> (22-24 per group) genetically engineered mice (GEM) were fed AIN-76A diets containing 0, 250, or 500 ppm JNJ-26070109 or YF-476 for 38 weeks. At termination, pancreata were collected, weighed, and evaluated for PanINs and PDAC. Results demonstrated that control-diet-fed mice showed 69% (males) and 33% (females) incidence of PDAC. Administration of low and high dose JNJ-26070109 inhibited the incidence of PDAC by 88% and 71% (P &lt; .004) in male mice and by 100% and 24% (P &gt; .05) in female mice, respectively. Low and high dose YF476 inhibited the incidence of PDAC by 74% (P &lt; .02) and 69% (P &lt; .02) in male mice and by 45% and 33% (P &gt; .05) in female mice, respectively. Further, transcriptome analysis showed downregulation of Cldn1, Sstr1, Apod, Gkn1, Siglech, Cyp2c44, Bnc1, Fmo2, 623169, Kcne4, Slc27a6, Cma1, Rho GTPase activating protein 18, and Gpr85 genes in JNJ-26070109-treated mice compared with untreated mice. YF476-treated mouse pancreas showed downregulation of Riks, Zpbp, Ntf3, Lrrn4, Aass, Skint3, Kcnb1, Dgkb, Ddx60, and Aspn gene expressions compared with untreated mouse pancreas. Overall, JNJ-26070109 showed better chemopreventive efficacy than YF476. However, caution is recommended when selecting doses, as the agents appeared to exhibit gender-specific effects."	"The neuronal cell death-promoting loss of cytoplasmic K<sup>+</sup> following injury is mediated by an increase in Kv2.1 potassium channels in the plasma membrane. This phenomenon relies on Kv2.1 binding to syntaxin 1A via 9 amino acids within the channel intrinsically disordered C terminus. Preventing this interaction with a cell and blood-brain barrier-permeant peptide is neuroprotective in an in vivo stroke model. Here a rational approach was applied to define the key molecular interactions between syntaxin and Kv2.1, some of which are shared with mammalian uncoordinated-18 (munc18). Armed with this information, we found a small molecule Kv2.1-syntaxin-binding inhibitor (cpd5) that improves cortical neuron survival by suppressing SNARE-dependent enhancement of Kv2.1-mediated currents following excitotoxic injury. We validated that cpd5 selectively displaces Kv2.1-syntaxin-binding peptides from syntaxin and, at higher concentrations, munc18, but without affecting either synaptic or neuronal intrinsic properties in brain tissue slices at neuroprotective concentrations. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of syntaxin in neuronal cell death and validate an important target for neuroprotection."	"Primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare tumor subtype accounting for around 0.9% of lung cancers. At present, research on LELC mainly focuses on pathological diagnosis, while the molecular mutation landscape is still unclear.A 72-year-old female presented a productive cough for three weeks followed by severe symptoms for another week. Respiratory sounds were weak and coarser in the right lung field. F-FDG PET-CTA showed a hypermetabolic mass in the upper lobe of the right lung as well as the enlargement of right hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry staining of the biopsy established the diagnosis of primary pulmonary LELC. After thoracoscopic-assisted radical resection of right lung cancer and middle lobe of right lung, the patient's vital signs were stable without apparent productive cough, chest pain, chest tightness and other subjective discomforts. Furtherwhole exome sequencing of the patient's tumor tissue and leukocytes (served as a germline mutation control) revealed 613 somatic gene mutations, and of which mutations in PRIM2, KCNB1, CDH1, and ATRX were most likely related to the LELC pathogenesis. The recurrence of gene mutations from various cancers database and a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 18.7 mutations/mb were revealed as well.Our findings have illustrated the genomic profile of a primary pulmonary LELC case and provided a positive biomarker that immune checkpoint blockade is potentially effective for this patient in further treatment."	"The KCNE2 single transmembrane-spanning voltage-gated potassium (K<sub>v</sub>) channel β subunit is ubiquitously expressed and essential for normal function of a variety of cell types, often <i>via</i> regulation of the KCNQ1 K<sub>v</sub> channel. A polymorphism upstream of <i>KCNE2</i> is associated with reduced lung function in human populations, but the pulmonary consequences of <i>KCNE2</i> gene disruption are unknown. Here, germline deletion of mouse <i>Kcne2</i> reduced pulmonary expression of potassium channel α subunits <i>Kcnq1</i> and <i>Kcnb1</i> but did not alter expression of other <i>Kcne</i> genes. Kcne2 colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with Kcnq1 in mouse lungs, suggesting the formation of pulmonary Kcnq1-Kcne2 potassium channel complexes. <i>Kcne2</i> deletion reduced blood O<sub>2</sub>, increased CO<sub>2</sub>, increased pulmonary apoptosis, and increased inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Consistent with increased pulmonary vascular leakage, <i>Kcne2</i> deletion increased plasma, BAL albumin, and the BAL:plasma albumin concentration ratio. <i>Kcne2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mouse lungs exhibited baseline induction of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway but were less able to respond <i>via</i> this pathway to imposed pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). We conclude that KCNE2 regulates KCNQ1 in the lungs and is required for normal lung function and resistance to pulmonary IRI. Our data support a causal relationship between <i>KCNE2</i> gene disruption and lung dysfunction.-Zhou, L., Köhncke, C., Hu, Z., Roepke, T. K., Abbott, G. W. The KCNE2 potassium channel β subunit is required for normal lung function and resilience to ischemia and reperfusion injury."	"DNA methylation studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) thus far have focused on disease susceptibility but not progression.In this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), we aim to identify methylation markers associated with faster cognitive decline or motor progression in PD.We included 232 PD patients from the Parkinson's Environment and Gene follow-up study who provided blood samples at enrolment. Information on cognitive and motor function was collected using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). For EWAS analyses, we used a robust measure of correlation: biweight midcorrelations, t-tests, and Cox proportional hazard models. We also conducted weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify CpG modules associated with cognitive decline or motor progression in PD.Among 197 individuals of European ancestry, with our EWAS approach we identified 7 genome-wide significant CpGs associated with a MMSE 4-point decline and 8 CpGs associated with faster motor progression (i.e., rate of UPDRS increase ≥5-point/year). The most interesting CpGs for cognitive decline include cg17445913 in KCNB1 (cor = 0.36, p = 6.85×10-7) and cg02920897 in DLEU2 (cor = 0.34, p = 3.23×10-6), while for motor progression it was cg01754178 in PTPRN2 (cor = - 0.34, p = 2.07×10-6). In WGCNA, motor progression related modules were enriched for genes related to neuronal synaptic functions, Wnt signaling pathway, and mitochondrial apoptosis.Our study provides the first epigenetic evidence that differential methylation in genes previously identified as being associated with cognitive impairment, neuronal synaptic function, Wnt signaling pathway, and mitochondrial apoptosis is associated with cognitive and motor progression in PD."	"Preterm birth (PTB), defined as infant delivery before 37 weeks of completed gestation, results from the interaction of both genetic and environmental components and constitutes a complex multifactorial syndrome. Transcriptome analysis of PTB has proven challenging because of the multiple causes of PTB and the numerous maternal and fetal gestational tissues that must interact to facilitate parturition. The transcriptome of the chorioamnion membranes at the site of rupture in PTB and term fetuses may reflect the molecular pathways of preterm labor.In this work, chorioamnion membranes from severe preterm and term fetuses were analyzed using RNA sequencing. Functional annotations and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes were performed with the GAGE and GOSeq packages. A subset of differentially expressed genes in PTB was validated in a larger cohort using qRT-PCR and by comparing our results with genes and pathways previously reported in the literature.A total of 270 genes were differentially expressed (DE): 252 were upregulated and 18 were down-regulated in severe preterm births relative to term births. Inflammatory and immunological pathways were upregulated in PTB. Both types of pathways were previously suggested to lead to PTB. Pathways that were not previously reported in PTB, such as the hemopoietic pathway, appeared upregulated in preterm membranes. A group of 18 downregulated genes discriminated between term and severe preterm cases. These genes potentially characterize a severe preterm transcriptome pattern and therefore are candidate genes for understanding the syndrome. Some of the downregulated genes are involved in the nervous system, morphogenesis (WNT1, DLX5, PAPPA2) and ion channel complexes (KCNJ16, KCNB1), making them good candidates as biomarkers of PTB.The identification of this DE gene pattern will help with the development of a multi-gene disease classifier. These markers were generated in an admixed South American population in which PTB has a high incidence. Since the genetic background may differentially impact different populations, it is necessary to include populations such as those from South America and Africa, which are usually excluded from high-throughput approaches. These classifiers should be compared to those in other populations to obtain a global landscape of PTB."	"Voltage-gated potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel sub-family B member 1 (KCNB1, Kv2.1) is known to undergo oxidation-induced oligomerization during aging but whether this process affects brain's physiology was not known. Here, we used 10, 16 and 22 month-old transgenic mice overexpressing a KCNB1 variant that does not oligomerize (Tg-C73A) and as control, mice overexpressing the wild type (Tg-WT) channel and non-transgenic (non-Tg) mice to elucidate the effects of channel's oxidation on cognitive function. Aging mice in which KCNB1 oligomerization is negligible (Tg-C73A), performed significantly better in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test of working memory compared to non-Tg or Tg-WT mice. KCNB1 and synapsin-1 co-immunoprecipitated and the cognitive impairment in the MWM was associated with moderate loss of synapsin-1 in pre-synaptic structures of the hippocampus, whereas neurodegeneration and neuronal loss were not significantly different in the various genotypes. We conclude that moderate oxidation of the KCNB1 channel during aging can influence neuronal networks by affecting synaptic function."	"Voltage-gated potassium channels are expressed in a wide variety of excitable and non-excitable cells and regulate numerous cellular functions. The activity of ion channels can be modulated by direct interaction or/and functional coupling with other proteins including auxiliary subunits, scaffold proteins and the cytoskeleton. Here, we evaluated the influence of the actin-based cytoskeleton on the Kv2.1 channel using pharmacological and electrophysiological methods. We found that disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton by latrunculin B resulted in the regulation of the Kv2.1 inactivation mechanism; it shifted the voltage of half-maximal inactivation toward negative potentials by approximately 15 mV, accelerated the rate of closed-state inactivation, and delayed the recovery rate from inactivation. The actin cytoskeleton stabilizing agent phalloidin prevented the hyperpolarizing shift in the half-maximal inactivation potential when co-applied with latrunculin B. Additionally, PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion (a strategy that regulates Kv2.1 inactivation) after cytoskeleton disruption does not regulate further the inactivation of Kv2.1, which suggests that both factors could be regulating the Kv2.1 channel by a common mechanism. In summary, our results suggest a role for the actin-based cytoskeleton in regulating Kv2.1 channels."
"MEF2C"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"The role of genomic variation in differentiation is currently not well understood. Here, the genomic variations were determined with the whole-genome sequencing for three pairs of pluripotent stem cell lines and their corresponding BMP4-induced trophoblast cell lines. We identified ∼3,500 single nucleotide variations and ∼4,500 indels by comparing the genome sequenced data between the stem cell lines and the matched BMP4-induced trophoblast cell lines and annotated them by integrating the epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets. Relatively, introns enrich more variations. We found ∼45% (42 genes) of the differentially expressed genes in trophoblasts that associate genomic variations. Six variations, located at transcription factor binding sites where H3K4me3 and H3K27ac are enriched in both H1 and H1_BMP4, were identified. The epigenetic status around the genomic variations in H1 was similar to that in H1_BMP4. This means that the variation-associated gene's expression change can not be attributed to epigenetic alteration. The genes associated with the six variations were upregulated in differentiation. We inferred that during the differentiation, an increased in the expression level of the MEF2C gene is due to a genomic variation in chromosomes 5: 88179358 A &gt; G, which is at a binding site of TFs KLF16, NR2C2, and ZNF740 to MEF2C. Allele G shows a higher affinity to the TFs in the induced cells. The increased expression of MEF2C leads to an increased expression of TF MEF2C's target genes, subsequently affecting the differentiation. Although genomic variation should not be a dominant factor in differentiation, we believe that genomic variation could indeed play a role in the differentiation from stem cells into trophoblast."	"Intracellular calcium is related to cardiac hypertrophy. The Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and CaM regulate the intracellular calcium content. However, the differences in CaMKII and CaM in cardiac hypertrophy are still conflicting and are worthy of studying as drug targets. Therefore, in this study, we aim to investigate the roles and mechanism of CaM and CaMKII on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in pathological myocardial hypertrophy. The results showed that ISO stimulation caused SD rat heart and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In vivo, the HW/BW, LVW/BW, cross-sectional area, fibrosis ratio and ANP expression were all increased. There were no differences in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel expression in the in vivo model or the in vitro model, but the ISO stimulation induced channel activity, and the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increased. The protein expression levels of CaMKII and p-CaMKII were all increased in the ISO group, but the CaM expression level decreased. AIP inhibited ANP, CaMKII and p-CaMKII expression, and ISO-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increased. AIP also reduced HDAC4, p-HDAC and MEF2C expression. However, CMZ did not play a cardiac hypertrophy reversal role in vitro. In conclusion, we considered that compared with CaM, CaMKII may be a much more important drug target in cardiac hypertrophy reversal."	"Residue Thr1604 in the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation site, and its phosphorylation status maintains the basic activity of the channel. However, the role of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 phosphorylation at Thr1604 in myocardial hypertrophy is incompletely understood. Isoproterenol (ISO) was used to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP) was added as a treatment. Rats in a myocardial hypertrophy development model were subcutaneously injected with ISO for two or three weeks. The heart and left ventricle weights, each of which were normalized to the body weight and cross-sectional area of the myocardial cells, were used to describe the degree of hypertrophy. Protein expression levels were detected by western blotting. CaMKII-induced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (Thr1604) phosphorylation (p-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) was assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. The results showed that CaMKII, HDAC, MEF2 C, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression was increased in the ISO group and downregulated by AIP treatment <i>in vitro</i>. There was no difference in the expression of these proteins between the ISO 2-week group and the ISO 3-week group <i>in vivo</i>. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel expression did not change, but p-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 expression was increased after ISO stimulation and decreased by AIP. In the rat model, p-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 levels and CaMKII activity were much higher in the ISO 3-week group than in the ISO 2-week group. CaMKII-induced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel phosphorylation at residue Thr1604 may be one of the key features of myocardial hypertrophy and disease development.<b>Abbreviations:</b> CaMKII: Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; p-CaMKII: autophosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; CaM: calmodulin; AIP: autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide; ECC: excitation-contraction coupling; ISO: isoproterenol; BW: body weight; HW: heart weight; LVW: left ventricle weight; HDAC: histone deacetylase; p-HDAC: phosphorylated histone deacetylase; MEF2C: myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C; ANP: atrial natriuretic peptide; PKC: protein kinase C."	"Using direct conversion technology, normal adult somatic cells can be routinely switched from their original cell type into specific differentiated cell types by inducing the expression of differentiation-related transcription factors. In this study, normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) are directly converted into cardiomyocyte-like cells by drug and gene delivery using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) nanoparticles (CiCMC-NPs). CMC-based multifunctional nanogels containing specific cardiomyocyte-related genes are designed and fabricated, including <i>GATA4</i>, <i>MEF2C</i>, and <i>TBX5</i> (GMT). However, GMT alone is insufficient, at least in vitro, in human fibroblasts. Hence, to inhibit proliferation and to induce differentiation, 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) is conjugated to the hydroxyl group of CMC in CiCMC-NPs containing GMT; in addition, the CMC is coated with polyethylenimine. It is confirmed that the CiCMC-NPs have nanogel properties, and that they exhibit the characteristic effects of 5-AZA and GMT. When CiCMC-NPs-containing 5-AZA and GMT are introduced into NHDFs, cardiomyocyte differentiation is initiated. In the reprogrammed cells, the mature cardiac-specific markers cardiac troponin I and α-actinin are expressed at twofold to threefold higher levels than in NHDFs. Engineered cells transplanted into live hearts exhibit active pumping ability within 1 day. Histology and immunohistology of heart tissue confirm the presence of transplanted engineered NHDF cells at injection sites."	"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of non-coding RNAs, have been found to act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges and thus play key roles in biological processes and pathogenesis. However, studies regarding circRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain inadequate.By differential expression analysis, 10 candidate circRNAs (6 upregulated and 4 downregulated circRNAs) were chosen. 9 of 10 circRNAs were available on CSCD and their structure showed the binding potential of miRNA. Intersection analysis revealed that miR-145-5p, miR-3127-5p, miR-761, miR-4766-3p, miR-135a-5p, miR-135b-5p, miR-374a-3p and miR-330-3p were 8 miRNAs with the most potential in binding circRNAs. Further expression validation and correlation analysis demonstrated hsa_circ_0001955/miR-145-5p and hsa_circ_0000977/miR-135b-5p axes as key pathways in CRC. Subsequently, target gene prediction, differential expression analysis, intersection analysis and correlation analysis showed that CDK6, MMP12 and RAB3IP were the three potential downstream targets of hsa_circ_0001955/miR-145-5p axis and FOXO1, MBNL1, MEF2C, RECK, PPM1E, TTLL7 and PCP4L1 were the seven potential downstream targets of hsa_circ_0000977/miR-135b-5p axis in CRC. Finally, we also confirmed that expression of hsa_circ_0001955 or hsa_circ_0000977 was significantly positively correlated with their individual targets in CRC.In the present work, we constructed a potential hsa_circ_0001955/hsa_circ_0000977-mediated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in CRC by a series of <i>in silico</i> analysis and experimental validation.Whole-transcriptome microarrays from CRC and matched normal samples were obtained from GEO. The structure of circRNA was identified by CSCD. starBase and miRNet were successively used to predict miRNA of circRNA and target gene of miRNA. Expression correlation between RNA-RNA interactions was assessed using GEO and TCGA data. Finally, a potential circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was established based on competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis."	"Dechlorane Plus (DP) is a widely used chlorinated flame retardant, which has been extensively detected in the environment. Although DP content in the surface water is low, it can pose a continuous exposure risk to aquatic organisms due to its strong bioaccumulation. Considering that the related studies on the toxicity mechanism of DP exposure are limited, the effect of DP on carp embryo development was evaluated. In the present work, carp embryos were exposed to different concentrations (0, 30, 60, and 120 μg/L) of DP at 3 h post-fertilization (hpf). The expression levels of neural and skeletal development-associated genes, such as sox2, sox19a, Mef2c and BMP4, were detected with quantitative PCR, and the changes in different developmental toxicity endpoints were observed. Our results demonstrated that the expression levels of sox2, sox19a, Mef2c and BMP4 were significantly altered and several developmental abnormalities were found in DP-exposed carp embryos, such as DNA damage, increased mortality rate, delayed hatching time, reduced hatching rate, decreased body length, and increased morphological deformities. In addition, the activities of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde were remarkably higher in 60 and 120 μg/L DP exposure groups than in control group. These results suggest that DP can exhibit a unique modes of action, which lead to aberration occurrence in the early development stage of common carps, which may be related to some gene damage and oxidative stress. Besides, the parameters evaluated here can be used as tools to access the environmental risk for biota and humans exposed to DP."	"Guiding progenitor cell development between chondral versus endochondral pathways is still an unachieved task of cartilage neogenesis, and human mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) chondrogenesis is considered as a valuable model to better understand hypertrophic development of chondrocytes. Transcription factors Runx2, Runx3, and Mef2c play prominent roles for chondrocyte hypertrophy during mouse development, but little is known on the importance of these key fate-determining factors for endochondral development of human MPCs. The aim of this study was to unravel the regulation of RUNX2, RUNX3, and MEF2C during MPC chondrogenesis, the pathways driving their expression, and the downstream hypertrophic targets affected by their regulation. <i>RUNX2</i>, <i>RUNX3</i>, and <i>MEF2C</i> gene expression was differentially regulated during chondrogenesis of MPCs, but remained low and unregulated when non-hypertrophic articular chondrocytes were differentiated under the same conditions. RUNX3 and MEF2C mRNA and protein levels rose in parallel to hypertrophic marker upregulation, but surprisingly, <i>RUNX2</i> gene expression changed only by trend and RUNX2 protein remained undetectable. While <i>RUNX3</i> expression was driven by TGF-β and BMP signaling, <i>MEF2C</i> responded to WNT-, BMP-, and Hedgehog-pathway inhibition. <i>MEF2C</i> but not <i>RUNX3</i> levels correlated significantly with <i>COL10A1</i>, <i>IHH</i>, and <i>IBSP</i> gene expression when hypertrophy was attenuated. <i>IBSP</i> was a downstream target of RUNX3 and MEF2C but not RUNX2 in SAOS-2 cells, underlining the capacity of RUNX3 and MEF2C to stimulate osteogenic marker expression in human cells. Conclusively, RUNX3 and MEF2C appeared more important than RUNX2 for human endochondral MPC chondrogenesis. Pathways altering the speed of chondrogenesis (FGF, TGF-β, BMP) affected RUNX2 or RUNX3, while pathways changing hypertrophy (WNT, PTHrP/HH) regulated mainly MEF2C. Taken together, reduction of MEF2C levels is a new goal to shift human cartilage neogenesis toward the chondral pathway."	"Promoter methylation‑associated silencing of cancer‑associated microRNAs (miRNAs) is a common epigenetic mechanism during tumorigenesis in various types of human cancer. However, this has not been comprehensively examined in endometrial carcinoma (EC). In the present study, an miRNA microarray consisting of 1,347 common human miRNAs was used to select potential tumor suppressive miRNAs that were hyper‑methylated in EC. This led to the identification of miR‑638, miR‑210 and miR‑3665. The methylation status of miR‑638 was examined by bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction and miR‑638 expression was measured by TaqMan miRNA assays. EC cell lines transfected with vectors overexpressing miR‑638, its target gene myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) or both, were constructed. Dual‑luciferase reporter assays, a xenograft mouse model and rescue experiments were designed to study miR‑638 and its target gene MEF2C. The results indicated that the promoter region of miR‑638 was highly methylated and the expression of miR‑638 was significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues from 42 patients with EC who underwent surgical resection. Additionally, a low expression of miR‑638 was significantly associated with advanced Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and was demonstrated to indicate shorter disease‑free survival. Functional studies indicated that the overexpression of miR‑638 in EC cell lines inhibited in vitro tumor progression and in vivo tumorigenicity. MEF2C was verified as a direct target of miR‑638 and was demonstrated to mediate the tumor‑suppressive function of miR‑638 in EC."	"The incidence of CHD is the highest among birth defects and is increasing year to year. CHD seriously harms the health of infants and young children and presents a large economic burden to families and society. The pathogenesis of CHD and preventive measures are the focus of current research. Our research aimed to explore the intervention effect of folic acid on heart abnormalities resulting from sodium arsenic (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) exposure during the periconception period.Sixty 35-day-old female SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups with 12 rats in each group. Group A was the control group. The rats were given distilled water and ordinary chow. The rats in group B were given distilled water containing 75 mg/L NaAsO<sub>2</sub> and ordinary chow. The rats in groups C, D, and E were given distilled water containing 75 mg/L NaAsO<sub>2</sub> and chow containing 0.53 mg/kg, 5.3 mg/kg, and 10.6 mg/kg folic acid, respectively. The general condition of the embryos and the histopathology of the embryonic hearts were examined. The acetylation levels of histone H3K9 in heart tissues and the expression levels of Mef2C (which is related to heart development) were observed.The embryo weight and placental weight of groups B-E were significantly lower than those of group A (P &lt; 0.05). The heart malformation rate of the fetal rats in groups B-E was significantly higher than that of the fetal rats in group A (P &lt; 0.05). We found that the level of H3K9 acetylation in fetal rat cardiomyocytes in groups B-E was significantly higher than that in group A (P &lt; 0.05) and that the level of H3K9 acetylation in groups C-E was lower than that in group B (P &lt; 0.05). The mRNA level of Mef2C in fetal rat cardiomyocytes in group B-E was significantly higher than that in group A (P &lt; 0.05), and the mRNA level of Mef2C in groups C-E was significantly lower than that in group B (P &lt; 0.05).Supplementation with folic acid during the periconception period can interfere with the toxic effects of arsenic on the heart. The mechanism may be that lowering the acetylation levels of histone H3K9 in heart tissues leads to decreased expression levels of Mef2C, which may play a protective role in heart development in fetal rats."	"Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) is the main transcriptional co-activator of Notch signaling pathway. It plays essential roles in several pathways including MEF2C, p53, Nf-кB and Wnt/β-catenin. TWIST1 is known as a regulator of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is considered as a primary step in promotion of tumor cell metastasis. Since concomitant expression of these genes was observed in tumors, our aim in this study was to elucidate the linkage between MAML1 and TWIST1 co-overexpression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).While MAML1 silencing significantly down-regulated TWIST1, its ectopic expression up-regulated TWIST1 expression in both mRNA and protein levels in KYSE-30 cells. Expression of mesenchymal markers was increased significantly after MAML1 and TWIST1 ectopic expression, while epithelial markers expression was significantly decreased after silencing of both genes. Concomitant protein expression of MAML1 and TWIST1 was significantly observed in ESCC patients. Enforced expression of TWIST1 had no impact on MAML1 gene expression in KYSE-30 cells.The results clearly suggest transcriptional regulation of TWIST1 by MAML1 transcription factor in ESCC cells KYSE-30. Since TWIST1 is known as an EMT inducing marker, our results may revealed the mastermind behind TWIST1 function and introduced MAML1 as an upstream master regulator of TWIST1 and EMT in KYSE-30 cells."	"Alcohol use and aging are risk factors for falls requiring immobilization and leading to skeletal muscle atrophy. Skeletal muscle regeneration is integral to post-immobilization recovery. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of alcohol and ovarian hormone loss on the expression of genes implicated in muscle regeneration. Three-month-old female rats received an ovariectomy or a sham surgery, consumed an alcohol-containing or control diet for 10 weeks, were subjected to unilateral hind limb immobilization for seven days, and finally were allowed a three (3d)- or 14 (14d)-day recovery. Immobilization decreased the quadriceps weight at 3d and 14d, and alcohol decreased the quadriceps weight at 14d in the nonimmobilized hind limb (NI). At 3d, alcohol decreased gene expression of myoblast determination protein (MyoD) in the immobilized hind limb (IMM) and myocyte enhancer factor (Mef)2C and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α in NI, and ovariectomy increased MyoD and decreased TNFα expression in NI. At 14d, alcohol increased the gene expression of Mef2C, MyoD, TNFα, and transforming growth factor (TFG)β in IMM and decreased monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)1 expression in NI; ovariectomy increased TNFα expression in NI, and alcohol and ovariectomy together increased Mef2C expression in NI. Despite increased TGFβ expression, there was no concomitant alcohol-mediated increase in collagen in IMM at 14d. Overall, these data indicate that alcohol dysregulated the post-immobilization alteration in the expression of genes implicated in regeneration. Whether alcohol-mediated molecular changes correspond with post-immobilization functional alterations remains to be determined."	"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) results from deregulation of a number of genes via multiple genomic mechanisms. We designed a comprehensive fluorescence in situ hybridization (CI-FISH) assay that consists of genomic probes to simultaneously investigate oncogenes and oncosuppressors recurrently involved in chromosome rearrangements in T-ALL, which was applied to 338 T-ALL cases. CI-FISH provided genetic classification into one of the well-defined genetic subgroups (ie, TAL/LMO, HOXA, TLX3, TLX1, NKX2-1/2-2, or MEF2C) in 80% of cases. Two patients with translocations of the LMO3 transcription factor were identified, suggesting that LMO3 activation may serve as an alternative to LMO1/LMO2 activation in the pathogenesis of this disease. Moreover, intrachromosomal rearrangements that involved the 10q24 locus were found as a new mechanism of TLX1 activation. An unequal distribution of cooperating genetic defects was found among the six genetic subgroups. Of interest, deletions that targeted TCF7 or TP53 were exclusively found in HOXA T-ALL, LEF1 defects were prevalent in NKX2-1 rearranged patients, CASP8AP2 and PTEN alterations were significantly enriched in TAL/LMO leukemias, and PTPN2 and NUP214-ABL1 abnormalities occurred in TLX1/TLX3. This work convincingly shows that CI-FISH is a powerful tool to define genetic heterogeneity of T-ALL, which may be applied as a rapid and accurate diagnostic test."	"Skeletal muscle represents the largest pool of body zinc, however, little is known about muscle zinc homeostasis or muscle-specific zinc functions. Zip14 (Slc39a14) was the most highly expressed zinc transporter in skeletal muscle of mice in response to LPS-induced inflammation. We compared metabolic parameters of skeletal muscle from global Zip14 knockout (KO) and wild-type mice (WT). At basal steady state Zip14 KO mice exhibited a phenotype that included muscle wasting and metabolic endotoxemia. Microarray and qPCR analysis of gastrocnemius muscle RNA revealed that ablation of Zip14 produced increased muscle p-Mef2c, Hspb7 and miR-675-5p expression and increased p38 activation. ChIP assays showed enhanced binding of NF-[Formula: see text] to the Mef2c promoter. In contrast, LPS-induced systemic inflammation enhanced Zip14-dependent zinc uptake by muscle, increased expression of Atrogin1 and MuRF1 and markedly reduced MyoD. These signatures of muscle atrophy and cachexia were not influenced by Zip14 ablation, however. LPS-induced miR-675-3p and -5p expression was Zip14-dependent. Collectively, these results with an integrative model are consistent with a Zip14 function in skeletal muscle at steady state that supports myogenesis through suppression of metabolic endotoxemia and that Zip14 ablation coincides with sustained activity of phosphorylated components of signaling pathways including p-Mef2c, which causes Hspb7-dependent muscle wasting."	"Skeletal muscle wasting is a devastating consequence of cancer that contributes to increased complications and poor survival, but is not well understood at the molecular level. Herein, we investigated the role of Myocilin (Myoc), a skeletal muscle hypertrophy-promoting protein that we showed is downregulated in multiple mouse models of cancer cachexia. Loss of Myoc alone was sufficient to induce phenotypes identified in mouse models of cancer cachexia, including muscle fiber atrophy, sarcolemmal fragility, and impaired muscle regeneration. By 18 months of age, mice deficient in Myoc showed significant skeletal muscle remodeling, characterized by increased fat and collagen deposition compared with wild-type mice, thus also supporting Myoc as a regulator of muscle quality. In cancer cachexia models, maintaining skeletal muscle expression of Myoc significantly attenuated muscle loss, while mice lacking Myoc showed enhanced muscle wasting. Furthermore, we identified the Myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (MEF2C) transcription factor as a key upstream activator of Myoc whose gain-of-function significantly deterred cancer-induced muscle wasting and dysfunction in a preclinical model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Finally, compared with noncancer control patients, MYOC was significantly reduced in skeletal muscle of patients with PDAC defined as cachectic and correlated with MEF2c. These data therefore identify disruptions in MEF2c-dependent transcription of Myoc as a novel mechanism of cancer-associated muscle wasting that is similarly disrupted in muscle of patients with cachectic cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This work identifies a novel transcriptional mechanism that mediates skeletal muscle wasting in murine models of cancer cachexia that is disrupted in skeletal muscle of patients with cancer exhibiting cachexia."	"Isoflurane postconditioning alleviates cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury (CIRI), but the underlying mechanism has not been fully clarified. We previously demonstrated that the transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1)/Smads signaling pathway is involved in the neuroprotective effect of isoflurane postconditioning. TGF-β3 has a highly homologous sequence relative to that of TGF-β1. In this study, we explored the roles of the TGF-β3/Smad3 signaling pathway and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) in neuroprotection induced by isoflurane postconditioning. A CIRI rat model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1.5 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Isoflurane postconditioning led to lower infarct volumes and neurologic deficit scores, more surviving neurons, and less damaged and apoptotic neurons as compared with those of CIRI rats. Moreover, isoflurane postconditioning upregulated the expressions of TGF-β3, p-Smad3, and MEF2C. However, the neuroprotective effect was reversed by pirfenidone, a TGF-β3/Smad3 signaling pathway inhibitor. Also, pirfenidone treatment downregulated the expression of MEF2C. These results indicate that the TGF-β3/Smad3 signaling pathway contributes to the neuroprotection of isoflurane postconditioning after CIRI and is possibly related to MEF2C."	"Multipotent adult mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) could represent an elegant source for the generation of patient-specific cardiomyocytes needed for regenerative medicine, cardiovascular research, and pharmacological studies. However, the differentiation of adult MSC into a cardiac lineage is challenging compared to embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. Here we used non-integrative methods, including microRNA and mRNA, for cardiac reprogramming of adult MSC derived from bone marrow, dental follicle, and adipose tissue. We found that MSC derived from adipose tissue can partly be reprogrammed into the cardiac lineage by transient overexpression of GATA4, TBX5, MEF2C, and MESP1, while cells isolated from bone marrow, and dental follicle exhibit only weak reprogramming efficiency. qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis revealed activation of a cardiac-specific gene program and up-regulation of genes known to promote cardiac development. Although we did not observe the formation of fully mature cardiomyocytes, our data suggests that adult MSC have the capability to acquire a cardiac-like phenotype when treated with mRNA coding for transcription factors that regulate heart development. Yet, further optimization of the reprogramming process is mandatory to increase the reprogramming efficiency."	"Overexpression of exogenous lineage-determining factors succeeds in directly reprogramming fibroblasts to various cell types. Several studies have reported reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene activation is a potential approach for cellular reprogramming due to its high precision and multiplexing capacity. Here we show lineage reprogramming to iCPCs through a dead Cas9 (dCas9)-based transcription activation system. Targeted and robust activation of endogenous cardiac factors, including GATA4, HAND2, MEF2C and TBX5 (G, H, M and T; GHMT), can reprogram human fibroblasts toward iCPCs. The iCPCs show potentials to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. Addition of MEIS1 to GHMT induces cell cycle arrest in G2/M and facilitates cardiac reprogramming. Lineage reprogramming of human fibroblasts into iCPCs provides a promising cellular resource for disease modeling, drug discovery and individualized cardiac cell therapy."	"Photoreceptor loss is a leading cause of blindness, but mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration are not well understood. Treatment strategies would benefit from improved understanding of gene-expression patterns directing photoreceptor development, as many genes are implicated in both development and degeneration. Neural retina leucine zipper (NRL) is critical for rod photoreceptor genesis and degeneration, with NRL mutations known to cause enhanced S-cone syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa. While murine Nrl loss has been characterized, studies of human NRL can identify important insights for human retinal development and disease. We utilized iPSC organoid models of retinal development to molecularly define developmental alterations in a human model of NRL loss. Consistent with the function of NRL in rod fate specification, human retinal organoids lacking NRL develop S-opsin dominant photoreceptor populations. We report generation of two distinct S-opsin expressing populations in NRL null retinal organoids and identify MEF2C as a candidate regulator of cone development."	"Although many advances have been made in the pathogenesis of epilepsy recently, the pathological mechanisms of epilepsy are still largely unknown. Exploring the pathological mechanisms and developing novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy are urgently needed. A SD rat model of epilepsy was established with lithium chloride-pilocarpine. Astrocytes were isolated, cultured from 8 to 12 week rats and identified by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemical staining was used for MEF2C and NF-κB in paraffin-embedded sections. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to analyze gene expression. ELISA was used to analyze the concentration of IL-6, TNF-α and Cox-2. Cells were transfected with pcDNA-MEFC2, sh-MEFC2, pcDNA-UCA1, sh-UCA1, miR-203 mimic or miR-203 inhibitor. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Dual luciferase assay was used to determine the direct interaction of lncRNA UCA1/miR-203 and miR-203/MEF2C. MEF2C was down-regulated and inhibited NF-κB expression and the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in epilepsy. LncRNA UCA1 was also down-regulated in epilepsy. LncRNA UCA1 over-expression increased the expression of MEF2C and its knock-down decreased MEF2C expression. Luciferase activity showed lncRNA UCA1 directly targeted miR-203 and miR-203 directly targeted MEF2C. MiR-203 suppressed the expression of MEF2C, and promoted NF-κB, phosphorylated IκB/IKK and inflammatory effectors, which was reversed by MEF2C knock-down. Moreover, lncRNA UCA1 could increase the expression of MEF2C to inhibit NF-κB, phosphorylated IκB/IKK and inflammatory effectors, which was also reversed by miR-203 mimic transfection. LncRNA UCA1 inhibited the inflammation via regulating miR-203 mediated regulation of MEF2C/NF-κB signaling in epilepsy. Our investigation elucidated novel pathological mechanisms and provided potential therapeutic targets for epilepsy."	"MicroRNAs (miRs) appear to be major, yet poorly understood players in regulatory networks guiding cardiogenesis. We sought to identify miRs with unknown functions during cardiogenesis analyzing the miR-profile of multipotent <i>Nkx2.5</i> enhancer cardiac progenitor cells (NkxCE-CPCs). Besides well-known candidates such as miR-1, we found about 40 miRs that were highly enriched in NkxCE-CPCs, four of which were chosen for further analysis. Knockdown in zebrafish revealed that only miR-128a affected cardiac development and function robustly. For a detailed analysis, loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were performed during in vitro differentiations of transgenic murine pluripotent stem cells. MiR-128a knockdown (1) increased <i>Isl1</i>, <i>Sfrp5</i>, and <i>Hcn4</i> (cardiac transcription factors) but reduced <i>Irx4</i> at the onset of cardiogenesis, (2) upregulated <i>Isl1</i>-positive CPCs, whereas NkxCE-positive CPCs were downregulated, and (3) increased the expression of the ventricular cardiomyocyte marker <i>Myl2</i> accompanied by a reduced beating frequency of early cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of miR-128a (4) diminished the expression of <i>Isl1</i>, <i>Sfrp5</i>, <i>Nkx2.5</i>, and <i>Mef2c</i>, but increased <i>Irx4</i>, (5) enhanced NkxCE-positive CPCs, and (6) favored nodal-like cardiomyocytes (<i>Tnnt2</i><sup>+</sup>, <i>Myh6</i><sup>+</sup>, <i>Shox2</i><sup>+</sup>) accompanied by increased beating frequencies. In summary, we demonstrated that miR-128a plays a so-far unknown role in early heart development by affecting the timing of CPC differentiation into various cardiomyocyte subtypes."
"NRXN1"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Neuroimaging studies of psychiatric illness have revealed a broad spectrum of structural and functional perturbations that have been attributed in part to the complex genetic heterogeneity underpinning these disorders. These perturbations have been identified in both preclinical genetic models and in patients when compared to control populations, but recent work has also demonstrated strong evidence for genetic, molecular, and structural convergence of several psychiatric diseases. We explored potential similarities in neural microstructure in preclinical genetic models of ASD (Fmr1, Nrxn1, Pten) and schizophrenia (Disc1 svΔ2) and in age- and sex-matched control animals with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). Our findings demonstrate a convergence in brain microstructure across these four genetic models with both tract-based and region-of-interest based analyses, which continues to buttress an emerging understanding of converging neural microstructure in psychiatric disease."	"Rare heterozygous deletions in the neurexin 1 (NRXN1) gene robustly increase an individual's risk of developing neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the molecular bases by which different mutations result in different clinical presentations, with variable penetrance, are unknown. To better understand the molecular and cellular consequences of heterozygous NRXN1 mutations, Flaherty and colleagues studied how patient mutations influence the NRXN1 isoform repertoire and neuronal phenotypes using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Advancing from disease association to mechanistic insights, the authors provide insight into how patient mutations might impinge on neuronal function. This research highlights the value of iPS cells for elucidating otherwise elusive links between molecular and neuronal function. In addition, they provide further evidence of the importance of alternative splicing in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases."	"<b>Objective:</b> Schizophrenia is a complicated mental disorder that affects about 1% of the world's population. It is a complex disease and is approximately 80% inherited. One of the candidate genes in schizophrenia is transcription factor 4 (TCF4), which is positioned on chromosome 18 and is a transcription factor that plays a role in the transcription of Neurexin 1(NRXN1) gene, which is one of the candidate genes for developing schizophrenia. This case-control study aimed to investigate the correlation of TCF4 rs13381800 and NRXN1 rs17039988 polymorphisms with the risk of schizophrenia in a sample of Iranian patients with schizophrenia. <b>Method</b><b>:</b> A total of 200 individuals were included in this study: 100 patients with schizophrenia (65 males and 35 females), with the mean age of 40.80 ± 11.298 years, and 100 as a control group (63 males and 37 females), with the mean age 32.92 ± 7.391 years. Allele specific polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) were done, respectively, for genotyping of rs13381800 (T/C) and rs17039988 (A/C) polymorphisms. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that the frequency of C / C genotype in rs13381800 in patients' group was 9%, while it was 13% in the control group. Also, the frequency of C / C genotype in rs17039988 was 9% in patients and 7% in control groups. Statistical analysis of polymorphisms showed no correlation between patients and controls in rs13381800 (OR = 1.51; CI = 95%; P = 0.366) and rs17039988 (OR = 0.76; CI = 95%; P = 0.602). <b>Conclusion:</b> No significant difference was found between rs13381800 and rs17039988 genotypes between patients and control groups in terms of gender, age and education in the patients group. Our study suggests that there was no correlation between desired polymorphisms with schizophrenia in the studied population."	"Intragenic <i>NRXN1</i> deletions are susceptibility variants for neurodevelopmental disorders; however, their clinical interpretation is often unclear. Therefore, a literature study and an analysis of 43 previously unpublished deletions are provided.The literature cohort covered 629 heterozygous <i>NRXN1</i> deletions: 148 in controls, 341 in probands and 140 in carrier relatives, and was used for clinical hypothesis testing. Exact breakpoint determination was performed for 43 in-house deletions.The prevalence of exonic <i>NRXN1</i> deletions in controls was ~1/3000 as compared with ~1/800 in patients with neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders. The differential distribution of deletions across the gene between controls and probands allowed to distinguish distinct areas within the gene. Exon 6-24 deletions appeared only twice in over 100000 control individuals, had an estimated penetrance for neurodevelopmental disorders of 32.43%, a <i>de novo</i> rate of 50% and segregated mainly with intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia. In contrast, exon 1-5 deletions appeared in 20 control individuals, had an estimated penetrance of 12.59%, a <i>de novo</i> rate of 32.5% and were reported with a broad range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Exact breakpoint determination revealed six recurrent intron 5 deletions.Exon 6-24 deletions have a high penetrance and are mainly associated with ID and schizophrenia. In contrast, the actual contribution of exon 1-5 deletions to a neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorder in an individual patient and family remains very difficult to assess. To enhance the clinical interpretation, this study provides practical considerations for counselling and an interactive table for comparing a deletion of interest with the available literature data."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a high co-morbidity of epilepsy and associated with hundreds of rare risk factors. <i>NRXN1</i> deletion is among the commonest rare genetic factors shared by ASD, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and developmental delay. However, how <i>NRXN1</i> deletions lead to different clinical symptoms is unknown. Patient-derived cells are essential to investigate the functional consequences of <i>NRXN1</i> lesions to human neurons in different diseases.Skin biopsies were donated by five healthy donors and three ASD patients carrying <i>NRXN1α</i><sup>                        <i>+/-</i>                    </sup> deletions. Seven control and six <i>NRXN1α</i><sup>                        <i>+/-</i>                    </sup> iPSC lines were derived and differentiated into day 100 cortical excitatory neurons using dual SMAD inhibition. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging was performed using Fluo4-AM, and the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were compared between two groups of neurons. Transcriptome analysis was carried out to undercover molecular pathways associated with <i>NRXN1α</i><sup>                        <i>+/-</i>                    </sup> neurons.<i>NRXN1α</i><sup>                        <i>+/-</i>                    </sup> neurons were found to display altered calcium dynamics, with significantly increased frequency, duration, and amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Whole genome RNA sequencing also revealed altered ion transport and transporter activity, with upregulated voltage-gated calcium channels as one of the most significant pathways in <i>NRXN1α</i><sup>                        <i>+/-</i>                    </sup> neurons identified by STRING and GSEA analyses.This is the first report to show that human <i>NRXN1α</i><sup>                        <i>+/-</i>                    </sup> neurons derived from ASD patients' iPSCs present novel phenotypes of upregulated VGCCs and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which may facilitate the development of drug screening assays for the treatment of ASD."	"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder consistently show a male bias in prevalence, but it remains unclear why males and females are affected with different frequency. While many behavioral studies of transgenic NDD models have focused only on males, the requirement by the National Institutes of Health to consider sex as a biological variable has promoted the comparison of male and female performance in wild-type and mutant animals. Here, we review examples of rodent models of NDDs in which sex-specific deficits were identified in molecular, physiological, and/or behavioral responses, showing sex differences in susceptibility to disruption of genes mutated in NDDs. Haploinsufficiency in genes involved in mechanisms such as synaptic function (GABRB3 and NRXN1), chromatin remodeling (CHD8, EMHT1, and ADNP), and intracellular signaling (CC2D1A and ERK1) lead to more severe behavioral outcomes in males. However, in the absence of behavioral deficits, females can still present with cellular and electrophysiological changes that could be due to compensatory mechanisms or differential allocation of molecular and cellular functions in the two sexes. By contrasting these findings with mouse models where females are more severely affected (MTHFR and AMBRA1), we propose a framework to approach the study of sex-specific deficits possibly leading to sex bias in NDDs."	"<b>Aim:</b> To identify methylation-associated genes in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). <b>Materials &amp; methods:</b> Genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were determined and further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas data and Chinese CRC patients, respectively. Gene overexpression and knockdown cells were constructed to investigate their biological roles in CRC. <b>Results:</b> After validations, hypermethylation of eight genes were found to be correlated with their reduced transcription, and hypomethyaltion of three genes were associated with their upregulation. <i>CADM3</i>, <i>CNRIP1</i>, <i>GRHL2</i>, <i>GRIA4</i>, <i>GSTM2</i> and <i>NRXN1</i> were associated with the overall survival of CRC patients. <i>CNRIP1</i> and <i>GSTM2</i> were mainly responsible for the proliferation in CRC cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> A total of 11 genes may be promising biomarkers for CRC."	"2p16.3 deletions, involving heterozygous NEUREXIN1 (NRXN1) deletion, dramatically increase the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. We have little understanding of how NRXN1 heterozygosity increases the risk of developing these disorders, particularly in terms of the impact on brain and neurotransmitter system function and brain network connectivity. Thus, here we characterize cerebral metabolism and functional brain network connectivity in Nrxn1α heterozygous mice (Nrxn1α+/- mice), and assess the impact of ketamine and dextro-amphetamine on cerebral metabolism in these animals. We show that heterozygous Nrxn1α deletion alters cerebral metabolism in neural systems implicated in autism and schizophrenia including the thalamus, mesolimbic system, and select cortical regions. Nrxn1α heterozygosity also reduces the efficiency of functional brain networks, through lost thalamic &quot;rich club&quot; and prefrontal cortex (PFC) hub connectivity and through reduced thalamic-PFC and thalamic &quot;rich club&quot; regional interconnectivity. Subanesthetic ketamine administration normalizes the thalamic hypermetabolism and partially normalizes thalamic disconnectivity present in Nrxn1α+/- mice, while cerebral metabolic responses to dextro-amphetamine are unaltered. The data provide new insight into the systems-level impact of heterozygous Nrxn1α deletion and how this increases the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders. The data also suggest that the thalamic dysfunction induced by heterozygous Nrxn1α deletion may be NMDA receptor-dependent."	"Mounting evidence has demonstrated that a lot of miRNAs are overexpressed or downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and play a crucial role in tumorigenesis, invasion, and migration. The aim of our study was to screen new biomarkers related to CRC prognosis by bioinformatics analysis. By using the R language edgeR package for the differential analysis and standardization of miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 502 differentially expressed miRNAs (343 up-regulated, 159 down-regulated) were screened based on the cut-off criteria of <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 and |log2FC|&gt;1, then all the patients (421) with differentially expressed miRNAs and complete survival time, status were then randomly divided into train group (212) and the test group (209). Eight miRNAs with <i>p</i> &lt; 0.005 were revealed in univariate cox regression analysis of train group, then stepwise multivariate cox regression was applied for constituting a five-miRNA (hsa-miR-5091, hsa-miR-10b-3p, hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-187-3p, hsa-miR-32-5p) signature prognostic biomarkers with obviously different overall survival. Test group and entire group shown the same results utilizing the same prescient miRNA signature. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for predicting 5 years survival in train group, test group, and whole cohort were 0.79, 0.679, and 0.744, respectively, which demonstrated better predictive power of prognostic model. Furthermore, Univariate cox regression and multivariate cox regression considering other clinical factors displayed that the five-miRNA signature could serve as an independent prognostic factor. In order to predict the potential biological functions of five-miRNA signature, target genes of these five miRNAs were analyzed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The top 10 hub genes (ESR1, ADCY9, MEF2C, NRXN1, ADCY5, FGF2, KITLG, GATA1, GRIA1, KAT2B) of target genes in protein protein interaction (PPI) network were screened by string database and Cytoscape 3.6.1 (plug-in cytoHubba). In addition, 19 of target genes were associated with survival prognosis. Taken together, the current study showed the model of five-miRNA signature could efficiently function as a novel and independent prognosis biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC patients."	"NRXN1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, and non-recurrent heterozygous deletions in NRXN1 are strongly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. We establish that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons well represent the diversity of NRXN1α alternative splicing observed in the human brain, cataloguing 123 high-confidence in-frame human NRXN1α isoforms. Patient-derived NRXN1<sup>+/-</sup> hiPSC-neurons show a greater than twofold reduction in half of the wild-type NRXN1α isoforms and express dozens of novel isoforms from the mutant allele. Reduced neuronal activity in patient-derived NRXN1<sup>+/-</sup> hiPSC-neurons is ameliorated by overexpression of individual control isoforms in a genotype-dependent manner, whereas individual mutant isoforms decrease neuronal activity levels in control hiPSC-neurons. In a genotype-dependent manner, the phenotypic impact of patient-specific NRXN1<sup>+/-</sup> mutations can occur through a reduction in wild-type NRXN1α isoform levels as well as the presence of mutant NRXN1α isoforms."	"NRXN1 copy number variation is a rare genetic factor commonly shared among autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, intellectual disability, epilepsy and developmental delay. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are essential for disease modeling and drug discovery, but familial cases are particularly rare. We report here the derivation of familial iPSC lines from two controls and three ASD patients carrying NRXN1α<sup>+/-</sup>, using a non-integrating Sendai viral kit. The genotype and karyotype of the resulting iPSCs were validated by whole genome SNP array. All iPSC lines expressed comparable levels of pluripotency markers and could be differentiated into three germ layers."	"Genetic mutations are the major pathogenic factor of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In recent years, more and more ASD risk genes have been revealed, among which there are a group of transcriptional regulators. Considering the similarity of the core clinical phenotypes, it is possible that these different factors may regulate the expression levels of certain key targets. Identification of these targets could facilitate the understanding of the etiology and developing of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Therefore, we performed integrated transcriptome analyses of RNA-Seq and microarray data in multiple ASD mouse models and identified a number of common downstream genes in various brain regions, many of which are related to the structure and function of the synapse components or drug addiction. We then established protein-protein interaction networks of the overlapped targets and isolated the hub genes by 11 algorithms based on the topological structure of the networks, including Sdc4, Vegfa, and Cp in the Cortex-Adult subgroup, Gria1 in the Cortex-Juvenile subgroup, and Kdr, S1pr1, Ubc, Grm2, Grin2b, Nrxn1, Pdyn, Grin3a, Itgam, Grin2a, Gabra2, and Camk4 in the Hippocampus-Adult subgroup, many of which have been associated with ASD in previous studies. Finally, we cross compared our results with human brain transcriptional data sets and verified several key candidates, which may play important role in the pathology process of ASD, including SDC4, CP, S1PR1, UBC, PDYN, GRIN2A, GABRA2, and CAMK4. In summary, by integrated bioinformatics analysis, we have identified a series of potentially important molecules for future ASD research. Autism Res 2020, 13: 352-368. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Abnormal transcriptional regulation accounts for a significant portion of Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this study, we performed transcriptome analyses of mouse models to identify common downstream targets of transcriptional regulators involved in ASD. We identified several recurrent target genes that are close related to the common pathological process of ASD, including SDC4, CP, S1PR1, UBC, PDYN, GRM2, NRXN1, GRIN3A, ITGAM, GRIN2A, GABRA2, and CAMK4. These results provide potentially important targets for understanding the molecular mechanism of ASD."	"The pre- and postsynaptic membranes comprising the synaptic junction differ in protein composition. The membrane trafficking mechanisms by which neurons control surface polarization of synaptic receptors remain poorly understood. The sorting receptor Sortilin-related CNS expressed 1 (SorCS1) is a critical regulator of trafficking of neuronal receptors, including the presynaptic adhesion molecule neurexin (Nrxn), an essential synaptic organizer. Here, we show that SorCS1 maintains a balance between axonal and dendritic Nrxn surface levels in the same neuron. Newly synthesized Nrxn1α traffics to the dendritic surface, where it is endocytosed. Endosomal SorCS1 interacts with the Rab11 GTPase effector Rab11 family-interacting protein 5 (Rab11FIP5)/Rab11 interacting protein (Rip11) to facilitate the transition of internalized Nrxn1α from early to recycling endosomes and bias Nrxn1α surface polarization towards the axon. In the absence of SorCS1, Nrxn1α accumulates in early endosomes and mispolarizes to the dendritic surface, impairing presynaptic differentiation and function. Thus, SorCS1-mediated sorting in dendritic endosomes controls Nrxn axonal surface polarization required for proper synapse development and function."	"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable common childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Some rare copy number variations (CNVs) affect multiple neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia and ADHD. The aim of this study is to determine to what extent ADHD shares high risk CNV alleles with schizophrenia and ASD. We compiled 19 neuropsychiatric CNVs and test 14, with sufficient power, for association with ADHD in Icelandic and Norwegian samples. Eight associate with ADHD; deletions at 2p16.3 (NRXN1), 15q11.2, 15q13.3 (BP4 &amp; BP4.5-BP5) and 22q11.21, and duplications at 1q21.1 distal, 16p11.2 proximal, 16p13.11 and 22q11.21. Six of the CNVs have not been associated with ADHD before. As a group, the 19 CNVs associate with ADHD (OR = 2.43, P = 1.6 × 10<sup>-21</sup>), even when comorbid ASD and schizophrenia are excluded from the sample. These results highlight the pleiotropic effect of the neuropsychiatric CNVs and add evidence for ADHD, ASD and schizophrenia being related neurodevelopmental disorders rather than distinct entities."	"Copy number variations (CNVs) are implicated across many neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and contribute to their shared genetic etiology. Multiple studies have attempted to identify shared etiology among NDDs, but this is the first genome-wide CNV analysis across autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) at once. Using microarray (Affymetrix CytoScan HD), we genotyped 2,691 subjects diagnosed with an NDD (204 SCZ, 1,838 ASD, 427 ADHD and 222 OCD) and 1,769 family members, mainly parents. We identified rare CNVs, defined as those found in &lt;0.1% of 10,851 population control samples. We found clinically relevant CNVs (broadly defined) in 284 (10.5%) of total subjects, including 22 (10.8%) among subjects with SCZ, 209 (11.4%) with ASD, 40 (9.4%) with ADHD, and 13 (5.6%) with OCD. Among all NDD subjects, we identified 17 (0.63%) with aneuploidies and 115 (4.3%) with known genomic disorder variants. We searched further for genes impacted by different CNVs in multiple disorders. Examples of NDD-associated genes linked across more than one disorder (listed in order of occurrence frequency) are <i>NRXN1</i>, <i>SEH1L</i>, <i>LDLRAD4</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, <i>GNG13</i>, <i>MKRN1</i>, <i>DCTN2, KNDC1</i>, <i>PCMTD2</i>, <i>KIF5A</i>, <i>SYNM</i>, and long non-coding RNAs: <i>AK127244</i> and <i>PTCHD1-AS</i>. We demonstrated that CNVs impacting the same genes could potentially contribute to the etiology of multiple NDDs. The CNVs identified will serve as a useful resource for both research and diagnostic laboratories for prioritization of variants."	"Neurexins are presynaptic, cell-adhesion molecules that specify the functional properties of synapses via interactions with trans-synaptic ligands. Neurexins are extensively alternatively spliced at six canonical sites that regulate multifarious ligand interactions, but the structural mechanisms underlying alternative splicing-dependent neurexin regulation are largely unknown. Here, we determined high-resolution structures of the complex of neurexophilin-1 and the second laminin/neurexin/sex-hormone-binding globulin domain (LNS2) of neurexin-1 and examined how alternative splicing at splice site #2 (SS2) regulates the complex. Our data reveal a unique, extensive, neurexophilin-neurexin binding interface that extends the jelly-roll β-sandwich of LNS2 of neurexin-1 into neurexophilin-1. The SS2A insert of LNS2 augments this interface, increasing the binding affinity of LNS2 for neurexophilin-1. Taken together, our data reveal an unexpected architecture of neurexophilin-neurexin complexes that accounts for the modulation of binding by alternative splicing, which in turn regulates the competition of neurexophilin for neurexin binding with other ligands."	"Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective, and Bipolar disorders share behavioral and phenomenological traits, intermediate phenotypes, and some associated genetic loci with pleiotropic effects. Volumetric abnormalities in brain structures are among the intermediate phenotypes consistently reported associated with these disorders. In order to examine the genetic underpinnings of these structural brain modifications, we performed genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) on 60 quantitative structural brain MRI phenotypes in a sample of 777 subjects (483 cases and 294 controls pooled together). Genotyping was performed with the Illumina PsychChip microarray, followed by imputation to the 1000 genomes multiethnic reference panel. Enlargement of the Temporal Horns of Lateral Ventricles (THLV) is associated with an intronic SNP of the gene NRXN1 (rs12467877, P = 6.76E-10), which accounts for 4.5% of the variance in size. Enlarged THLV is associated with psychosis in this sample, and with reduction of the hippocampus and enlargement of the choroid plexus and caudate. Eight other suggestively significant associations (P &lt; 5.5E-8) were identified with THLV and 5 other brain structures. Although rare deletions of NRXN1 have been previously associated with psychosis, this is the first report of a common SNP variant of NRXN1 associated with enlargement of the THLV in psychosis."	"To explore the genetic basis for a patient with autism.High-throughput sequencing was carried out to detect copy number variations in the patient.DNA sequencing found that the patient has carried a 0.11 Mb deletion in distal 2p16.3 spanning from genomic position 50 820 001 to 50 922 000, which resulted removal of exon 6 and part of intron 7 of the NRXN1 gene. The same deletion was not found his parents and brother.Partial deletion of the NRXN1 gene may underlie the disease in this patient."	"In addition to its role as an endocrine messenger, growth hormone (GH) also acts as a neurotrophic factor in the central nervous system (CNS), whose effects are involved in neuroprotection, axonal growth, and synaptogenic modulation. An increasing amount of clinical evidence shows a beneficial effect of GH treatment in patients with brain trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, impaired cognitive function, and neurodegenerative processes. In response to injury, Müller cells transdifferentiate into neural progenitors and proliferate, which constitutes an early regenerative process in the chicken retina. In this work, we studied the long-term protective effect of GH after causing severe excitotoxic damage in the retina. Thus, an acute neural injury was induced via the intravitreal injection of kainic acid (KA, 20 µg), which was followed by chronic administration of GH (10 injections [300 ng] over 21 days). Damage provoked a severe disruption of several retinal layers. However, in KA-damaged retinas treated with GH, we observed a significant restoration of the inner plexiform layer (IPL, 2.4-fold) and inner nuclear layer (INL, 1.5-fold) thickness and a general improvement of the retinal structure. In addition, we also observed an increase in the expression of several genes involved in important regenerative pathways, including: synaptogenic markers (DLG1, NRXN1, GAP43); glutamate receptor subunits (NR1 and GRIK4); pro-survival factors (BDNF, Bcl-2 and TNF-R2); and Notch signaling proteins (Notch1 and Hes5). Interestingly, Müller cell transdifferentiation markers (Sox2 and FGF2) were upregulated by this long-term chronic GH treatment. These results are consistent with a significant increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells observed in the KA-damaged retina, which was induced by GH administration. Our data suggest that GH is able to facilitate the early proliferative response of the injured retina and enhance the regeneration of neurite interconnections."	"<b>Objective:</b> To screen the differentially expressed genes, functional enrichment and related signaling pathways in glioma by bioinformatics analysis. <b>Methods:</b> Microarray data of glioma related gene expression profiles were selected in GEO database, and differentially expressed genes in glioma patients and normal brain tissues were screened by R statistical software of lima package. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes (GO and KEGG) was performed. The protein-protein interaction database (STRING) was used to analyze the interaction between the screened differentially expressed genes and the related signaling pathways. <b>Results:</b> Two gene expression profiles, GSE15824 and GSE66354, were selected for analysis, and 158 genes with differential expression more than 2 times and <i>P&lt;</i>0.05 were screened. Molecular function (MF) of 158 differentially expressed genes was integrin binding, cell adhesion molecule binding, calcium binding and AMPA glutamate receptor activity. Cell component localization (CC) was located in cell membrane, neuron cell body, axon of nerve cell and so on, while biological process (BP) was mainly cell adhesion and nervous system. Development, cell proliferation, GTPase activity, apoptosis and angiogenesis; KEGG signaling pathways were mainly cAMP signaling pathway, purine metabolism pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. There were 177 interaction connections in 158 differential expression gene-protein interaction networks, with an average interaction of 2.39 between each node and an aggregation coefficient of 0.37. Cytohubb screened the key genes (hub genes) in the signaling pathway. The results indicated that SLC6A1,SLC1A2,BDNF,GAP43,NRXN1,GAD1,OLIG2, PLP1,S100B and GRIA3 were the key genes in the signaling pathway of the interacting protein network. All the 10 key genes were related to the prognosis of patients (<i>P&lt;</i>0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> There are differentially expressed genes profile in glioma tissues and normal tissues. SLC6A1, SLC1A2, BDNF, GAP43, NRXN1, GAD1, OLIG2, PLP1, S100B and GRIA3 are key genes for glioma development and are related to the prognosis of patients."
"PURA"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Aging is characterized by the functional and regenerative decline of tissues and organs. This regenerative decline is a consequence of the numerical and functional loss of adult stem cells, which are the corner stone of tissue homeostasis and repair. A palpable example of this decline is provided by skeletal muscle, a specialized tissue composed of postmitotic myofibers that contract to generate force. Skeletal muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are long-lived and support muscle regeneration throughout life, but at advanced age they fail for largely undefined reasons. Here, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of how satellite cells integrate diverse intrinsic and extrinsic processes to ensure optimal homeostatic function and how this integration is perturbed during aging, causing regenerative failure. With this increased understanding, it is now feasible to design and test interventions that delay satellite cell aging. We discuss the exciting new therapeutic potential of integrating and combining distinct anti-aging strategies for regenerative medicine."	"This study was designed to determine alterations in renal biomarkers, antioxidant profile, and histomorphology of renal tissue following subacute exposure to quinalphos alone or in conjunction with arsenic in rats. A total of 54 adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into nine groups of six rats each and were administered sub-lethal concentrations of quinalphos (1/100<sup>th</sup> and 1/10<sup>th</sup> of LD<sub>50</sub>) orally daily and arsenic (50 and 100 ppb) in drinking water for 28 days. Significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased levels of antioxidant biomarkers in renal tissue, viz., total thiols, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-s-transferase, and glutathione reductase along with increased (p &lt; 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reacting substance (TBRAS) levels indicated that significant oxidative damage to renal tissue occurred following repeated administrations of quinalphos at either dose levels or arsenic at the concentration of 100 ppb when compared with the control rats. The alterations in the antioxidant parameters were observed to be more pronounced in co-administered groups as compared with either toxicant administered group. Similarly, activity of renal acetylcholinesterase was decreased after repeated exposure to quinalphos or arsenic, but inhibition was higher (up to 48%) in rat renal tissue co-exposed with quinalphos and arsenic at the higher concentration. These findings corroborated with the histopathological alterations in renal tissue of toxicant exposed rats. The altered plasma and tissue antioxidant biomarkers along with histopathological changes in the kidney at higher dose level of either toxicant indicate that renal tissue is significantly impacted by these toxicants, and these effects become more pronounced after their co-administration."	"Granule formation has been recognized as a promising biotechnology in denitrifying phosphorus removal (DPR) systems by facilitating phosphorus accumulation organisms (PAOs) especially denitrifying PAOs (DPAOs), and hydraulic selection made this a more difficult task in continuous operation. This study aimed at exploring the microscopic mechanism and putting forward an effective strategy for DPR granulation under the impact of hydraulic retention time (HRT) (12 h, 10 h, 8 h) in a novel Anaerobic Anoxic Oxic - Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (A<sup>2</sup>/O - MBBR) system. With the reduction of intracellular carbon storage (COD<sub>intra</sub>) efficiency (88.58%-78.53%), nitrogen (N) (85.45%-79.11%) and phosphorus (P) (96.55%-92.47%) removals both dropped, but it exhibited a growth of anoxic phosphorus uptake rate (PUR<sub>A</sub>) (3.79-5.68 mg P/(gMLVSS·h)). The batch tests associating with substrate transformation of poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA), glycogen (Gly) agreed well with the corresponding stoichiometry of phosphorus release rate (PRR) (4.83-7.53 mg P/(gMLVSS·h)), PUR<sub>A</sub> (3.55-5.43 mg P/(gMLVSS·h)), oxic phosphorus uptake rate (PUR<sub>O</sub>) (6.08-6.21 mg P/(gMLVSS·h)), and DPAOs/PAOs ratios (57.17%-89.31%), indicating a shift of microbial community. DPR granules gradually stabilized with low sludge volume index (SVI<sub>5</sub>/SVI<sub>30</sub> ratio = 1.1-1.2), dense and compact structure, higher P content (11.63%), more extracted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (111.40-160.31 mg/gMLVSS) as proteins/polysaccharides (PN/PS) ratios (1.70-3.47) increased, leading to better sludge settleability and cell hydrophobicity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results showed that PAOs (mainly Cluster I: 20.20%) were the dominant bacteria in the A<sup>2</sup>/O reactor although a small amount of Defluviicoccus (3.18-3.48%) was responsible for nitrite accumulation, while ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (mainly Nitrosomonas: 10.75%) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) (mainly Nitrospira: 15.06%) were enriched in the MBBR."	"Catastrophic optical damage (COD) is one of the processes limiting the lifetime of high-power laser diodes. The understanding of this degradation phenomenon is critical to improve the laser power and lifetime for practical applications. In this Letter, we analyze the defect propagation inside the cavity of quantum well (QW) high-power laser diodes presenting COD. For this, we studied the effect of highly localized thermal gradients and degraded regions on the laser field distribution. Finite element method (FEM) simulations are compared to experimental cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. The presence of micrometric hot spots inside the QW induces the thermal lensing of the laser field. The laser self-focusing inside the cavity eventually generates a new hot spot, and, in a repetitive way, a sequence of hot spots would be created. This would account for the propagation of the dark line defects (DLDs) that are characteristic of this degradation mode."	"Native pollinators are important for providing vital services in agroecosystems; however, their numbers are declining globally. Bees are the most efficient and diverse members of the pollinator community; therefore, it is imperative that management strategies be implemented that positively affect bee community composition and health. Here, we test responses of the bee and flowering plant communities to land management treatments in the context of grasslands in the upper Midwestern United States, a critical area with respect to bee declines. Twelve sites were selected to examine floral resources and wild bee communities based on three different types of grasslands: tallgrass prairie remnants, ungrazed restorations, and grazed restorations. Total bee abundance was significantly higher in ungrazed restorations than remnants, but there were no significant differences among grasslands in community composition or Shannon diversity. Across the three grassland types we also examined mass and lipid stores as nutritional health indicators in three sweat bees (Halictidae), Augochlora pura, Agapostemon virescens, and Halictus ligatus. Although there were no differences in lipid content, total average bee mass was significantly higher in Ag. virescens collected from ungrazed restorations as compared to remnants. Floral abundance of native and non-native species combined was significantly higher in grazed restorations compared to remnants and ungrazed restorations. However, ungrazed restorations had higher abundance and richness of native flowering ramets. These data suggest that bee abundance and nutrition are driven by high abundance of native flowering plant species, rather than total flowering plants."	"The effect of various acetate/propionate ratios (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 0:1) in a two-sludge A<sup>2</sup>/O - MBBR process was investigated. Results showed that the increased propionic/acetic ratios exerted indistinctive impact on COD (91.21-93.44%) and P (92.23-93.87%) removals, but high P content (7.42%) accelerated sludge granulation proved by SEM and EDS. Acetate favored N removal (79.52%-82.92%) with higher PUR<sub>A</sub> (3.53-4.06 mgP/(gVSS·h)), while the removal declined (75.14%) due to lower PHB/PHA ratio (52.3-57.8%) with propionate as sole carbon source. Based on the stoichiometry-based quantifications, PAOs were the major contributors to nutrient removal although certain GAOs and OHO participated. The mixture ratio of 1:1 facilitated microbial diversity (995 OTUs), Rhodobacteraceae (25.63%) was responsible for high-efficient denitrifying phosphorus removal, while Defluviicoccus (15.23%) contributed to nitrite accumulation was the main competitiveness with PAOs. Nitrospira, Nitrosomonas, and Nitrosomonadaceae responsible for nitrification accounted for 7.73%, 27.11%, and 38.76% in MBBR, but the biodiversity decreased owing to the enrichment and purification."	"We present two new methods for simultaneous smoothing and sharpening of color images: the GMS<sup>3</sup> (Graph Method for Simultaneous Smoothing and Sharpening) and the NGMS<sup>3</sup>(Normalized Graph-Method for Simultaneous Smoothing and Sharpening). They are based on analyzing the structure of local graphs computed at every pixel using their respective neighbors. On the one hand, we define a kernel-based filter for smoothing each pixel with the pixels associated to nodes in its same connected component. On the other hand, we modify each pixel by increasing their differences with respect to the pixels in the other connected components of those local graphs. Our approach is shown to be competitive with respect to other state-of-the-art methods that simultaneously manage both processes.•We provide two methods that carry out the process of smoothing and sharpening simultaneously.•The methods are based on the analysis of the structure of a local graph defined from the differences in the RGB space among the pixels in a 3 × 3 window.•The parameters of the method are adjusted using both observers opinion and the well-known reference image quality assessment BRISQUE (Blind/Referenceless images spatial quality Evaluator) score."	"The root-associated habit has evolved on numerous occasions in different fungal lineages, suggesting a strong evolutionary pressure for saprotrophic fungi to switch to symbiotic associations with plants. Species within the ubiquitous, saprotrophic genus Mycena are frequently major components in molecular studies of root-associated fungal communities, suggesting that an evaluation of their trophic status is warranted. Here, we report on interactions between a range of Mycena species and the plant Betula pendula. In all, 17 Mycena species were inoculated onto B. pendula seedlings. Physical interactions between hyphae and fine roots were examined using differential staining and fluorescence microscopy. Physiological interactions were investigated using <sup>14</sup> C and <sup>32</sup> P to show potential transfer between symbionts. All Mycena species associated closely with fine roots, showing hyphal penetration into the roots, which in some cases were intracellular. Seven species formed mantle-like structures around root tips, but none formed a Hartig net. Mycena pura and Mycena galopus both enhanced seedling growth, with M. pura showing significant transfer of <sup>32</sup> P to the seedlings. Our results support the view that several Mycena species can associate closely with plant roots and some may potentially occupy a transitional state between saprotrophy and biotrophy."	"Potato blackleg is caused by a diverse species of pectinolytic bacteria. In Pakistan, approximately 90% of the pathogens involved belong to <i>Pectobacterium atrosepticum.</i> Survey (2014 to 2017), sampling, and isolation from different potato growing areas of Punjab, Pakistan depicted an overall disease incidence of approximately 15%. Thirty-six pectinolytic strains confirmed through biochemical and pathogenicity testing were characterized via <i>gapA</i> gene to identify them at the species level. To further validate the identification, one strain from each species SS26 (<i>P. atrosepticum</i>), SS28 (<i>Pectobacterium polaris</i>), SS70 (<i>Dickeya dianthicola</i>), SS90 (<i>Pectobacterium parmentieri</i>), SS95 (<i>Pectobacterium punjabense</i>), and SS96 (<i>Pectobacterium versatile</i>) were selected for draft genome sequencing and multilocus sequence analysis of 13 housekeeping genes (<i>fusA</i>, <i>rpoD</i>, <i>acnA</i>, <i>purA</i>, <i>gyrB</i>, <i>recA</i>, <i>mdh</i>, <i>mtlD</i>, <i>groEL</i>, <i>secY</i>, <i>glyA</i>, <i>gapA</i>, and <i>rplB</i>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed considerable genetic diversity in the genus <i>Pectobacterium</i>. <i>In silico</i> DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values of the strains selected for genome sequencing were determined with other reference <i>Pectobacterium</i> and <i>Dickeya</i> strains. Moreover, all six representative strains were also phenotypically characterized on the basis of metabolism of different carbon sources. Overall, on the basis of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, these 36 isolates were grouped into six species: <i>P. atrosepticum</i>, <i>P. versatile</i>, <i>P. parmentieri</i>, <i>P. polaris</i>, <i>P. punjabense</i>, and <i>D. dianthicola</i>."	"Attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood and has the potential for continuity into adolescence and adulthood. Its presence increases difficulties in academic performance and social interactions besides leading to low self-esteem. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of ADHD among children of age 6-12 years in Government schools of a rural area in Jammu district of J and K.The present study was conducted in R.S. Pura block of Jammu district. Miran Sahib zone of R.S Pura block was chosen randomly and all the government primary schools in this zone were included in the survey. The presence of ADHD was assessed using Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic teacher rating scale. The children positive for ADHD were visited at their residential places and a personal information questionnaire (PIQ) was administered to their parents-preferably the mother. The data thus collected was presented as proportions.ADHD prevalence was found to be 6.34% (13/205). Majority (69.3%) of the ADHD-positive children were living in a joint family and belonged to lower/lower middle class. Family history of ADHD was absent in all the ADHD-positive children.The current study conducted in a rural area among 6- to 12-year-old children of Government schools has shown a reasonably high ADHD prevalence of 6.34%."	"We report the case of a Caucasian Spanish boy, who showed profound neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulties, apnea, severe developmental delay, epilepsy, bilateral convergent strabismus, poor verbal language development and a large brainstem. Whole-exome sequence uncovered a novel <i>de novo</i> mutation in the purine-rich element binding protein A gene (<i>PURA</i>; NM_005859.4:c.72del:p.(-Gly25AlafsTer53)) that encodes the transcriptional activator protein Pur-alpha (PURA). Mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with PURA syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by an early hypotonia, developmental delay, severe intellectual disability with or without epilepsy, and disability in expressive language development. Although, up to 75 cases have been identified worldwide, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first patient described with a brainstem larger than normal. In conclusion, our data expand both geneticand phenotypic spectrum associated with <i>PURA</i> gene mutations."	"Comments and information appearing on the internet and on different social media sway opinion concerning potential remedies for diagnosing and curing diseases. In many cases, this has an impact on citizens' health and affects medical professionals, who find themselves having to defend their diagnoses as well as the treatments they propose against ill-informed patients. The propagation of these opinions follows the same pattern as the dissemination of fake news about other important topics, such as the environment, via social media networks, which we use as a testing ground for checking our procedure. In this article, we present an algorithm to analyse the behaviour of users of Twitter, the most important social network with respect to this issue, as well as a dynamic knowledge graph construction method based on information gathered from Twitter and other open data sources such as web pages. To show our methodology, we present a concrete example of how the associated graph structure of the tweets related to World Environment Day 2019 is used to develop a heuristic analysis of the validity of the information. The proposed analytical scheme is based on the interaction between the computer tool-a database implemented with Neo4j-and the analyst, who must ask the right questions to the tool, allowing to follow the line of any doubtful data. We also show how this method can be used. We also present some methodological guidelines on how our system could allow, in the future, an automation of the procedures for the construction of an autonomous algorithm for the detection of false news on the internet related to health."	"This study investigated the diagnostic utility of nontargeted genomic testing in patients with pediatric heart disease.We analyzed genome sequencing data of 111 families with cardiac lesions for rare, disease-associated variation.In 14 families (12.6%), we identified causative variants: seven were de novo (ANKRD11, KMT2D, NR2F2, POGZ, PTPN11, PURA, SALL1) and six were inherited from parents with no or subclinical heart phenotypes (FLT4, DNAH9, MYH11, NEXMIF, NIPBL, PTPN11). Outcome of the testing was associated with the presence of extracardiac features (p = 0.02), but not a positive family history for cardiac lesions (p = 0.67). We also report novel plausible gene-disease associations for tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary stenosis (CDC42BPA, FGD5), hypoplastic left or right heart (SMARCC1, TLN2, TRPM4, VASP), congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (UBXN10), and early-onset cardiomyopathy (TPCN1). The identified candidate genes have critical functions in heart development, such as angiogenesis, mechanotransduction, regulation of heart size, chromatin remodeling, or ciliogenesis.This data set demonstrates the diagnostic and scientific value of genome sequencing in pediatric heart disease, anticipating its role as a first-tier diagnostic test. The genetic heterogeneity will necessitate large-scale genomic initiatives for delineating novel gene-disease associations."	"Increased Pur-alpha (Pura) protein levels in animal models alleviate certain cellular symptoms of the disease spectrum amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). Pura is a member of the Pur family of evolutionarily conserved guanine-rich polynucleotide binding proteins containing a repeated signature PUR domain of 60-80 amino acids. Here we have employed a synthetic peptide, TZIP, similar to a Pur domain, but with sequence alterations based on a consensus of evolutionarily conserved Pur family binding domains and having an added transporter sequence. A major familial form of ALS/FTD, C9orf72 (C9), is due to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) of (GGGGCC), a Pur binding element. We show by circular dichroism that RNA oligonucleotides containing this purine-rich sequence consist largely of parallel G-quadruplexes. TZIP peptide binds this repeat sequence in both DNA and RNA. It binds the RNA element, including the G-quadruplexes, with a high degree of specificity versus a random oligonucleotide. In addition, TZIP binds both linear and G-quadruplex repeat RNA to form higher order G-quadruplex secondary structures. This change in conformational form by Pur-based peptide represents a new mechanism for regulating G quadruplex secondary structure within the C9 repeat. TZIP modulation of C9 RNA structural configuration may alter interaction of the complex with other proteins. This Pur-based mechanism provides new targets for therapy, and it may help to explain Pura alleviation of certain cellular pathological aspects of ALS/FTD."	"By interacting with proteins and nucleic acids, the vast family of mammalian circRNAs is proposed to influence many biological processes. Here, RNA sequencing analysis of circRNAs differentially expressed during myogenesis revealed that circSamd4 expression increased robustly in mouse C2C12 myoblasts differentiating into myotubes. Moreover, silencing circSamd4, which is conserved between human and mouse, delayed myogenesis and lowered the expression of myogenic markers in cultured myoblasts from both species. Affinity pulldown followed by mass spectrometry revealed that circSamd4 associated with PURA and PURB, two repressors of myogenesis that inhibit transcription of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein family. Supporting the hypothesis that circSamd4 might complex with PUR proteins and thereby prevent their interaction with DNA, silencing circSamd4 enhanced the association of PUR proteins with the Mhc promoter, while overexpressing circSamd4 interfered with the binding of PUR proteins to the Mhc promoter. These effects were abrogated when using a mutant circSamd4 lacking the PUR binding site. Our results indicate that the association of PUR proteins with circSamd4 enhances myogenesis by contributing to the derepression of MHC transcription."	"A unique property of skeletal muscle is its ability to adapt its mass to changes in activity. Inactivity, as in disuse or aging, causes atrophy, the loss of muscle mass and strength, leading to physical incapacity and poor quality of life. Here, through a combination of transcriptomics and transgenesis, we identify sestrins, a family of stress-inducible metabolic regulators, as protective factors against muscle wasting. Sestrin expression decreases during inactivity and its genetic deficiency exacerbates muscle wasting; conversely, sestrin overexpression suffices to prevent atrophy. This protection occurs through mTORC1 inhibition, which upregulates autophagy, and AKT activation, which in turn inhibits FoxO-regulated ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis. This study reveals sestrin as a central integrator of anabolic and degradative pathways preventing muscle wasting. Since sestrin also protected muscles against aging-induced atrophy, our findings have implications for sarcopenia."	"This work proposes the development of a simple, fast, and inexpensive methodology based on color histograms (obtained from digital images), and supervised pattern recognition techniques to classify red wines produced in the São Francisco Valley (SFV) region to trace geographic origin, winemaker, and grape variety. PCA-LDA coupled with HSI histograms correctly differentiated all of the SFV samples from the other geographic regions in the test set; SPA-LDA selecting just 10 variables in the Grayscale + HSI histogram achieved 100% accuracy in the test set when classifying three different SFV winemakers. Regarding the three grape varieties, SPA-LDA selected 15 variables in the RGB histogram to obtain the best result, misclassifying only 2 samples in the test set. Pairwise grape variety classification was also performed with only 1 misclassification. Besides following the principles of Green Chemistry, the proposed methodology is a suitable analytical tool; for tracing origins, grape type, and even (SFV) winemakers."	"Job rotation is an organizational strategy based on the systematic exchange of workers between jobs in a planned manner according to specific criteria. This study presents the GS-Rot method, a method based on Game Theory, in order to design job rotation schedules by considering not only workers' job preferences, but also the competencies required for different jobs. With this approach, we promote workers' active participation in the design of the rotation plan. It also let us deal with restrictions in assigning workers to job positions according to their disabilities (temporal or permanent). The GS-Rot method has been implemented online and applied to a case in a work environment characterized by the presence of a high repetition of movements, which is a significant risk factor associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). A total of 17 workstations and 17 workers were involved in the rotation, four of them with physical/psychological limitations. Feasible job rotation schedules were obtained in a short time (average time 27.4 milliseconds). The results indicate that in the rotations driven by preference priorities, almost all the workers (94.11%) were assigned to one of their top five preferences. Likewise, 48.52% of job positions were assigned to workers in their top five of their competence lists. When jobs were assigned according to competence, 58.82% of workers got an assignment among their top five competence lists. Furthermore, 55.87% of the workers achieved jobs in their top five preferences. In both rotation scenarios, the workers varied performed jobs, and fatigue accumulation was balanced among them. The GS-Rot method achieved feasible and uniform solutions regarding the workers' exposure to job repetitiveness."	NA	NA
"SCN2A"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders. TSEs are characterized by the accumulation of prions (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) that represent pathological isoforms of the physiological cellular prion protein PrP<sup>C</sup>. Although the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is still not completely understood, blocking this process may lead to develop new therapies. Here, we have generated a pharmacophore model, based on anti-prion molecules reported in literature to be effective in phenotypic assay. The model was used to conduct a virtual screen of commercial compound databases that selected a small library of ten compounds. These molecules were then screened in mouse neuroblastoma cell line chronically infected with prions (ScN2a) after excluding neurotoxicity. 1 has been identified as the therapeutic hit on the basis of the following evidence: chronic treatments of ScN2a cells using 1 eliminate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> loaded in both Western blotting analysis and Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay. We also proposed the mechanism of action of 1 by which it has the ability to bind PrP<sup>C</sup> and consequentially blocks prion conversion. Herein we describe the results of these efforts."	"Efforts to identify the causes of autism spectrum disorders have highlighted the importance of both genetics and environment, but the lack of human models for many of these disorders limits researchers' attempts to understand the mechanisms of disease and to develop new treatments. Induced pluripotent stem cells offer the opportunity to study specific genetic and environmental risk factors, but the heterogeneity of donor genetics may obscure important findings. Diseases associated with unusually high rates of autism, such as SCN2A syndromes, provide an opportunity to study specific mutations with high effect sizes in a human genetic context and may reveal biological insights applicable to more common forms of autism. Loss-of-function mutations in the SCN2A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, are associated with autism rates up to 50%. Here, we review the findings from experimental models of SCN2A syndromes, including mouse and human cell studies, highlighting the potential role for patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell technology to identify the molecular and cellular substrates of autism."	"Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies with burst suppression (EOEE-BS) are a group of neonatal epileptic syndromes characterized by intractable epilepsy and severe psychomotor delay with structural and metabolic factors accounting for major etiologies. However, recent advances in gene sequencing have identified that genetic factors might also play a significant role in the development of EOEE-BS. Herein, we used various genetic tests to identify pathogenic genetic variants in EOEE-BS irrespective of structural malformations and analyzed the clinical features associated with each different etiology.A total of 48 patients with EOEE-BS were included. Except for patients with severe hypoxic damage, patients with structural malformations were included in our patient cohort. Clinical features of the patients were reviewed, and etiological diagnoses were made based on several genetic tests, metabolic studies, and radiological findings.A genetic diagnosis was made in 31 (64.6 %) patients, with the most commonly diagnosed gene being STXBP1 (n = 13, 27.1 %), followed by KCNQ2 (n = 5, 10.4 %), SCN2A (n = 5, 10.4 %), DEPDC5 (n = 3, 6.3 %), CASK (n = 1, 2.1 %), CDKL5 (n = 1, 2.1 %), GNAO1 (n = 1, 2.1 %), SLC6A8 (n = 1, 2.1 %), and LIS1 deletion (n = 1, 2.1 %). Other than the classification of epilepsy syndrome, no clinical features were associated with the genetically diagnosed group. Among eight patients with structural malformations, genetic diagnosis was achieved in five (62.5 %), and those patients had pathogenic mutations in DEPDC5 and CASK or LIS1 deletion, indicating the significance of gene sequencing irrespective of structural abnormalities. Treatment responses to a variety of medications and the ketogenic diet differed by etiology, and surgical resection proved to be effective in patients with cortical dysplasia.Genetic etiologies are an important factor in EOEE-BS irrespective of structural malformations and the treatment options may differ by etiology."	"Genetic variants in brain-expressed voltage-gated sodium channels (SCNs) have emerged as one of the most frequent causes of Mendelian forms of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). This review explores the biological concepts that underlie sodium channel NDDs, explains their phenotypic heterogeneity, and appraises how this knowledge may inform clinical practice. We observe that excitatory/inhibitory neuronal expression ratios of sodium channels are important regulatory mechanisms underlying brain development, homeostasis, and neurological diseases. We hypothesize that a detailed understanding of gene expression, variant tolerance, location, and function, as well as timing of seizure onset can aid the understanding of how variants in SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN8A contribute to seizure aetiology and inform treatment choice. We propose a model in which variant type, development-specific gene expression, and functions of SCNs explain the heterogeneity of sodium channel associated NDDs. Understanding of basic disease mechanisms and detailed knowledge of variant characteristics have increasing influence on clinical decision making, enabling us to stratify treatment and move closer towards precision medicine in sodium channel epilepsy and NDDs."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder with an unclear aetiology and an estimated global prevalence of 1%. However, studies of ASD in the Vietnamese population are limited. Here, we first conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) of 100 children with ASD and their unaffected parents. Our stringent analysis pipeline was able to detect 18 unique variants (8 de novo and 10 ×-linked, all validated), including 12 newly discovered variants. Interestingly, a notable number of X-linked variants were detected (56%), and all of them were found in affected males but not in affected females. We uncovered 17 genes from our ASD cohort in which CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, SCN2A, OFD1 and MDB5 have been previously identified as ASD risk genes, suggesting the universal aetiology of ASD for these genes. In addition, we identified six genes that have not been previously reported in any autism database: CHM, ENPP1, IGF1, LAS1L, SYP and TBX22. Gene ontology and phenotype-genotype analysis suggested that variants in IGF1, SYP and LAS1L could plausibly confer risk for ASD. Taken together, this study adds to the genetic heterogeneity of ASD and is the first report elucidating the genetic landscape of ASD in Vietnamese children."	"The efficacy of valproic acid (VPA) varies widely in clinical treatment of epileptic patients. Our study is aimed at exploring a potential association between polymorphisms of SCN1A, SCN2A, and UGT2B7 genetic factors and VPA responses.In this observational study, a total of 114 epileptic patients only treated with VPA for at least 1 year were included to explore the genetic polymorphisms of drug responses (mean follow-up time: 3.68 ± 1.78 years). Thirty-one single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three candidate genes that related with drug-metabolizing enzymes and receptors were genotyped.Of the 31 SNPs, eight were significantly associated with VPA responses, including rs1381105, rs2162600, rs10197716, rs2119068, rs2119067, rs353116, rs353112 and rs6740895. The interaction between rs10197716 and rs2119068 was the most significantly correlated with VPA responses compared with other combinations (the highest VPA-responsive rate 0.92 versus the lowest VPA-responsive rate 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.007).The study indicated that eight SNPs and SNP-SNP interaction may be associated with VPA responses in Chinese Han epileptic patients. The SNPs were rs1381105 (SCN1A), rs2162600 (SCN1A), rs10197716 (SCN2A), rs2119068 (SCN2A), rs2119067 (SCN2A), rs353116 (SCN2A), rs353112 (SCN2A) and rs6740895 (SCN2A), respectively. The interaction between the three pairs of rs10197716-rs2119068, rs10197716-rs11889342 and rs7598931-rs12233719 was the most significant for VPA. This implied that these SNPs may play an important role in the pharmacogenomics mechanism of valproic acid."	"Voltage-gated sodium channels (SCNs) share similar amino acid sequence, structure, and function. Genetic variants in the four human brain-expressed SCN genes SCN1A/2A/3A/8A have been associated with heterogeneous epilepsy phenotypes and neurodevelopmental disorders. To better understand the biology of seizure susceptibility in SCN-related epilepsies, our aim was to determine similarities and differences between sodium channel disorders, allowing us to develop a broader perspective on precision treatment than on an individual gene level alone.We analyzed genotype-phenotype correlations in large SCN-patient cohorts and applied variant constraint analysis to identify severe sodium channel disease. We examined temporal patterns of human SCN expression and correlated functional data from in vitro studies with clinical phenotypes across different sodium channel disorders.Comparing 865 epilepsy patients (504 SCN1A, 140 SCN2A, 171 SCN8A, four SCN3A, 46 copy number variation [CNV] cases) and analysis of 114 functional studies allowed us to identify common patterns of presentation. All four epilepsy-associated SCN genes demonstrated significant constraint in both protein truncating and missense variation when compared to other SCN genes. We observed that age at seizure onset is related to SCN gene expression over time. Individuals with gain-of-function SCN2A/3A/8A missense variants or CNV duplications share similar characteristics, most frequently present with early onset epilepsy (&lt;3 months), and demonstrate good response to sodium channel blockers (SCBs). Direct comparison of corresponding SCN variants across different SCN subtypes illustrates that the functional effects of variants in corresponding channel locations are similar; however, their clinical manifestation differs, depending on their role in different types of neurons in which they are expressed.Variant function and location within one channel can serve as a surrogate for variant effects across related sodium channels. Taking a broader view on precision treatment suggests that in those patients with a suspected underlying genetic epilepsy presenting with neonatal or early onset seizures (&lt;3 months), SCBs should be considered."	"Developmental disorders (DDs) are early onset disorders affecting 5%-10% of children worldwide. Chromosomal microarray analysis detecting CNVs is currently recommended as the first-tier test for DD diagnosis. However, this analysis omits a high percentage of disease-causing single nucleotide variations (SNVs) that warrant further sequencing. Currently, next-generation sequencing can be used in clinical scenarios detecting CNVs, and the use of exome sequencing in the DD cohort ahead of the microarray test has not been evaluated.Clinical exome sequencing (CES) was performed on 1090 unrelated Chinese DD patients who were classified into five phenotype subgroups. CNVs and SNVs were both detected and analysed based on sequencing data.An overall diagnostic rate of 41.38% was achieved with the combinational analysis of CNV and SNV. Over 12.02% of patients were diagnosed based on CNV, which was comparable with the published CMA diagnostic rate, while 0.74% were traditionally elusive cases who had dual diagnosis or apparently homozygous mutations that were clarified. The diagnostic rates among subgroups ranged from 21.82% to 50.32%. The top three recurrent cytobands with diagnostic CNVs were 15q11.2-q13.1, 22q11.21 and 7q11.23. The top three genes with diagnostic SNVs were: <i>MECP2</i>, <i>SCN1A</i> and <i>SCN2A</i>. Both the diagnostic rate and spectrums of CNVs and SNVs showed differences among the phenotype subgroups.With a higher diagnostic rate, more comprehensive observation of variations and lower cost compared with conventional strategies, simultaneous analysis of CNVs and SNVs based on CES showed potential as a new first-tier choice to diagnose DD."	"Epileptic encephalopathies are severe forms of infantile-onset epilepsy often complicated by severe neurodevelopmental impairments. Some forms of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) have been associated with variants in SCN2A, which encodes the brain voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2. Many voltage-gated sodium channel genes, including SCN2A, undergo developmentally regulated mRNA splicing. The early onset of these disorders suggests that developmentally regulated alternative splicing of NaV1.2 may be an important consideration when elucidating the pathophysiological consequences of epilepsy-associated variants. We hypothesized that EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants would exhibit greater dysfunction in a splice isoform that is prominently expressed during early development. We engineered five EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants (T236S, E999K, S1336Y, T1623N, and R1882Q) into the adult and neonatal splice isoforms of NaV1.2 and performed whole-cell voltage clamp to elucidate their functional properties. All variants exhibited functional defects that could enhance neuronal excitability. Three of the five variants (T236S, E999K, and S1336Y) exhibited greater dysfunction in the neonatal isoform compared with those observed in the adult isoform. Computational modeling of a developing cortical pyramidal neuron indicated that T236S, E999K, S1336Y, and R1882Q showed hyperexcitability preferentially in immature neurons. These results suggest that both splice isoform and neuronal developmental stage influence how EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants affect neuronal excitability."	"In many neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondria are actively involved in the onset and/or progression of diseases because the energy depletion of the neuronal cells directly leads to the dysfunction and degeneration of cells. In the case of prion diseases, mitochondrial involvement has been reported recently and evidence that prion protein (PrP) is localized in mitochondria is increasing. Despite these findings, the precise molecular mechanism by which PrP targets mitochondria remains unclear. PrP is a secretory protein and does not have a pre-sequence that targets the mitochondria, therefore, we thought that there was a covert signal in the amino acid sequence of PrP. To find the sequence, we constructed various GFP-fused PrP-truncations and colocalization with mitochondria was verified by live-cell imaging. Consequently, we found that 18 amino acids, PrP (122-139), are indispensable for the mitochondrial targeting of PrP. In addition, fluorescent microscopy observation revealed that PrP-localized mitochondria were accumulated at the perinuclear region in neuronal cells such as mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) and prion persistent infection N2a strain (ScN2a), anterograde movement of the mitochondria toward the cell membrane was completely inhibited because of the stacking of PrP on the outer membrane. The cristae formation of perinuclear accumulated mitochondria was disappeared indicating the reduced mitochondrial activity. Surprisingly, PrP-dependent mitochondrial perinuclear accumulation was specifically occurred on neuronal cells, whereas in epithelial HeLa cells and fibroblast COS-7 cells, no perinuclear accumulation observed even after the mitochondrial targeting of PrP."	"The four voltage-gated sodium channels SCN1/2/3/8A have been associated with heterogeneous types of developmental disorders, each presenting with disease specific temporal and cell type specific gene expression. Using single-cell RNA sequencing transcriptomic data from humans and mice, we observe that SCN1A is predominantly expressed in inhibitory neurons. In contrast, SCN2/3/8A are profoundly expressed in excitatory neurons with SCN2/3A starting prenatally, followed by SCN1/8A neonatally. In contrast to previous observations from low resolution RNA screens, we observe that all four genes are expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, however, exhibit differential expression strength. These findings provide molecular evidence, at single-cell resolution, to support the hypothesis that the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neuronal expression ratios of sodium channels are important regulatory mechanisms underlying brain homeostasis and neurological diseases. Modulating the E/I expression balance within cell types of sodium channels could serve as a potential strategy to develop targeted treatment for Na<sub>V</sub>-associated neuronal developmental disorders."	"Pathogenic variants in SCN2A are reported in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures, episodic ataxia, and autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability with and without seizures. To date, more than 300 patients with SCN2A variants have been published, the majority presenting with epilepsy. Large cohort studies and variant-specific electrophysiology, have enabled the delineation of different SCN2A-epilepsy phenotypes, phenotype-genotype correlations, prediction of pharmacosensitivity to sodium channel blockers and long-term prognostication for clinicians and families. Herein, we summarise the core phenotypes of SCN2A-related epilepsy, genotype-phenotype correlations, response to medication and future research."	"Pathogenic variants in the SCN2A gene are associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental phenotypes, defined in recent years through multicenter collaboration. Phenotypes include benign (self-limited) neonatal and infantile epilepsy and more severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies also presenting in early infancy. There is increasing evidence that an important phenotype linked to the gene is autism and intellectual disability without epilepsy or with rare seizures in later childhood. Other associations of SCN2A include the movement disorders chorea and episodic ataxia. It is likely that as genetic testing enters mainstream practice that new phenotypic associations will be identified. Some missense, gain of function variants tend to present in early infancy with epilepsy, whereas other missense or truncating, loss of function variants present with later-onset epilepsies or intellectual disability only. Knowledge of both mutation type and functional consequences can guide precision therapy. Sodium channel blockers may be effective antiepileptic medications in gain of function, neonatal and infantile presentations."	"Variants in the SCN2A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub> 1.2, cause a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes with different severity ranging from self-limiting epilepsies with early onset to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with early or late onset and intellectual disability (ID), as well as ID or autism without seizures. Functional analysis of channel defects demonstrated a genotype-phenotype correlation and suggested effective treatment options for one group of affected patients carrying gain-of-function variants. Here, we sum up the functional mechanisms underlying different phenotypes of patients with SCN2A channelopathies and present currently available models that can help in understanding SCN2A-related disorders."	"SCN1A, encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the sodium channel, is associated with several epilepsy syndromes and a range of other diseases. SCN1A represents the archetypal channelopathy associated with a wide phenotypic spectrum of epilepsies ranging from genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). SCN1A disorders also result in other diseases such as hemiplegic migraine and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dravet syndrome (DS) is the prototypic DEE with an early onset of febrile status epilepticus, hemiclonic or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and later onset of additional seizure types. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are normal at onset. Development is normal in the first year of life but plateaus rapidly, with most patients ultimately having intellectual disability. Epilepsy is drug-resistant and necessitates polytherapy. Most pathogenic variants occur de novo in the affected child, but they are inherited from mosaic affected or unaffected parents in rare cases. The molecular finding of haploinsufficiency is consistent with a loss-of-function defect in cells and animal models. Although seizures are the most commonly reported symptom in DS, many additional issues critically affect patients' cognitive and behavioral functioning. Hemiplegic migraine (HM) is a rare form of migraine with aura, characterized by the emergence of hemiparesis as part of the aura phase. All SCN1A mutations reported in sporadic/familial HM3 are missense mutations. Most of the experimental results show that they cause a gain of function of Na<sub>V</sub> 1.1 as opposed to the loss of function of the epileptogenic Na<sub>V</sub> 1.1 mutations. SCN1A and SCN2A pathogenic variants have been identified in genetic studies of cohorts of patients with ASD. In addition, ASD features are often reported in patients with Dravet syndrome and other DEEs."	"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play a crucial role in generation of action potentials. Pathogenic variants in the five human brain expressed VGSC genes, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A and SCN1B have been associated with a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the last decade, next generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized the way we diagnose these channelopathies, which is paving the way towards precision medicine. Knowing the functional effect (Loss-of-function versus Gain-of-function) of a variant is not only important for understanding the underlying pathophysiology, but it is particularly crucial to orient therapeutic decisions. Here we provide a review of the literature dealing with treatment options in epilepsy-related sodium channelopathies, including the current and emerging medications."	"The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has led to a redefining of the genetic landscape of the epilepsies. Hundreds of single gene epilepsies have been described. Genes associated with epilepsy involve diverse processes. Now a substantial proportion of individuals with epilepsy can receive a high definition molecular genetic diagnosis.In this review we update the current genetic landscape of the epilepsies and categorise the major functional groupings of epilepsy-associated genes. We describe currently available genetic testing approaches. We perform a literature review of NGS studies and review the factors which determine yield in cohorts undergoing testing. We identify factors associated with positive genetic diagnosis and consider the utility of genetic testing in terms of treatment selection as well as more qualitative aspects of care.Epilepsy-associated genes can be grouped into five broad functional categories: ion transport; cell growth and differentiation; regulation of synaptic processes; transport and metabolism of small molecules within and between cells; and regulation of gene transcription and translation. Early onset of seizures, drug-resistance, and developmental comorbidity are associated with higher diagnostic yield. The most commonly implicated genes in NGS studies to date, in order, are SCN1A, KCNQ2, CDKL5, SCN2A, and STXBP1. In unselected infantile cohorts PRRT2, a gene associated with self-limited epilepsy, is frequently implicated. Genetic diagnosis provides utility in terms of treatment choice closing the diagnostic odyssey, avoiding unnecessary further testing, and informing future reproductive decisions.Genetic testing has become a first line test in epilepsy. As techniques improve and understanding advances, its utility is set to increase. Genetic diagnosis, particularly in early onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, influences treatment choice in a significant proportion of patients. The realistic prospect of gene therapy is a cause for optimism."	"Prion diseases are fatal infectious neurodegenerative disorders in human and animals that are caused by misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into the infectious isoform PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. No effective treatment is available for prion diseases. Metformin is a first-line medication for treatment of type 2 diabetes which is known to activate AMPK and induce autophagy through the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR1) signaling. Metformin was reported to be beneficial in various protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. In this study we investigated the anti-prion effect of metformin in persistently prion-infected neuronal cells. Our data showed that metformin significantly decreased the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> load in the treated cells, as shown by less PK resistant PrP in Western blots and reduced prion conversion activity in Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay in both 22L-ScN2a and RML-ScCAD5 cells. Additionally, metformin induced autophagy as shown by higher levels of LC3-II in treated cells compared with control cells. On the other hand, our mouse bioassay showed that oral metformin at a dose of 2 mg/ml in drinking water had no effect on the survival of prion-infected mice. In conclusion, our findings describe the anti-prion effect of metformin in two persistently prion-infected neuronal cell lines. This effect can be explained at least partially by the autophagy inducing activity of metformin. This study sheds light on metformin as an anti-prion candidate for the combination therapy of prion diseases."	NA	NA

"Dravet syndrome is caused by dominant loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A which cause reduced activity of Nav1.1 leading to lack of neuronal inhibition. On the other hand, gain-of-function mutations in SCN8A can lead to a severe epileptic encephalopathy subtype by over activating NaV1.6 channels. These observations suggest that Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 represent two opposing sides of the neuronal balance between inhibition and activation. Here, we hypothesize that Dravet syndrome may be treated by either enhancing Nav1.1 or reducing Nav1.6 activity. To test this hypothesis we generated and characterized a novel DS zebrafish model and tested new compounds that selectively activate or inhibit the human NaV1.1 or NaV1.6 channel respectively. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate two separate Scn1Lab knockout lines as an alternative to previous zebrafish models generated by random mutagenesis or morpholino oligomers. Using an optimized locomotor assay, spontaneous burst movements were detected that were unique to Scn1Lab knockouts and disappear when introducing human SCN1A mRNA. Besides the behavioral phenotype, Scn1Lab knockouts show sudden, electrical discharges in the brain that indicate epileptic seizures in zebrafish. Scn1Lab knockouts showed increased sensitivity to the GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazole and a reduction in whole organism GABA levels. Drug screenings further validated a Dravet syndrome phenotype. We tested the NaV1.1 activator AA43279 and two novel NaV1.6 inhibitors MV1369 and MV1312 in the Scn1Lab knockouts. Both type of compounds significantly reduced the number of spontaneous burst movements and seizure activity. Our results show that selective inhibition of NaV1.6 could be just as efficient as selective activation of NaV1.1 and these approaches could prove to be novel potential treatment strategies for Dravet syndrome and other (genetic) epilepsies. Compounds tested in zebrafish however, should always be further validated in other model systems for efficacy in mammals and to screen for potential side effects."

"Anoxic-epileptic seizures (AES) are rare outcomes of common childhood reflex anoxic syncope that trigger a true epileptic seizure. The term AES was coined by Stephenson in 1983, to differentiate these events from convulsive syncopes and the more common reflex anoxic syncopes. A genetic susceptibility for AES has been postulated; but, its molecular basis has up to now been elusive. We report here two illustrative cases and show the association of de novo SCN8A variants and AES. One of them had focal or generalized seizures and autonomic symptoms triggered by orthostatism; the second had breath-holding spells triggered by pain or exercise leading to tonic-clonic seizures; both had repeatedly normal EEGs and a family history of reflex syncope. The data of three additional AES patients further suggest, for the first time, a link between SCN8A pathogenic variants and AES. The neurodevelopment of four patients was abnormal. Four of the five SCN8A mutations observed here were previously described in patients with seizure disorders. Seizures responded particularly well to sodium channel blockers. Our observation enriches the spectrum of seizures linked with SCN8A pathogenic variants."	"Gene therapy may provide a valuable alternative for recognized therapeutic approaches to specific types of epilepsy. Focal lesion appears to be best candidate's form of therapeutic approaches for epilepsies. Gene therapy has been explored to generate antiepileptogenic (determent of progress of epilepsy in subject at threat after having an epileptogenic injury), antiseizure (diminution of severity of seizures), and disease-modifying (modification of the instinctive history of the disease) effects. Advancement of innovative therapeutic alternatives, specifically those with the capability to be remedial is assured. Channelopathies are a divergent class of human derangements that are induced by mutation in such genes coding for channel-regulating proteins or ion channels. Considerable number of channelopathies have been described that associate both non-excitable cells along with electrically effective tissues like skeletal, brain and heart or the smooth muscle. Developments in structural biology (Design of ion channels facilitate us to justify how mutations may cause to channelopathies) has advanced significantly in modern time. Considerable number of new studies showing the significance of mutation in mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, NMDA receptors, GABA receptors, potassium channels, G-protein coupled receptors and chromatin alteration are identified. Illustration of meticulous drug in epilepsy targeting new expression of mutations in SCN8A, GRIN2A, GRIN2D and KCNT1 are confered. Possible causes for the dearth of examples of meticulous therapeutic agent for loss-of-function mutations are depicted. In this current review emphasized on how bilological information on genetics along with gene network investigations have indicated that route way disturbed in epilepsy imbricate with another neurodevelopmental character along with cognition. Analysis of gene network attempt hopes to explore contemporary route for epilepsy, to decode epilepsy's association to another neurodevelopmental features and to build a new way to epilepsy medicine disclosure."	"SCN8A encephalopathy is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) caused by de novo gain-of-function mutations of sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub> 1.6 that result in neuronal hyperactivity. Affected individuals exhibit early onset drug-resistant seizures, developmental delay, and cognitive impairment. This study was carried out to determine whether reducing the abundance of the Scn8a transcript with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) would delay seizure onset and prolong survival in a mouse model of SCN8A encephalopathy.ASO treatment was tested in a conditional mouse model with Cre-dependent expression of the pathogenic patient SCN8A mutation p.Arg1872Trp (R1872W). This model exhibits early onset of seizures, rapid progression, and 100% penetrance. An Scn1a <sup>+/-</sup> haploinsufficient mouse model of Dravet syndrome was also treated. ASO was administered by intracerebroventricular injection at postnatal day 2, followed in some cases by stereotactic injection at postnatal day 30.We observed a dose-dependent increase in length of survival from 15 to 65 days in the Scn8a-R1872W/+ mice treated with ASO. Electroencephalographic recordings were normal prior to seizure onset. Weight gain and activity in an open field were unaffected, but treated mice were less active in a wheel running assay. A single treatment with Scn8a ASO extended survival of Dravet syndrome mice from 3 weeks to &gt;5 months.Reduction of Scn8a transcript by 25 to 50% delayed seizure onset and lethality in mouse models of SCN8A encephalopathy and Dravet syndrome. Reduction of SCN8A transcript is a promising approach to treatment of intractable childhood epilepsies. Ann Neurol 2020;87:339-346."

In contrast to previous observations from low resolution RNA screens, we observe that all four genes are expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, however, exhibit differential expression strength. These findings provide molecular evidence, at single-cell resolution, to support the hypothesis that the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neuronal expression ratios of sodium channels are important regulatory mechanisms underlying brain homeostasis and neurological diseases. Modulating the E/I expression balance within cell types of sodium channels could serve as a potential strategy to develop targeted treatment for Na<sub>V</sub>-associated neuronal developmental disorders."	"Pathogenic variants in SCN8A have originally been described in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). However, recent studies have shown that SCN8A variants can be associated with a broader phenotypic spectrum, including the following: (1) Patients with early onset, severe DEE, developing severe cognitive and motor regression, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs, and cortical blindness. Severe SCN8A-DEE is characterized by intractable seizures beginning in the first months of life. The seizures are often prolonged focal hypomotor and occur in clusters, with prominent vegetative symptoms (apnea, cyanosis, mydriasis), evolving to clonic or bilateral tonic-clonic manifestations. Spasm-like episodes, cortical myoclonus, and recurrent episodes of status epilepticus are also common. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) show progressive background deterioration and multifocal abnormalities, predominant in the posterior regions. (2) Sporadic and familial patients with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, discrete neurological signs, and treatable epilepsy. EEG is abnormal in half of the cases, showing multifocal or diffuse epileptiform abnormalities. (3) Familial cases with benign infantile seizures, sometimes associated with paroxysmal dyskinesia later in life, with no other neurological deficits, normal cognition, and usually normal interictal EEG. (4) Patients without epilepsy but with cognitive and/or behavioral disturbances, or with movement disorders. Extrapyramidal features, such as dyskinesia, ataxia, and choreoathetosis are common in all groups. Early death has been reported in about 5% of the patients, most often in the subgroup of severe DEE. Premature death occurs during early childhood and often for causes other than sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. All epilepsy subgroups exhibit better seizure control with sodium channel blockers, usually at supratherapeutic doses in the severe cases. In severe SCN8A-DEE, ketogenic diet often has a good effect, whereas levetiracetam has a negative effect, if any. The familial SCN8A-related epilepsies show an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, whereas the vast majority of SCN8A-DEEs occur de novo."	"De novo mutations of the neuronal sodium channel SCN8A have been identified in approximately 2% of individuals with epileptic encephalopathy. These missense mutations alter the biophysical properties of sodium channel Nav1.6 in ways that lead to neuronal hyperexcitability. We generated two mouse models carrying patient mutations N1768D and R1872W to examine the effects on neuronal function in vivo. The conditional R1872W mutation is activated by expression of CRE recombinase, permitting characterization of the effects of the mutation on different classes of neurons and at different points in postnatal development. Preclinical drug testing in these mouse models provides support for several new therapies for this devastating disorder. In contrast with the gain-of-function mutations in epilepsy, mutations of SCN8A that result in partial or complete loss of function are associated with intellectual disability and other disorders."	"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play a crucial role in generation of action potentials. Pathogenic variants in the five human brain expressed VGSC genes, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A and SCN1B have been associated with a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the last decade, next generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized the way we diagnose these channelopathies, which is paving the way towards precision medicine. Knowing the functional effect (Loss-of-function versus Gain-of-function) of a variant is not only important for understanding the underlying pathophysiology, but it is particularly crucial to orient therapeutic decisions. Here we provide a review of the literature dealing with treatment options in epilepsy-related sodium channelopathies, including the current and emerging medications."	"We endeavored to evaluate a cohort of patients diagnosed with SCN8A-related epilepsy in a multi-disciplinary clinic and to create a bio-repository.We recruited patients with epilepsy due to SCN8A variants at Children's National Medical Center, through family organizations, or SCN8A.net. Study procedures included medical record review, review of EEG and MRI data, clinical evaluation, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3), DNA extraction, and preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Seventeen patients (9 months - 19 years) completed the study. Age at seizure onset was 1 day to 4 years old (median age 4 months). Epilepsy phenotype ranged from mild epilepsy to severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Medications targeting the voltage-gated sodium channel were most often effective, while levetiracetam resulted in worsening seizures and/or developmental regression in 7/16 (p &lt; 0.05). VABS-3 scores were below age expectations for most children; older children had lower scores. Neurological examination revealed hypotonia (13), spastic quadriparesis (1), ataxia (9), dyskinesia (2)/ dystonia (7), and four non-ambulatory.This is the first report of a large series of patients with epilepsy due to SCN8A variants evaluated in a single multi-disciplinary clinic. By utilizing a more comprehensive and consistent evaluation, we clarify specific seizure and epilepsy types, describe a distinct epilepsy phenotype in a patient with a nonsense variant, delineate patterns of developmental delay, language, and swallow function (specifically anomic aphasia and flaccid dysarthria), identify and characterize movement disorders, report common findings on physical exam, and demonstrate clinical worsening with levetiracetam."	"In multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS, the Nav1.6 voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel isoform has been implicated as a primary contributor to axonal degeneration. Following demyelination Nav1.6, which is normally co-localized with the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX) at the nodes of Ranvier, associates with β-APP, a marker of neural injury. The persistent influx of sodium through Nav1.6 is believed to reverse the function of NCX, resulting in an increased influx of damaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. However, direct evidence for the role of Nav1.6 in axonal degeneration is lacking.In mice floxed for Scn8a, the gene that encodes the α subunit of Nav1.6, subjected to EAE we examined the effect of eliminating Nav1.6 from retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in one eye using an AAV vector harboring Cre and GFP, while using the contralateral either injected with AAV vector harboring GFP alone or non-targeted eye as control.In retinas, the expression of Rbpms, a marker for retinal ganglion cells, was found to be inversely correlated to the expression of Scn8a. Furthermore, the gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Il6 (IL-6) and Ifng (IFN-γ), and of the reactive gliosis marker Gfap (GFAP) were found to be reduced in targeted retinas. Optic nerves from targeted eyes were shown to have reduced macrophage infiltration and improved axonal health.Taken together, our results are consistent with Nav1.6 promoting inflammation and contributing to axonal degeneration following demyelination."	"Mutations in the SCN8A gene cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. We characterize a new epilepsy-related SCN8A mutation, R850Q, in the human SCN8A channel and present gain-of-function properties of the mutant channel. Systematic comparison of R850Q with three other SCN8A epilepsy mutations, T761I, R1617Q and R1872Q, identifies one common dysfunction in resurgent current, although these mutations alter distinct properties of the channel. Computational simulations in two different neuron models predict an increased excitability of neurons carrying these mutations, which explains the over-excitation that underlies seizure activities in patients. These data provide further insight into the mechanism of SCN8A-related epilepsy and reveal subtle but potentially important distinction of functional characterization performed in the human vs. rodent channels.SCN8A is a novel causal gene for early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. It is well accepted that gain-of-function mutations in SCN8A underlie the disorder, although the remarkable heterogeneity of its clinical presentation and poor treatment response demand a better understanding of the disease mechanisms. Here, we characterize a new epilepsy-related SCN8A mutation, R850Q, in human Nav1.6. We show that it is a gain-of-function mutation, with a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependence of activation, a two-fold increase of persistent current and a slowed decay of resurgent current. We systematically compare its biophysics with three other SCN8A epilepsy mutations, T767I, R1617Q and R1872Q, in the human Nav1.6 channel. Although all of these mutations are gain-of-function, the mutations affect different aspects of channel properties. One commonality that we discovered is an alteration of resurgent current kinetics, although the mechanisms by which resurgent currents are augmented remain unclear for all of the mutations. Computational simulations predict an increased excitability of neurons carrying these mutations with differential enhancement by open channel blockade."	"Fetal akinesia has multiple clinical subtypes with over 160 gene associations, but the genetic etiology is not yet completely understood.In this study, 51 patients from 47 unrelated families were analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques aiming to decipher the genomic landscape of fetal akinesia (FA).We have identified likely pathogenic gene variants in 37 cases and report 41 novel variants. Additionally, we report putative pathogenic variants in eight cases including nine novel variants. Our work identified 14 novel disease-gene associations for fetal akinesia: ADSSL1, ASAH1, ASPM, ATP2B3, EARS2, FBLN1, PRG4, PRICKLE1, ROR2, SETBP1, SCN5A, SCN8A, and ZEB2. Furthermore, a sibling pair harbored a homozygous copy-number variant in TNNT1, an ultrarare congenital myopathy gene that has been linked to arthrogryposis via Gene Ontology analysis.Our analysis indicates that genetic defects leading to primary skeletal muscle diseases might have been underdiagnosed, especially pathogenic variants in RYR1. We discuss three novel putative fetal akinesia genes: GCN1, IQSEC3 and RYR3. Of those, IQSEC3, and RYR3 had been proposed as neuromuscular disease-associated genes recently, and our findings endorse them as FA candidate genes. By combining NGS with deep clinical phenotyping, we achieved a 73% success rate of solved cases."	"We aim to delineate the genetic and clinical features of SCN8A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.Nine patients with SCN8A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy were included in this study. Genetic and clinical features and effectiveness of sodium channel blockers were assessed in patients who were confirmed with SCN8A mutations.The onset of seizures ranged from the neonatal period to 18 months of age. Seizure types were diverse and predominantly involved focal seizures or spasms. The most common initial epilepsy syndrome was West syndrome in four patients, followed by neonatal-onset focal seizures in three patients and unclassified focal epilepsy in two patients. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) showed slow and disorganized background and epileptiform abnormalities with occipital predominance. Six patients presented intractable seizures including one patient with recurrent nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Sodium channel blockers were effective in seven patients among eight patients given them. All patients showed developmental delay or regression. Severe hypotonia or ataxia was also presented in some patients. Microcephaly was also characteristic. De novo missense mutations in SCN8A were found in the inactivation gate, C-terminal, loop 2, and transmembrane segments (S1, 4, 5, and 6). There was no correlation between the location of the mutation in the protein and phenotype or response to sodium channel blockers.SCN8A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy presents intractable seizures including spasms, focal seizures, neonatal status epilepticus, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Sodium channel blockers were effective irrelevant to the location of the mutation in the protein."	"Lymph node metastasis is a key factor in predicting and determining the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Sodium channels are highly expressed in a variety of tumors and are closely related to tumor development, metastasis, and invasion. We investigated the relationship between the expressions of different subtypes of Nav channels and lymph node metastasis of CRC.Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out to measure the expressions of different sodium channel subtypes, chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR4, CCR7), and lymphocyte infiltration-related biomarkers (CD3e, CD8a, IL-2RA) in CRC tissues from 97 patients. The expressions of Nav1.5 and Nav1.6 in surgically isolated lymph nodes were detected by immunohistochemistry. Correlation analysis between expressions of different genes and lymph node metastasis was performed by two-tailed t test.Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 were highly expressed in CRC tissues and positively correlated with CRC lymph node metastasis. Nav1.6 was also highly expressed in metastatic lymph nodes. Further analysis showed that the high expression of Nav1.6 was closely related to the one of CCR2\CCR4 in tumor lymph node metastasis.These results suggested that Nav1.6 might be a novel marker for CRC lymph node metastasis."	"Epilepsy is a complex disorder caused by various factors, including genetic aberrance. Recent studies have identified an essential role of the sodium channel Nav1.6, encoded by the gene SCN8A, in epileptic encephalopathy.Using parent-offspring trio targeted-exome sequencing, we identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation c.3953A &gt; G (p.N1318S) in SCN8A in a 3-year-and-9-month Chinese female patient with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and a normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.This de novo mutation was only detected in the patient but not in her parents. Bioinformatic analysis indicates the pathogenicity of this mutation. Administration of the sodium channel blocker well controlled seizures in the patient. Therefore, we recommend trio targeted-exome sequencing as a routine method for pathogenic variant screening in patients with intractable epilepsy and a normal MRI."	"Monoallelic de novo gain-of-function variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN8A are one of the recurrent causes of severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In addition, a small number of de novo or inherited monoallelic loss-of-function variants have been found in patients with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, or movement disorders. Inherited monoallelic variants causing either gain or loss-of-function are also associated with less severe conditions such as benign familial infantile seizures and isolated movement disorders. In all three categories, the affected individuals are heterozygous for a SCN8A variant in combination with a wild-type allele. In the present study, we describe two unusual families with severely affected individuals who inherited biallelic variants of SCN8A.We identified two families with biallelic SCN8A variants by diagnostic gene panel sequencing. Functional analysis of the variants was performed using voltage clamp recordings from transfected ND7/23 cells.We identified three probands from two unrelated families with DEE due to biallelic SCN8A variants. Each parent of an affected individual carried a single heterozygous SCN8A variant and exhibited mild cognitive impairment without seizures. In both families, functional analysis demonstrated segregation of one allele with complete loss-of-function, and one allele with altered biophysical properties consistent with partial loss-of-function.These studies demonstrate that SCN8A DEE may, in rare cases, result from inheritance of two variants, both of which exhibit reduced channel activity. In these families, heterozygosity for the dominant variants results in less severe disease than biallelic inheritance of two variant alleles. The clinical consequences of variants with partial and complete loss of SCN8A function are variable and likely to be influenced by genetic background."	"Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN8A cause a broad range of human diseases, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, and ataxia. Here we describe three mouse lines on the C57BL/6J background with novel, overlapping mutations in the Scn8a DIIS4 voltage sensor: an in-frame 9 bp deletion (Δ9), an in-frame 3 bp insertion (∇3) and a 35 bp deletion that results in a frameshift and the generation of a null allele (Δ35). Scn8a <sup>Δ9/+</sup> and Scn8a <sup>∇3/+</sup> heterozygous mutants display subtle motor deficits, reduced acoustic startle response, and are resistant to induced seizures, suggesting that these mutations reduce activity of the Scn8a channel protein, Na<sub>v</sub> 1.6. Heterozygous Scn8a <sup>Δ35/+</sup> mutants show no alterations in motor function or acoustic startle response, but are resistant to induced seizures. Homozygous mutants from each line exhibit premature lethality and severe motor impairments, ranging from uncoordinated gait with tremor (Δ9 and ∇3) to loss of hindlimb control (Δ35). Scn8a <sup>Δ9/Δ9</sup> and Scn8a <sup>∇3/∇3</sup> homozygous mutants also exhibit impaired nerve conduction velocity, while normal nerve conduction was observed in Scn8a <sup>Δ35/Δ35</sup> homozygous mice. Our results suggest that hypomorphic mutations that reduce Na<sub>v</sub> 1.6 activity will likely result in different clinical phenotypes compared to null alleles. These three mouse lines represent a valuable opportunity to examine the phenotypic impacts of hypomorphic and null Scn8a mutations without the confound of strain-specific differences."	NA
"SHANK2"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Epithelial cells establish apicobasal polarity by forming tight junctions (TJs) at the apical-lateral boundary, which play fundamental roles in physiological functions. An evolutionarily conserved atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-partitioning defective (PAR) complex functions as a platform for TJ assembly during cell polarity establishment. However, how this complex converts the spatial cues into a subsequent active unit is unclear. Here, we identify an epithelial isoform of Shank2 as a mediator of the aPKC-PAR complex. Shank2 binds to and colocalizes with aPKC at apical junctional regions of polarized epithelial cells. Shank2 knockdown results in defects in TJ formation. Mechanistically, we find that the N-terminal SPN domain is required for the junctional localization of Shank2 and binds to the active form of Rap1 small GTPase, which is involved in TJ formation. Our findings suggest that a close physical and functional relationship between aPKC and Shank2-active Rap1 signaling serves as the platform for TJ assembly to regulate epithelial cell polarity."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that are highly heterogeneous in clinical symptoms as well as etiologies. Mutations in SHANK2 are associated with ASD and accordingly, Shank2 knockout mouse shows ASD-like behavioral phenotypes, including social deficits. Intriguingly, two lines of Shank2 knockout (KO) mouse generated by deleting different exons (exon 6-7 or exon 7) showed distinct cellular phenotypes. Previously, we compared gene expressions between Shank2 KOs lacking exon 6-7 (e6-7 KO) and KOs lacking exon 7 (e7 KO) by performing RNA-seq. In this study, we expanded transcriptomic analyses to identify novel transcriptional variants in the KO mice. We found prominent expression of a novel exon (exon 4' or e4') between the existing exons 4 and 5 in the Shank2 e6-7 KO model. Expression of the transcriptional variant harboring this novel exon was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blotting. These findings suggest that the novel variant may function as a modifier gene, which contributes to the differences between the two Shank2 mutant lines. Furthermore, our result further represents an example of genetic compensation that may lead to phenotypic heterogeneity among ASD patients with mutations in the same gene."	"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive cancer with one of the highest world incidences in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa. Several genome wide studies have been performed on ESCC cohorts from Asian countries, North America, Malawi and other parts of the world but none have been conducted on ESCC tumors from South Africa to date, where the molecular pathology and etiology of this disease remains unclear. We report here tumor associated copy number changes observed in 51 ESCC patients' samples from the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.We extracted tumor DNA from 51 archived ESCC specimens and interrogated tumor associated DNA copy number changes using Affymetrix® 500 K SNP array technology. The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC 2.0) algorithm was applied to identify significant focal regions of gains and losses. Gains of the top recurrent cancer genes were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and their protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry.Twenty-three significant focal gains were identified across samples. Gains involving the CCND1, MYC, EGFR and JAG1 loci recapitulated those described in studies on Asian and Malawian cohorts. The two most significant gains involved the chromosomal sub-bands 3q28, encompassing the TPRG1 gene and 11q13.3 including the CTTN, PPFIA1and SHANK2 genes. There was no significant homozygous loss and the most recurrent hemizygous deletion involved the B3GAT1 gene on chromosome 11q25. Focal gains on 11q13.3 in 37% of cases (19/51), consistently involved CTTN and SHANK2 genes. Twelve of these cases (23,5%), had a broader region of gain that also included the CCND1, FGF19, FGF4 and FGF3 genes. SHANK2 and CTTN are co-amplified in several cancers, these proteins interact functionally together and are involved in cell motility. Immunohistochemistry confirmed both Shank2 (79%) and cortactin (69%) protein overexpression in samples with gains of these genes. In contrast, cyclin D1 (65%) was moderately expressed in samples with CCND1 DNA gain.This study reports copy number changes in a South African ESCC cohort and highlights similarities and differences with cohorts from Asia and Malawi. Our results strongly suggest a role for CTTN and SHANK2 in the pathogenesis of ESCC in South Africa."	"Homeostatic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity where individual synapses scale their strengths to compensate for global suppression or elevation of neuronal activity. This process can be studied by measuring miniature EPSP (mEPSP) amplitudes and frequencies following the regulation of activity in neuronal cultures. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative approach to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling using immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or bicuculline to extract scaling factors for various synaptic proteins. This approach allowed us to directly examine the scaling of presynaptic and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules along with neurotransmitter receptors in primary cultures from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. We show robust multiplicative scaling of synaptic scaffolding molecules namely, Shank2, PSD95, Bassoon, and AMPA receptor subunits and quantify their scaling factors. We use super-resolution microscopy to calculate scaling factors of surface expressed GluA2 within functional zones of the synapse and show that there is differential and correlated scaling of GluA2 levels within the spine, the postsynaptic density (PSD), and the perisynaptic regions. Our method opens a novel paradigm to quantify relative molecular changes of synaptic proteins within distinct subsynaptic compartments from a large number of synapses in response to alteration of neuronal activity, providing anatomic insights into the intricacies of variability in strength of individual synapses."	"The Jianchang duck is mainly distributed in Southwest China, and has the characteristics of fast growth rate and strong abilities in lipid deposition in the liver. In order to investigate the effects of domestication process on formation of the unique characteristics of Jianchang duck, the whole genome of sixteen individuals and three pooling of Jianchang duck were re-sequenced, and genome data of 70 mallards and 83 domestic ducks from thirteen different places in China were obtained from NCBI. The population stratification and evolution analysis showed gene exchanges existed between the Jianchang and other domestic duck populations, as well as Jianchang ducks and mallards. Genomic comparison between mallards and Jianchang ducks showed genes, including <i>CNTN1</i>, <i>CHRNA9</i>, and <i>SHANK2</i>, which is involved in brain and nerve development, experienced strong positive selection in the process of Jianchang duck domestication. The genomic comparison between Jianchang and domestic duck populations showed that <i>HSD17B12</i> and <i>ESM1</i>, which affect lipid metabolism, experienced strong positive selection during the domestication process. <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis among populations of Jianchang duck with different plumage colors indicated that <i>MITF</i> was related to the phenotype of a white feather, while <i>MC1R</i> was related to the phenotype of hemp feather. Our results provided a base for the domestication process of Jianchang duck and the genomic genes for unique traits."	"Cortactin regulates actin polymerization and stabilizes branched actin network. In neurons, cortactin is enriched in dendritic spines that contain abundant actin polymers. To explore the function of cortactin in dendritic spines, we examined spine morphology and dynamics in cultured neurons taken from cortactin knockout (KO) mice. Histological analysis revealed that the density and morphology of dendritic spines were not significantly different between wild-type (WT) and cortactin KO neurons. Time-lapse imaging of hippocampal slice cultures showed that the extent of spine volume change was similar between WT and cortactin KO neurons. Despite little effect of cortactin deletion on spine morphology and dynamics, actin turnover in dendritic spines was accelerated in cortactin KO neurons. Furthermore, we detected a suppressive effect of cortactin KO on spine head size under the condition of excessive spine enlargement induced by overexpression of a prominent postsynaptic density protein Shank2. These results suggest that cortactin may have a role in maintaining actin organization by stabilizing actin filaments near the postsynaptic density."	"To explore susceptibility genes for autism spectrum disorders (ASD).Whole-exome sequencing was carried out for 60 family trios affected with sporadic ASD. Genetic variants discovered in over 10% of the patients were selected for genotype-phenotype correlation and pathway enrichment analysis using Phenolyzer software and metascape database. Combining gene-phenotypic scores, pathway-related genes associated with neural and neurite triggering were screened for the candidates.A total of 170 common variants were found to be associated with the ASD phenotype. Among these, there was only one high-confidence gene [SHANK2(0.8146)] and four medium-confidence genes [ERBB2(0.1322), LAMC3(0.1117), PPFIA4(0.1059), DISC1(0.1002)]. Twenty-pathways and four biological processes were found to be statistically significant by pathway enrichment analysis, which included neuron projection morphogenesis (GO: 0048812), regulation of neuroblast proliferation (GO: 1902692), modulation of excitatory postsynaptic potential (GO: 0098815), and dendrite morphogenesis (GO: 0048813). Twenty-one genes were found to be closely associated with neurological and neurite triggering, among which only SHANK2, ERBB2, and DISC1 had above-medium confidence correlation scores with the ASD phenotypes.Abnormal neuron projection morphogenesis (GO: 0048812) may be closely related to the occurrence of ASD. SHANK2, ERBB2, and DISC1 are susceptibility genes for ASD."	"CASK-interactive proteins, Caskin1 and Caskin2, are multidomain neuronal scaffold proteins. Recent data from Caskin1 knockout animals indicated only a mild role of Caskin1 in anxiety and pain perception. In this work, we show that deletion of both Caskins leads to severe deficits in novelty recognition and spatial memory. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a reduction in synaptic profiles and dendritic spine areas of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of double knockout mice. Loss of Caskin proteins impaired LTP induction in hippocampal slices, while miniature EPSCs in dissociated hippocampal cultures appeared to be unaffected. In cultured Caskin knockout hippocampal neurons, overexpressed Caskin1 was enriched in dendritic spine heads and increased the amount of mushroom-shaped dendritic spines. Chemically induced LTP (cLTP) mediated enlargement of spine heads was augmented in the knockout mice and was not influenced by Caskin1. Immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation confirmed that Shank2, a master scaffold of the postsynaptic density, and Caskin1 co-localized within the same complex. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors was specifically altered by Caskin deficiency and was not elevated by cLTP treatment further. Taken together, our results prove a previously unnoticed postsynaptic role of Caskin scaffold proteins and indicate that Caskins influence learning abilities via regulating spine morphology and AMPA receptor localisation."	"We report on a female patient who presented with severe intellectual disability and autistic behavior, dysmorphic features, orodental anomalies, and bilateral calcification of basal ganglia. Using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray, we have identified a de novo duplication of 11q13.1q22.1 involving the dosage sensitive genes FGF3 and FGF4, genes related to autosomal dominant disorders KMT5B, GAL, SPTBN2, and LRP5, susceptibility loci SCZD2, SLEH1, and SHANK2, mitochondrial genes NDUFV1, NDUFS8, and TMEM126B, and many loss of function genes, including PHOX2A, CLPB, MED17, B3GNT1, LIPT2, and CLPB. However, the duplication did not involve Ribonuclease H2, subunit C (RNASEH2C) which is considered to be located in the critical region for Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. In combination with the duplication at 11q13.1, a 1.849-Mb heterozygous duplication at 4q35.2 was also identified. Although this duplicated region does not contain causative genes related to brain calcification, the duplication at 4q35 was reported previously in a patient with basal ganglia calcification, coats' like retinopathy, and glomerulosclerosis. Our patient's presentation and genomic findings indicate that duplication of 4q35.2 could be a novel genetic cause of calcification of basal ganglia. Our report also underscores the clinical significance of rearrangements in 11q13.1q22.1 in the pathogenesis of basal ganglia calcification."	"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasingly known as a serious, worldwide public health concern. Sorafenib resistance is the main challenge faced by many advanced HCC patients. The specific mechanisms of sorafenib resistance remind unclear. In the current study, GEO2R was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sorafenib-resistant samples and the control group by using RNA-sequence analysis and analyzing dataset GSE109211. Next, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built to explore key targets proteins in sorafenib-resistant HCC. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) analysis was used to research the underlying roles of key proteins. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to display the effect of key proteins on overall survival in HCC. Western blotting was performed to detected resistance-related proteins and CCK-8 assay was employed to measured cell viability. In the present research, 164 sorafenib resistance-related DEGs in HCC were identified by using RNA-sequence analysis and analyzing the dataset GSE109211. GO analysis revealed DEGs were involved in regulating multiple biological processes and molecular functions. DYNLL2, H2AFJ, SHANK2, ZWILCH, CDC14A, IFT20, MTA3, SERPINA1 and TCF4 were confirmed as key genes in this process. Moreover, our study showed Akt signaling was aberrantly activated and inhibition of Akt signaling enhanced anti-tumor capacity of sorafenib in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Identification of the DEGs in sorafenib resistant HCC cells may further provide the new insights of underlying sorafenib-resistant mechanisms and offer latent targets for early diagnosis and new therapies to improve clinical efficacy for sorafenib-resistant HCC patients."	"Activation of postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) modulates neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, while deregulation of mGluR signaling has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Overstimulation of mGluRs is restricted by the rapid endocytosis of receptors after activation. However, how membrane trafficking of mGluRs at synapses is controlled remains poorly defined. We find that in hippocampal neurons, the agonist-induced receptor internalization of synaptic mGluR5 is significantly reduced in Shank knockdown neurons. This is rescued by the re-expression of wild-type Shanks, but not by mutants unable to bind Homer1b/c, Dynamin2, or Cortactin. These effects are paralleled by a reduction in synapses associated with an endocytic zone. Moreover, a mutation in SHANK2 found in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) similarly disrupts these processes. On the basis of these findings, we propose that synaptic Shank scaffolds anchor the endocytic machinery to govern the efficient trafficking of mGluR5 and to balance the surface expression of mGluRs to efficiently modulate neuronal functioning."	"Repeated exposure to the opioid agonist, oxycodone, can lead to addiction. Accumulating evidence has shown that oxytocin (OT), a neurohypophyseal neuropeptide, could reduce the abuse potential of drugs. Recent studies suggest that epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation are involved in neuroadaptations. The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of OT on oxycodone conditioned place preference (CPP) and the epigenetic mechanism of OT in the hippocampus. For induction of CPP, oxycodone (3.0 mg/kg, i. p.) was administrated to male Sprague-Dawley rats once every other day during an eight-day conditioning phase. Global 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) level was determined based on CPP procedure, including acquisition, expression, extinction and reinstatement. We also measured mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), ten-eleven translocations (Tets) and synaptic genes (Psd95, Shank2, Gap43, etc.), and determined synaptic density after restraint stress-induced reinstatement of oxycodone CPP. The results showed that OT (2.5 μg, i. c.v.) pretreatment specifically inhibited the CPP acquisition and expression, facilitated the CPP extinction, and abolished restraint stress-induced reinstatement of oxycodone CPP. OT markedly inhibited global 5-mC changes induced by oxycodone CPP in the four phases. Following restraint stress-induced reinstatement of oxycodone CPP, OT significantly increased mRNA levels of Dnmt1, decreased Tet1 mRNA, synaptic proteins and synaptic density in the hippocampus. Our study indicated that reversal of global DNA hypomethylation through OT could significantly attenuate the rewarding effects induced by oxycodone. Our results suggested that OT could be specific manipulation on oxycodone addiction."	"Inconsistent findings between laboratories are hampering scientific progress and are of increasing public concern. Differences in laboratory environment is a known factor contributing to poor reproducibility of findings between research sites, and well-controlled multisite efforts are an important next step to identify the relevant factors needed to reduce variation in study outcome between laboratories. Through harmonization of apparatus, test protocol, and aligned and non-aligned environmental variables, the present study shows that behavioral pharmacological responses in Shank2 knockout (KO) rats, a model of synaptic dysfunction relevant to autism spectrum disorders, were highly replicable across three research centers. All three sites reliably observed a hyperactive and repetitive behavioral phenotype in KO rats compared to their wild-type littermates as well as a dose-dependent phenotype attenuation following acute injections of a selective mGluR1 antagonist. These results show that reproducibility in preclinical studies can be obtained and emphasizes the need for high quality and rigorous methodologies in scientific research. Considering the observed external validity, the present study also suggests mGluR1 as potential target for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders."	"Normal brain development is highly dependent on the timely coordinated actions of genetic and environmental processes, and an aberration can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of co-occurring NDDs that affect between 3% and 5% of the world population, thus presenting a great challenge to society. This problem calls for the need to understand the pathobiology of these disorders and to design new therapeutic strategies. One approach towards this has been the development of multiple analogous mouse models. This review discusses studies conducted in the mouse models of five major monogenic causes of ID and ASDs: Fmr1, Syngap1, Mecp2, Shank2/3 and Neuroligins/Neurnexins. These studies reveal that, despite having a diverse molecular origin, the effects of these mutations converge onto similar or related aetiological pathways, consequently giving rise to the typical phenotype of cognitive, social and emotional deficits that are characteristic of ID and ASDs. This convergence, therefore, highlights common pathological nodes that can be targeted for therapy. Other than conventional therapeutic strategies such as non-pharmacological corrective methods and symptomatic alleviation, multiple studies in mouse models have successfully proved the possibility of pharmacological and genetic therapy enabling functional recovery."	"Preclinical studies of psychiatric disorders use animal models to investigate the impact of environmental factors or genetic mutations on complex traits such as decision-making and social interactions. Here, we introduce a method for the real-time analysis of the behaviour of mice housed in groups of up to four over several days and in enriched environments. The method combines computer vision through a depth-sensing infrared camera, machine learning for animal and posture identification, and radio-frequency identification to monitor the quality of mouse tracking. It tracks multiple mice accurately, extracts a list of behavioural traits of both individuals and the groups of mice, and provides a phenotypic profile for each animal. We used the method to study the impact of Shank2 and Shank3 gene mutations-mutations that are associated with autism-on mouse behaviour. Characterization and integration of data from the behavioural profiles of Shank2 and Shank3 mutant female mice revealed their distinctive activity levels and involvement in complex social interactions."	"Copy number variations (CNVs) represent one of the most common genomic alterations. This study aimed to evaluate the roles of genes within highly aberrant genome regions in the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). Exome sequencing data from 81 paired ESCC tissues were used to screen aberrant genomic regions. The associations between CNVs and gene expression were evaluated using gene expression data from the same individuals. Then, an RNA expression array profile from 119 ESCC samples was adopted for differential gene expression and prognostic analyses. Two independent ESCC cohorts with 315 subjects were further recruited to validate the prognostic value using immunohistochemistry tests. Finally, we explored the potential mechanism of our identified novel oncogene in ESCC. In total, 2003 genes with CNVs were observed, of which 76 genes showed recurrent CNVs in more than three samples. Among them, 32 genes were aberrantly expressed in ESCC tumor tissues and statistically correlated with CNVs. Strikingly, 4 (CTTN, SHANK2, INPPL1 and ANO1) of the 32 genes were significantly associated with the prognosis of ESCC patients. Patients with a positive expression of ANO1 had a poorer prognosis than ANO1 negative patients (overall survival rate: 42.91% versus 26.22% for ANO1-/+ samples, P &lt; 0.001). Functionally, ANO1 promoted ESCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion by activating transforming growth factor-β pathway. Knockdown of ANO1 significantly inhibited tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, ANO1 is a novel oncogene in ESCC and may serve as a prognostic biomarker for ESCC."	"Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by a strong sex difference, but the mechanisms behind sex-bias are not fully understood. DNA methylation plays important roles in regulating gene expression, ultimately impacting sexually different characteristics of the human brain. Most previous literature focused on DNA methylation alone without considering the regulatory network and its contribution to sex-bias of psychiatric disorders. Since DNA methylation acts in a complex regulatory network to connect genetic and environmental factors with high-order brain functions, we investigated the regulatory networks associated with different DNA methylation and assessed their contribution to the risks of psychiatric disorders. We compiled data from 1408 postmortem brain samples in 3 collections to identify sex-differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). We identified and replicated thousands of DMPs and DMRs. The DMR genes were enriched in neuronal related pathways. We extended the regulatory networks related to sex-differential methylation and psychiatric disorders by integrating methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), gene expression, and protein-protein interaction data. We observed significant enrichment of sex-associated genes in psychiatric disorder-associated gene sets. We prioritized 2080 genes that were sex-biased and associated with psychiatric disorders, such as NRXN1, NRXN2, NRXN3, FDE4A, and SHANK2. These genes are enriched in synapse-related pathways and signaling pathways, suggesting that sex-differential genes of these neuronal pathways may cause the sex-bias of psychiatric disorders."	"Imprinted genes uniquely drive and support fetoplacental growth by controlling the allocation of maternal resources to the fetus and affecting the newborn's growth. We previously showed that alterations of the placental imprinted gene expression are associated with suboptimal perinatal growth and respond to environmental stimuli including socio-economic determinants. At the same time, maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy (MPSP) has been shown to affect fetal growth. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that placental imprinted gene expression mediates the effects of MPSP on fetal growth in a well-characterized birth cohort, the Stress in Pregnancy (SIP) Study. We observed that mothers experiencing high MPSP deliver infants with lower birthweight (P=0.047). Among the 109 imprinted genes tested, we detected panels of placental imprinted gene expression of 23 imprinted genes associated with MPSP and 26 with birthweight. Among these genes, five imprinted genes (CPXM2, glucosidase alpha acid (GAA), GPR1, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (SHANK2) and THSD7A) were common to the two panels. In multivariate analyses, controlling for maternal age and education and gestational age at birth and infant gender, two genes, GAA and SHANK2, each showed a 22% mediation of MPSP on fetal growth. These data provide new insights into the role that imprinted genes play in translating the maternal stress message into a fetoplacental growth pattern."	"Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SHANK2 are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We generated cortical neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from neurotypic and ASD-affected donors. We developed sparse coculture for connectivity assays where SHANK2 and control neurons were differentially labeled and sparsely seeded together on a lawn of unlabeled control neurons. We observed increases in dendrite length, dendrite complexity, synapse number, and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These findings were phenocopied in gene-edited homozygous SHANK2 knockout cells and rescued by gene correction of an ASD SHANK2 mutation. Dendrite length increases were exacerbated by IGF1, TG003, or BDNF, and suppressed by DHPG treatment. The transcriptome in isogenic SHANK2 neurons was perturbed in synapse, plasticity, and neuronal morphogenesis gene sets and ASD gene modules, and activity-dependent dendrite extension was impaired. Our findings provide evidence for hyperconnectivity and altered transcriptome in SHANK2 neurons derived from ASD subjects."	NA
"SYNGAP1"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Loss-of-function SYNGAP1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and epilepsy. SYNGAP1 is a Ras GTPase-activating protein that underlies the formation and experience-dependent regulation of postsynaptic densities. The mechanisms that contribute to this proposed monogenic cause of intellectual disability and epilepsy remain unresolved.We established the phenotype of the epileptogenesis in a Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model using 24-hour video electroencephalography (vEEG)/electromyography recordings at advancing ages. We administered an acute low dose of perampanel, a Food and Drug Administration-approved AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist, during a follow-on 24-hour vEEG to investigate the role of AMPARs in Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the region- and location-specific differences in the expression of the GluA2 AMPAR subunit.A progressive worsening of the epilepsy with emergence of multiple seizure phenotypes, interictal spike frequency, sleep dysfunction, and hyperactivity was identified in Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice. Interictal spikes emerged predominantly during non-rapid eye movement sleep in 24-hour vEEG of Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice. Myoclonic seizures occurred at behavioral-state transitions both in Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice and during an overnight EEG from a child with SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency. In Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup> mice, EEG spectral power analyses identified a significant loss of gamma power modulation during behavioral-state transitions. A significant region-specific increase of GluA2 AMPAR subunit expression in the somas of parvalbumin-positive interneurons was identified.Acute dosing with perampanel significantly rescued behavioral state-dependent cortical gamma homeostasis, identifying a novel mechanism implicating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable AMPARs on parvalbumin-positive interneurons underlying circuit dysfunction in SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency."	"SynGAP is a potent regulator of biochemical signaling in neurons and plays critical roles in neuronal function. It was first identified in 1998, and has since been extensively characterized as a mediator of synaptic plasticity. Because of its involvement in synaptic plasticity, SynGAP has emerged as a critical protein for normal cognitive function. In recent years, mutations in the <i>SYNGAP1</i> gene have been shown to cause intellectual disability in humans and have been linked to other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. While the structure and biochemical function of SynGAP have been well characterized, a unified understanding of the various roles of SynGAP at the synapse and its contributions to neuronal function remains to be achieved. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current understanding of the multifactorial role of SynGAP in regulating neuronal function gathered over the last two decades."	"SynGAP is a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein that binds to PDZ domains of the scaffold protein PSD-95. We previously reported that heterozygous deletion of <i>Syngap1</i> in mice is correlated with increased steady-state levels of other key PSD proteins that bind PSD-95, although the level of PSD-95 remains constant (Walkup et al., 2016). For example, the ratio to PSD-95 of Transmembrane AMPA-Receptor-associated Proteins (TARPs), which mediate binding of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to PSD-95, was increased in young <i>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></i>mice. Here we show that only females and not males show a highly significant correlation between an increase in TARP and a decrease in synGAP in the PSDs of <i>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></i>rodents. The data reveal a sex difference in the adaptation of the PSD scaffold to synGAP haploinsufficiency."	"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are characterised by cognitive, social and motor deficits and are highly comorbid with intractable epilepsies. Through advances in genetic sequencing technologies a vast number of genes have been implicated in NDDs. State-of-the-art gene-editing techniques have led to the generation of hundreds of mouse models of NDDs. As an example, rodent models of Rett and Dravet syndromes as well as the syndromes caused by mutations in CDKL5 and Syngap1 display cognitive deficits in conjunction with seizure phenotypes. These models allow researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms as well as develop novel treatment strategies that can potentially be translated to the clinic. Furthermore, it may be possible to gain insights into the contribution of epilepsy to the progression of cognitive, social and motor phenotypes in NDDs."	"While genes with an excess of de novo mutations (DNMs) have been identified in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), few studies focus on DNM patterns where the sex of affected children is examined separately. We considered ∼8,825 sequenced parent-child trios (n ∼26,475 individuals) and identify 54 genes with a DNM enrichment in males (n = 18), females (n = 17), or overlapping in both the male and female subsets (n = 19). A replication cohort of 18,778 sequenced parent-child trios (n = 56,334 individuals) confirms 25 genes (n = 3 in males, n = 7 in females, n = 15 in both male and female subsets). As expected, we observe significant enrichment on the X chromosome for females but also find autosomal genes with potential sex bias (females, CDK13, ITPR1; males, CHD8, MBD5, SYNGAP1); 6.5% of females harbor a DNM in a female-enriched gene, whereas 2.7% of males have a DNM in a male-enriched gene. Sex-biased genes are enriched in transcriptional processes and chromatin binding, primarily reside in the nucleus of cells, and have brain expression. By downsampling, we find that DNM gene discovery is greatest when studying affected females. Finally, directly comparing de novo allele counts in NDD-affected males and females identifies one replicated genome-wide significant gene (DDX3X) with locus-specific enrichment in females. Our sex-based DNM enrichment analysis identifies candidate NDD genes differentially affecting males and females and indicates that the study of females with NDDs leads to greater gene discovery consistent with the female-protective effect."	"Selective anxiolytic fabomotizole (Afobazol®) has affinity for the Sigma-1 chaperone receptor site, quinone reductase 2 (NQO2) and MAO-A regulatory sites, and melatonin receptor type 1 (MT<sub>1</sub> receptor). The analysis of the effect of fabomotizole on the gene expression profile in the brain of MR (Maudsley Reactive) rats was carried out when modeling emotional stress in the open field test. A change in the expression of 14 genes was found, the results of the functional annotation of which showed that the mechanisms of action of fabomotizole may be associated with the regulation of translation of proteins (Rpl5, Rpl15, Ncl, and Ybx1), synaptic functions (Cplx2, Dlg4, Syngap1, Add1, Rab8b, Klc1, and Chn1), and cellular metabolism (Akr1d1, Bcat1, and Pkm)."	"The corticostriatal pathway that carries sensory, motor, and limbic information to the striatum plays a critical role in motor control, action selection, and reward. Dysfunction of this pathway is associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Corticostriatal synapses have unique features in their cortical origins and striatal targets. In this review, we first describe axonal growth and synaptogenesis in the corticostriatal pathway during development, and then summarize the current understanding of the molecular bases of synaptic transmission and plasticity at mature corticostriatal synapses. Genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been implicated in axonal growth abnormalities, imbalance of the synaptic excitation/inhibition ratio, and altered long-term synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. Here, we review a number of ASD-associated high-confidence genes, including FMR1, KMT2A, GRIN2B, SCN2A, NLGN1, NLGN3, MET, CNTNAP2, FOXP2, TSHZ3, SHANK3, PTEN, CHD8, MECP2, DYRK1A, RELN, FOXP1, SYNGAP1, and NRXN, and discuss their relevance to proper corticostriatal function."	"Aberrant RAS signaling activation is common in cancers with even few Ras mutations, indicating alternative dysregulation other than genetic mutations. We identified a Ras GTPase-activating gene RASA5/SYNGAP1, at the common 6p21.3 deletion, methylated/downregulated in multiple carcinomas and different from other RASA family members (RASA1-RASA4), indicating its special functions in tumorigenesis. RASA5 mutations are rare, unlike other RASA members, whereas its promoter CpG methylation is frequent in multiple cancer cell lines and primary carcinomas and associated with patient's poor survival. RASA5 expression inhibited tumor cell migration/invasion and growth in mouse model, functioning as a tumor suppressor. RASA5 suppressed RAS signaling, depending on its Ras GTPase-activating protein catalytic activity, which could be counteracted by oncogenic HRas Q61L mutant. RASA5 knockdown enhanced Ras signaling to promote tumor cell growth. RASA5 also inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through regulating actin reorganization. Thus, epigenetic inactivation of RASA5 contributing to hyperactive RAS signaling is involved in Ras-driven human oncogenesis."	"SYNGAP1 is a gene that encodes the cytosolic protein SYNGAP1 (SYNaptic GTPase Activating Protein), an essential component of the postsynaptic density at excitatory glutamatergic neurons. SYNGAP1 plays critical roles in synaptic development, structure, function, and plasticity. Mutations in SYNGAP1 result in a neurodevelopmental disorder termed Mental retardation-type 5 (MRD5, OMIM #612621) with a phenotype consisting of intellectual disability, motor impairments, and epilepsy, attesting to the importance of this protein for normal brain development. Here we review the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of SYNGAP1 mutations with a focus on their effect on synaptogenesis, neural circuit function, and cellular plasticity. We conclude by comparing the molecular pathogenesis of SYNGAP1 mutations with those of another neurodevelopmental disorder that affects dendritic function and cellular plasticity, fragile X syndrome. Insights into the molecular similarities and differences underlying these disorders could lead to rationale therapy development."	"<b>Introduction</b>: Atypical absences are generalized epileptic seizures typically affecting children with severe epilepsies and learning difficulties along with other seizure types. Video-EEG is essential for their diagnosis. Recently, atypical absence seizures have been reported as a hallmark of some developmental and epileptic encephalopathies.<b>Areas covered</b>: This is a narrative review of the literature which describes the electroclinical features of atypical seizures, the characteristics of developmental epileptic encephalopathies in which this seizure type can occur, and the evidence supporting the use of individual antiseizure drugs for the treatment of atypical absences.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Treatment of absence seizures typically relies on ethosuximide (ineffective against tonic-clonic seizures), valproate (associated with larger proportion of adverse events), or lamotrigine (less effective than the other two). However, unlike typical absences, atypical absences are usually intractable, persist lifetime, and their prognosis depends on the underlying etiology or associated epilepsy syndrome. Besides efficacy, other relevant factors, such as drug formulation, ease of titration and dosing, and drug interactions, should be considered. Drugs that may worsen epilepsy, cognition and behavior should be avoided. In the vast majority of patients, a polytherapy is required, although usually with limited efficacy. Finally, epilepsy syndromes featuring atypical absences require a multidisciplinary approach."	"Although the genetic and clinical aspects of epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (MAE) and early onset absence epilepsy (EOAE) have been investigated thoroughly, other early childhood-onset generalized epilepsies that share clinical features with MAE and EOAE have not been characterized. In this study, we aimed to delineate the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of early childhood-onset generalized epilepsies, including MAE and EOAE.We recruited 61 patients diagnosed with MAE, EOAE, genetic epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (GEFS+) and unclassified generalized epilepsies that shared seizure onset age and seizure types. Genetic causes were investigated through targeted gene panel testing, whole exome sequencing, chromosomal microarray, and single-gene Sanger sequencing.We classified 11 patients with MAE, 20 with EOAE, 9 with GEFS + spectrum. Epilepsy syndrome was not specified in the remaining 21 patients. The clinical features were comparable across groups. Nevertheless, patients with EOAE tended to show better developmental and seizure outcomes. A total of 23 pathogenic sequences and copy number variants from 12 genes were identified (23/61, 37.7%). Genetic etiologies were confirmed in 36.4% (4/11) of the MAE group, 45% (9/20) of the EOAE group, 22.2% (2/9) of the GEFS + spectrum, and 38.1% (8/21) of the unclassified group. The most frequently identified genes with pathogenic variants were SLC6A1 (7 patients), SLC2A1 (4 patients), and SYNGAP1 (4 patients).Early childhood-onset generalized epilepsy appeared to be characterized by an overlapping genetic and phenotypic spectrum. SLC6A1 and SLC2A1 appeared to be important genetic causes of early childhood-onset generalized epilepsy."	"The SYNGAP1 gene encodes for a small GTPase-regulating protein critical to dendritic spine maturation and synaptic plasticity. Mutations have recently been identified to cause a breadth of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. The purpose of this work is to define the phenotypic spectrum of SYNGAP1 gene mutations and identify potential biomarkers of clinical severity and developmental progression.A retrospective clinical data analysis of individuals with SYNGAP1 mutations was conducted. Data included genetic diagnosis, clinical history and examinations, neurophysiologic data, neuroimaging, and serial neurodevelopmental/behavioral assessments. All patients were seen longitudinally within a 6-year period; data analysis was completed on June 30, 2018. Records for all individuals diagnosed with deleterious SYNGAP1 variants (by clinical sequencing or exome sequencing panels) were reviewed.Fifteen individuals (53% male) with seventeen unique SYNGAP1 mutations are reported. Mean age at genetic diagnosis was 65.9 months (28-174 months). All individuals had epilepsy, with atypical absence seizures being the most common semiology (60%). EEG abnormalities included intermittent rhythmic delta activity (60%), slow or absent posterior dominant rhythm (87%), and epileptiform activity (93%), with generalized discharges being more common than focal. Neuroimaging revealed nonspecific abnormalities (53%). Neurodevelopmental evaluation revealed impairment in all individuals, with gross motor function being the least affected. Autism spectrum disorder was diagnosed in 73% and aggression in 60% of cases. Analysis of biomarkers revealed a trend toward a moderate positive correlation between visual-perceptual/fine motor/adaptive skills and language development, with posterior dominant rhythm on electroencephalogram (EEG), independent of age. No other neurophysiology-development associations or correlations were identified.A broad spectrum of neurologic and neurodevelopmental features are found with pathogenic variants of SYNGAP1. An abnormal posterior dominant rhythm on EEG correlated with abnormal developmental progression, providing a possible prognostic biomarker."	"Disruption of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneuron migration is implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) promotes GABAergic interneuron migration, which is disrupted in various neurological disorders, some of which are also associated with mutations in the gene encoding synaptic Ras-guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (SynGAP). Here, we explored the mechanisms underlying these associations and their possible connection. In prenatal mouse brain tissue, we found a previously unknown interaction between the D1R and SynGAP. This D1R-SynGAP interaction facilitated D1R localization to the plasma membrane and promoted D1R-mediated downstream signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of protein kinase A and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These effects were blocked by a peptide (TAT-D1R<sub>pep</sub>) that disrupted the D1R-SynGAP interaction. Furthermore, disrupting this complex in mice during embryonic development resulted in pronounced and selective deficits in the tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons, possibly due to altered actin and microtubule dynamics. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating interneuron development and suggest that disruption of the D1R-SynGAP interaction may underlie <i>SYNGAP1</i> mutation-related neurodevelopmental disorders."	"Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (SYNGAP1) regulates synaptic plasticity through AMPA receptor trafficking. SYNGAP1 mutations have been found in human patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Almost every individual with SYNGAP1-related ID develops epilepsy, and approximately 50% have ASD. SYNGAP1-related ID is estimated to account for at least 1% of ID cases. In mouse models with Syngap1 mutations, strong cognitive and affective dysfunctions have been reported, yet some findings are inconsistent across studies. To further understand the behavioral significance of the SYNGAP1 gene, we assessed various domains of behavior in Syngap1 heterozygous mutant mice using a behavioral test battery.Male mice with a heterozygous mutation in the Syngap1 gene (Syngap1<sup>-/+</sup> mice) created by Seth Grant's group were subjected to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, which examined general health, and neurological screens, rotarod, hot plate, open field, light/dark transition, elevated plus maze, social interaction, prepulse inhibition, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, gait analysis, T-maze, Y-maze, Barnes maze, contextual and cued fear conditioning, and home cage locomotor activity. To control for type I errors due to multiple-hypothesis testing, P-values below the false discovery rate calculated by the Benjamini-Hochberg method were considered as study-wide statistically significant.Syngap1<sup>-/+</sup> mice showed increased locomotor activity, decreased prepulse inhibition, and impaired working and reference spatial memory, consistent with preceding studies. Impairment of context fear memory and increased startle reflex in Syngap1 mutant mice could not be reproduced. Significant decreases in sensitivity to painful stimuli and impaired motor function were observed in Syngap1<sup>-/+</sup> mice. Decreased anxiety-like behavior and depression-like behavior were noted, although increased locomotor activity is a potential confounding factor of these phenotypes. Increased home cage locomotor activity indicated hyperlocomotor activity not only in specific behavioral test conditions but also in familiar environments.In Syngap1<sup>-/+</sup> mice, we could reproduce most of the previously reported cognitive and emotional deficits. The decreased sensitivity to painful stimuli and impaired motor function that we found in Syngap1<sup>-/+</sup> mice are consistent with the common characteristics of patients with SYNGAP-related ID. We further confirmed that the Syngap1 heterozygote mouse recapitulates the symptoms of ID and ASD patients."	"To report on a child with mental retardation caused by SYNGAP1 gene mutation.Peripheral blood samples were collected from the proband and her parents. High throughput sequencing (HTS) was employed for screening for potential mutation in the patient. Suspected mutation was validated by Sanger sequencing of the child and her parents.By HTS, a previously unknown mutation [c.1656C&gt;A (p.C552*)] was found in exon 10 of the SYNGAP1 gene in the proband. Sanger sequencing confirmed the heterozygous nature of the mutation and that neither of her parents carried the same mutation.The dysmorphism and developmental delay of the child were probably due to the pathogenic mutation of the SYNGAP1 gene. HTS can facilitate elucidation of the genetic etiology with efficiency, which has great significance in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the child."	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
"CC2D1A"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder consistently show a male bias in prevalence, but it remains unclear why males and females are affected with different frequency. While many behavioral studies of transgenic NDD models have focused only on males, the requirement by the National Institutes of Health to consider sex as a biological variable has promoted the comparison of male and female performance in wild-type and mutant animals. Here, we review examples of rodent models of NDDs in which sex-specific deficits were identified in molecular, physiological, and/or behavioral responses, showing sex differences in susceptibility to disruption of genes mutated in NDDs. Haploinsufficiency in genes involved in mechanisms such as synaptic function (GABRB3 and NRXN1), chromatin remodeling (CHD8, EMHT1, and ADNP), and intracellular signaling (CC2D1A and ERK1) lead to more severe behavioral outcomes in males. However, in the absence of behavioral deficits, females can still present with cellular and electrophysiological changes that could be due to compensatory mechanisms or differential allocation of molecular and cellular functions in the two sexes. By contrasting these findings with mouse models where females are more severely affected (MTHFR and AMBRA1), we propose a framework to approach the study of sex-specific deficits possibly leading to sex bias in NDDs."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneously childhood neurodevelopmental disorder, believed to be under development of various genetic and environmental factors. Autophagy and related pathways have also been implicated in the etiology of ASD. We aimed to investigate autophagic markers by generating the transgenerational inheritance of ASD-like behaviors in the Cc2d1a animal model of ASD. Cc2d1a (+/-) mouse model of ASD was built in two different groups by following three generations. After behavior test, bilateral hippocampus was sliced. Western Blot assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) were used for measurement of LC3 and Beclin-1 as key regulators of autophagy. All of the animal and laboratory studies were conducted in the Erciyes University Genome and Stem Cell Center (GENKOK). Significant LC3 and Beclin-1 mRNA expression levels were observed in mouse hippocampus between groups and generations. Western blot confirmed the changes of the proteins in the hippocampus. LC3 expressions were increased for females and decreased for males compared to the control group. Beclin-1 expression levels were found to be significantly decreased in males and females compared to controls. This study could help explain a new pathway of autophagy in ASD mouse models. Future animal studies need to investigate sex differences in mouse modeling autism-relevant genes like CC2D1A. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for more comprehensive autophagy studies in this mouse model of ASD."	"Reproductive cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a valuable method to propagate service dogs with desirable traits because of higher selection rates in cloned dogs. However, incomplete reprogramming is a major barrier to SCNT, and the assessment of reprogramming is limited to preimplantation embryos and tissues from dead and/or adult tissue. Thus, lifelong monitoring in SCNT dogs can be useful to evaluate the SCNT service dogs for propagation. We applied microarray and qRT-PCR to profile of mRNA and miRNA in whole blood samples collected from four cloned dogs (S), three age-matched control dogs (A), and a donor dog (D). In the analysis of differentially expressed genes in S-A, A-D, and S-D pairs, most genomes were completely reprogrammed and rejuvenated in the cloned offspring. However, several RNAs were differentially expressed. Interestingly, the altered genes are associated with aging and senescence. Furthermore, we identified potential biomarkers such as mirR-223 (<i>NFIB</i>; <i>CLIC4</i>), miRN-494 (<i>ARHGEF12</i>), miR-106b (<i>PPP1R3B</i>; <i>CC2D1A</i>), miR-20a (<i>CC2D1A</i>; <i>PPP1R3B</i>), miR-30e (<i>IGJ</i>; <i>HIRA</i>), and miR-19a (<i>TNRC6A</i>) by miRNA-target mRNA pairing for monitoring rejuvenation, aging/senescence, and reprogramming in cloned dogs. The novel comparative transcriptomic information about SCNT and age-matched dogs can be used to assess the lifelong health of cloned dogs and to facilitate the selection of training animals with minimal invasive procedures."	"Recurrence within 6 months of the last round of chemotherapy is clinically defined as platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Gene expression associated with early recurrence may provide insights into platinum resistant recurrence. Prior studies identified a 14-gene model that accurately predicted early or late recurrence in 86% of patients. One of the genes identified was <i>CC2D1A</i> (encoding coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A), which showed higher expression in tumors from patients with early recurrence. Here, we show that CC2D1A protein expression was higher in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines compared to cisplatin-sensitive cell lines. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of patient tumors on a tissue microarray (<i>n</i> = 146) showed that high levels of CC2D1A were associated with a significantly worse overall and progression-free survival (<i>p</i> = 0.0002 and <i>p</i> = 0.006, respectively). To understand the contribution of CC2D1A in chemoresistance, we generated shRNA-mediated knockdown of CC2D1A in SKOV3ip and PEO4 cell lines. Cell death and clonogenic assays of these isogenic clonal lines clearly showed that downregulation of CC2D1A resulted in increased sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, nude mice bearing SKOV3ip xenografts with stably downregulated CC2D1A were more sensitive to chemotherapy as evidenced by a significantly longer survival time compared to xenografts derived from cells stably transduced with non-targeting shRNA. These results suggest CC2D1A promotes chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer."	"Malan syndrome is a recently introduced overgrowth disorder described in a limited number of individuals. Haploinsufficiency and also point mutations of NFIX gene have been proposed as its leading causative mechanism, however, due to the limited number of cases and different deletion sizes, genotype/phenotype correlations are still limited.Here, we report the first Brazilian case of Malan syndrome caused by a 990 kb deletion in 19p13.2p13.12, focusing on clinical and behavioral aspects of the syndrome.The patient presented with macrocephaly, facial dysmorphisms, hypotonia, developmental delay, moderate thoracolumbar scoliosis, and seizures. The intellectual and behavioral assessments showed severe cognitive, language, and adaptive functions impairments. The 19p deleted region of our patient encompasses NFIX, CACNA1A, which seems to be related to a higher frequency of seizures among individuals with microdeletions in 19p13.2, and 15 other coding genes, including CC2D1A and NACC1, both known to be involved in neurobiological process and pathways.Deletions involving NFIX gene should be considered in patients with overgrowth during childhood, macrocephaly, developmental delay, and seizures, as well as severe intellectual disability."	"Coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A) is an evolutionarily conserved protein, originally identified as a nuclear factor-κB activator through a large-scale screen of human genes. Mutations in the human <i>Cc2d1a</i> gene result in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic intellectual disability. It remains unclear, however, how <i>Cc2d1a</i> mutation leads to alterations in brain function. Here, we have taken advantage of Cre/loxP recombinase-based strategy to conditionally delete <i>Cc2d1a</i> exclusively from excitatory neurons of male mouse forebrain to examine its role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. We confirmed the expression of CC2D1A protein and mRNA in the mouse hippocampus. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that CC2D1A is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the adult hippocampus. Conditional deletion of <i>Cc2d1a</i> (cKO) from excitatory neurons leads to impaired performance in object location memory test and altered anxiety-like behavior. Consistently, cKO mice displayed a deficit in the maintenance of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. <i>Cc2d1a</i> deletion also resulted in decreased complexity of apical and basal dendritic arbors of CA1 pyramidal neurons. An enhanced basal Rac1 activity was observed following <i>Cc2d1a</i> deletion, and this enhancement was mediated by reduced SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) and SENP3 expression, thus increasing the amount of Rac1 SUMOylation. Furthermore, partial blockade of Rac1 activity rescued impairments in LTP and object location memory performance in cKO mice. Together, our results implicate Rac1 hyperactivity in synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits observed in <i>Cc2d1a</i> cKO mice and reveal a novel role for CC2D1A in regulating hippocampal synaptic function.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CC2D1A is abundantly expressed in the brain, but there is little known about its physiological function. Taking advantage of <i>Cc2d1a</i> cKO mice, the present study highlights the importance of CC2D1A in the maintenance of LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses and the formation of hippocampus-dependent long-term object location memory. Our findings establish a critical link between elevated Rac1 activity, structural and synaptic plasticity alterations, and cognitive impairment caused by <i>Cc2d1a</i> deletion. Moreover, partial blockade of Rac1 activity rescues synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in <i>Cc2d1a</i> cKO mice. Such insights may have implications for the utility of Rac1 inhibitors in the treatment of intellectual disability caused by <i>Cc2d1a</i> mutations in human patients."	"The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders is biased toward male individuals, with male-to-female ratios of 2:1 in intellectual disability and 4:1 in autism spectrum disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms of such bias remain unknown. While characterizing a mouse model for loss of the signaling scaffold coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1A (CC2D1A), which is mutated in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, we identified biochemical and behavioral differences between male and female mice, and explored whether CC2D1A controls male-specific intracellular signaling.CC2D1A is known to regulate phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), which regulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. We tested for activation of PDE4D and downstream signaling molecules in the hippocampus of Cc2d1a-deficient mice. We then performed behavioral studies in female mice to analyze learning and memory, and then targeted PDE4D activation with a PDE4D inhibitor to define how changes in cAMP levels affect behavior in male and female mice.We found that in Cc2d1a-deficient male mice PDE4D is hyperactive, leading to a reduction in cAMP response element binding protein signaling, but this molecular deficit is not present in female mice. Cc2d1a-deficient male mice show a deficit in spatial memory, which is not present in Cc2d1a-deficient female mice. Restoring PDE4D activity using an inhibitor rescues cognitive deficits in male mice but has no effect on female mice.Our findings show that CC2D1A regulates cAMP intracellular signaling in a male-specific manner in the hippocampus, leading to male-specific cognitive deficits. We propose that male-specific signaling mechanisms are involved in establishing sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders."	"The etiology of intellectual disability (ID) is heterogeneous including a variety of genetic and environmental causes. Historically, most research has not focused on autosomal recessive ID (ARID), which is a significant cause of ID, particularly in areas where parental consanguinity is common. Identification of genetic causes allows for precision diagnosis and improved genetic counseling. We performed whole exome sequencing to 21 Turkish families, seven multiplex and 14 simplex, with nonsyndromic ID. Based on the presence of multiple affected siblings born to unaffected parents and/or shared ancestry, we consider all families as ARID. We revealed the underlying causative variants in seven families in MCPH1 (c.427dupA, p.T143Nfs*5), WDR62 (c.3406C&gt;T, p.R1136*), ASPM (c.5219_5225delGAGGATA, p.R1740Tfs*7), RARS (c.1588A&gt;G, p.T530A), CC2D1A (c.811delG, p.A271Pfs*30), TUSC3 (c.793C&gt;T, p.Q265*) and ZNF335 (c.808C&gt;T, p.R270C and c.3715C&gt;A, p.Q1239K) previously linked with ARID. Besides ARID genes, in one family, affected male siblings were hemizygous for PQBP1 (c.459_462delAGAG, p.R153Sfs*41) and in one family the proband was female and heterozygous for X-chromosomal SLC9A6 (c.1631+1G&gt;A) variant. Each of these variants, except for those in MCPH1 and PQBP1, have not been previously published. Additionally in one family, two affected children were homozygous for the c.377G&gt;A (p.W126*) variant in the FAM183A, a gene not previously associated with ARID. No causative variants were found in the remaining 11 families. A wide variety of variants explain half of families with ARID. FAM183A is a promising novel candidate gene for ARID."	"Hundreds of genes are mutated in non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with each gene often involved in only a handful of cases. Such heterogeneity can be daunting, but rare recessive loss of function (LOF) mutations can be a good starting point to provide insight into the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disease. Biallelic LOF mutations in the signaling scaffold <i>CC2D1A</i> cause a rare form of autosomal recessive ID, sometimes associated with ASD and seizures. In parallel, we recently reported that <i>Cc2d1a</i>-deficient mice present with cognitive and social deficits, hyperactivity and anxiety. In Drosophila, loss of the only ortholog of <i>Cc2d1a, lgd</i>, is embryonically lethal, while in vertebrates, <i>Cc2d1a</i> has a homolog <i>Cc2d1b</i> which appears to be compensating, indicating that <i>Cc2d1a</i> and <i>Cc2d1b</i> have a redundant function in humans and mice. Here, we generate an allelic series of <i>Cc2d1a</i> and <i>Cc2d1b</i> LOF to determine the relative role of these genes during behavioral development. We generated <i>Cc2d1b</i> knockout (KO), <i>Cc2d1a/1b</i> double heterozygous and double KO mice, then performed behavioral studies to analyze learning and memory, social interactions, anxiety, and hyperactivity. We found that <i>Cc2d1a</i> and <i>Cc2d1b</i> have partially overlapping roles. Overall, loss of <i>Cc2d1b</i> is less severe than loss of <i>Cc2d1a</i>, only leading to cognitive deficits, while <i>Cc2d1a/1b</i> double heterozygous animals are similar to <i>Cc2d1a</i>-deficient mice. These results will help us better understand the deficits in individuals with <i>CC2D1A</i> mutations, suggesting that recessive <i>CC2D1B</i> mutations and <i>trans</i>-heterozygous <i>CC2D1A</i> and <i>CC2D1B</i> mutations could also contribute to the genetics of ID."	"Freud-1/Cc2d1a represses the gene transcription of serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptors, which negatively regulate 5-HT tone. To test the role of Freud-1 <i>in vivo</i>, we generated mice with adulthood conditional knock-out of Freud-1 in 5-HT neurons (<i>cF1ko</i>). In <i>cF1ko</i> mice, 5-HT1A autoreceptor protein, binding and hypothermia response were increased, with reduced 5-HT content and neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe. The <i>cF1ko</i> mice displayed increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior that was resistant to chronic antidepressant (fluoxetine) treatment. Using conditional Freud-1/5-HT1A double knock-out (<i>cF1/1A dko</i>) to disrupt both Freud-1 and 5-HT1A genes in 5-HT neurons, no increase in anxiety- or depression-like behavior was seen upon knock-out of Freud-1 on the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-negative background; rather, a reduction in depression-like behavior emerged. These studies implicate transcriptional dysregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors by the repressor Freud-1 in anxiety and depression and provide a clinically relevant genetic model of antidepressant resistance. Targeting specific transcription factors, such as Freud-1, to restore transcriptional balance may augment response to antidepressant treatment.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Altered regulation of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor has been implicated in human anxiety, major depression, suicide, and resistance to antidepressants. This study uniquely identifies a single transcription factor, Freud-1, as crucial for 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression <i>in vivo</i> Disruption of Freud-1 in serotonin neurons in mice links upregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors to anxiety/depression-like behavior and provides a new model of antidepressant resistance. Treatment strategies to reestablish transcriptional regulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors could provide a more robust and sustained antidepressant response."	"The ESCRT-III complex induces outward membrane budding and fission through homotypic polymerization of its core component Shrub/CHMP4B. Shrub activity is regulated by its direct interaction with a protein called Lgd in flies, or CC2D1A or B in humans. Here, we report the structural basis for this interaction and propose a mechanism for regulation of polymer assembly. The isolated third DM14 repeat of Lgd binds Shrub, and an Lgd fragment containing only this DM14 repeat and its C-terminal C2 domain is sufficient for in vivo function. The DM14 domain forms a helical hairpin with a conserved, positively charged tip, that, in the structure of a DM14 domain-Shrub complex, occupies a negatively charged surface of Shrub that is otherwise used for homopolymerization. Lgd mutations at this interface disrupt its function in flies, confirming functional importance. Together, these data argue that Lgd regulates ESCRT activity by controlling access to the Shrub self-assembly surface."	"Five-prime repressor element under dual repression binding protein-1 (Freud-1)/CC2D1A is genetically linked to intellectual disability and implicated in neuronal development. Freud-1 represses the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor gene HTR1A by histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent or HDAC-independent mechanisms in 5-HT1A-negative (e.g., HEK-293) or 5-HT1A-expressing cells (SK-N-SH), respectively. To identify the underlying mechanisms, Freud-1-associated proteins were affinity-purified from HEK-293 nuclear extracts and members of the Brg1/SMARCCA chromatin remodeling and Sin3A-HDAC corepressor complexes were identified. Pull-down assays using recombinant proteins showed that Freud-1 interacts directly with the Brg1 carboxyl-terminal domain; interaction with Brg1 required the carboxyl-terminal of Freud-1. Freud-1 complexes in HEK-293 and SK-N-SH cells differed, with low levels of BAF170/SMARCC2 and BAF57/SMARCE1 in HEK-293 cells and low-undetectable BAF155/SMARCC1, Sin3A, and HDAC1/2 in SK-N-SH cells. Similarly, by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation, Brg1-BAF170/57 and Sin3A-HDAC complexes were observed at the HTR1A promoter in HEK-293 cells, whereas in SK-N-SH cells, Sin3A-HDAC proteins were not detected. Quantifying 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels in cells treated with siRNA to Freud-1, Brg1, or both RNAs addressed the functional role of the Freud-1-Brg1 complex. In HEK-293 cells, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels were increased only when both Freud-1 and Brg1 were depleted, but in SK-N-SH cells, depletion of either protein upregulated 5-HT1A receptor RNA. Thus, recruitment by Freud-1 of Brg1, BAF155, and Sin3A-HDAC complexes appears to strengthen repression of the HTR1A gene to prevent its expression inappropriate cell types, while recruitment of the Brg1-BAF170/57 complex is permissive to 5-HT1A receptor expression. Alterations in Freud-1-Brg1 interactions in mutants associated with intellectual disability could impair gene repression leading to altered neuronal development."	"Patients with lung cancers harboring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions benefit from treatment with ALK inhibitors, but acquired resistance inevitably arises. A better understanding of proximal ALK signaling mechanisms may identify sensitizers to ALK inhibitors that disrupt the balance between prosurvival and proapoptotic effector signals. Using affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry in an ALK fusion lung cancer cell line (H3122), we generated an ALK signaling network and investigated signaling activity using tyrosine phosphoproteomics. We identified a network of 464 proteins composed of subnetworks with differential response to ALK inhibitors. A small hairpin RNA screen targeting 407 proteins in this network revealed 64 and 9 proteins that when knocked down sensitized cells to crizotinib and alectinib, respectively. Among these, knocking down fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) or coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1A (CC2D1A), both scaffolding proteins, sensitized multiple ALK fusion cell lines to the ALK inhibitors crizotinib and alectinib. Collectively, our data set provides a resource that enhances our understanding of signaling and drug resistance networks consequent to ALK fusions and identifies potential targets to improve the efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients."	"Signaling through many transmembrane receptors is terminated by their sorting to the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivescular bodies (MVBs) and subsequent lysosomal degradation. ILV formation requires the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. CC2D1A and CC2D1B interact with the CHMP4 family of proteins, the major subunit of the ESCRT-III complex, however, their roles in receptor degradation and signaling are poorly defined. Here, we report that CC2D1A binds to CHMP4B polymers formed on endosomes to regulate the endosomal sorting pathway. We show that depletion of CC2D1A and B accelerates degradation of EGFR and elicits rapid termination of its downstream signaling through ERK1 and 2. Depletion of CC2D1A and B promotes sorting of EGFR to ILV leading to its rapid lysosomal degradation. In addition, we show that knockdown of CC2D1A and B has similar effects on degradation and downstream signaling of another membrane receptor, TLR4. Thus, these findings suggest that CC2D1A and B may have broad effects on transmembrane receptors by preventing premature ILV sorting and termination of signaling."	"Accurate and rapid estimation of relative binding affinities of ligand-protein complexes is a requirement of computational methods for their effective use in rational ligand design. Of the approaches commonly used, free energy perturbation (FEP) methods are considered one of the most accurate, although they require significant computational resources. Accordingly, it is desirable to have alternative methods of similar accuracy but greater computational efficiency to facilitate ligand design. In the present study relative free energies of binding are estimated for one or two non-hydrogen atom changes in compounds targeting the proteins ACK1 and p38 MAP kinase using three methods. The methods include standard FEP, single-step free energy perturbation (SSFEP) and the site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) ligand grid free energy (LGFE) approach. Results show the SSFEP and SILCS LGFE methods to be competitive with or better than the FEP results for the studied systems, with SILCS LGFE giving the best agreement with experimental results. This is supported by additional comparisons with published FEP data on p38 MAP kinase inhibitors. While both the SSFEP and SILCS LGFE approaches require a significant upfront computational investment, they offer a 1000-fold computational savings over FEP for calculating the relative affinities of ligand modifications once those pre-computations are complete. An illustrative example of the potential application of these methods in the context of screening large numbers of transformations is presented. Thus, the SSFEP and SILCS LGFE approaches represent viable alternatives for actively driving ligand design during drug discovery and development. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."	"Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor is known to play a crucial role in the mechanisms of genetically defined aggression. In its turn, 5-HT1A receptor functional state is under control of multiple factors. Among others, transcriptional factors Freud-1 and Freud-2 are known to be involved in the repression of 5-HT1A receptor gene expression. However, implication of these factors in the regulation of behavior is unclear. Here, we investigated the expression of 5-HT1A receptor and silencers Freud-1 and Freud-2 in the brain of rats selectively bred for 85 generations for either high level of fear-induced aggression or its absence. It was shown that Freud-1 and Freud-2 levels were different in aggressive and nonaggressive animals. Freud-1 protein level was decreased in the hippocampus, whereas Freud-2 protein level was increased in the frontal cortex of highly aggressive rats. There no differences in 5-HT1A receptor gene expression were found in the brains of highly aggressive and nonaggressive rats. However, 5-HT1A receptor protein level was decreased in the midbrain and increased in the hippocampus of highly aggressive rats. These data showed the involvement of Freud-1 and Freud-2 in the regulation of genetically defined fear-induced aggression. However, these silencers do not affect transcription of the 5-HT1A receptor gene in the investigated rats. Our data indicate the implication of posttranscriptional rather than transcriptional regulation of 5-HT1A receptor functional state in the mechanisms of genetically determined aggressive behavior. On the other hand, the implication of other transcriptional regulators for 5-HT1A receptor gene in the mechanisms of genetically defined aggression could be suggested."	"Alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) misfolding and aggregation is common in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, which are known as synucleinopathies. Accumulating evidence suggests that secretion and cell-to-cell trafficking of pathological forms of aSyn may explain the typical patterns of disease progression. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling aSyn aggregation and spreading of pathology are still elusive. In order to obtain unbiased information about the molecular regulators of aSyn oligomerization, we performed a microscopy-based large-scale RNAi screen in living cells. Interestingly, we identified nine Rab GTPase and kinase genes that modulated aSyn aggregation, toxicity and levels. From those, Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 and Slp5 were able to promote the clearance of aSyn inclusions and rescue aSyn induced toxicity. Furthermore, we found that endocytic recycling and secretion of aSyn was enhanced upon Rab11a and Rab13 expression in cells accumulating aSyn inclusions. Overall, our study resulted in the identification of new molecular players involved in the aggregation, toxicity, and secretion of aSyn, opening novel avenues for our understanding of the molecular basis of synucleinopathies. "	"Craniosynostosis, a condition in which the cranial sutures prematurely fuse, can lead to elevated intracranial pressure and craniofacial abnormalities in young children. Currently surgical intervention is the only therapeutic option for patients with this condition. Craniosynostosis has been associated with a variety of different gene mutations and chromosome anomalies. Here we describe three cases of partial deletion of chromosome 19p. Two of the cases present with syndromic craniosynostosis while one has metopic ridging. A review of the genes involved in the rearrangements between the three cases suggests several gene candidates for craniosynostosis. CALR and DAND5, BMP regulators involved in osteoblast differentiation, and MORG1, a mediator of osteoclast dysregulation may play a role in abnormal cranial vault development. Additionally, CACNA1A, a gene that when mutated is associated with epilepsy and CC2D1A, a gene associated with nonsyndromic mental retardation may contribute to additional phenotypic features seen in the patients we describe. In addition, these findings further support the need for genetic testing in cases of syndromic craniosynostosis."	"Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in CC2D1A cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures, identifying a critical role for this gene in cognitive and social development. CC2D1A regulates intracellular signaling processes that are critical for neuronal function, but previous attempts to model the human LOF phenotypes have been prevented by perinatal lethality in Cc2d1a-deficient mice. To overcome this challenge, we generated a floxed Cc2d1a allele for conditional removal of Cc2d1a in the brain using Cre recombinase. While removal of Cc2d1a in neuronal progenitors using Cre expressed from the Nestin promoter still causes death at birth, conditional postnatal removal of Cc2d1a in the forebrain via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha (CamKIIa) promoter-driven Cre generates animals that are viable and fertile with grossly normal anatomy. Analysis of neuronal morphology identified abnormal cortical dendrite organization and a reduction in dendritic spine density. These animals display deficits in neuronal plasticity and in spatial learning and memory that are accompanied by reduced sociability, hyperactivity, anxiety, and excessive grooming. Cc2d1a conditional knockout mice therefore recapitulate features of both cognitive and social impairment caused by human CC2D1A mutation, and represent a model that could provide much needed insights into the developmental mechanisms underlying nonsyndromic neurodevelopmental disorders."	"Classical autism belongs to a group of heterogeneous disorders known as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Autism is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by repetitive stereotypic behaviors or restricted interests, social withdrawal, and communication deficits. Numerous susceptibility genes and chromosomal abnormalities have been reported in association with autism but the etiology of this disorder is unknown in many cases. CC2D1A gene has been linked to mental retardation (MR) in a family with a large deletion before. Intellectual disability (ID) is a common feature of autistic cases. Therefore we aimed to investigate the expressions of CC2D1A and HTR1A genes with the diagnosis of autism in Turkey. Forty-four autistic patients (35 boys, 9 girls) and 27 controls were enrolled and obtained whole blood samples to isolate RNA samples from each participant. CC2D1A and HTR1A gene expressions were assessed by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) in Genome and Stem Cell Center, Erciyes University. Both expressions of CC2D1A and HTR1A genes studied on ASD cases and controls were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001). The expression of HTR1A was undetectable in the ASD samples. Comparison of ID and CC2D1A gene expression was also found statistically significant (p = 0.028). CC2D1A gene expression may be used as a candidate gene for ASD cases with ID. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of these CC2D1A and HTR1A genes in their related pathways in ASD."
"HOXA1"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Dental follicle (DF) can develop into periodontal tissues including periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. Possessing superior pluripotency and osteogenic capacity, dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) have become a promising stem cell source for bone regeneration and periodontal engineering. However, the mechanisms underlying DFSCs-mediated osteogenesis remain elusive. Our previous long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) microarray revealed that lncRNA HOTAIRM1 was significantly higher expressed in human DFSCs (hDFSCs) compared with human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). lncRNA HOTAIRM1, an antisense transcript of the HOXA1/2 intergenic region, can epigenetically regulate proximal and distant HOXA genes through histone and DNA methylation. HOXA2, a target of HOTAIRM1, is crucial for cranial neural crest morphogenesis, branchial arches development, and osteogenesis. However, the roles of both HOTAIRM1 and HOXA2 in odontogenic stem cells remain unknown. Here, we investigated the functions and regulatory mechanisms of these two genes in hDFSCs. Both genes were confirmed highly expressed in hDFSCs compared with hPDLSCs, and they displayed similar expression patterns in the DF and surrounding periodontium during mice tooth morphogenesis. Knockdown of either HOTAIRM1 or HOXA2 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hDFSCs, while overexpressed HOTAIRM1 inhibited hDFSCs proliferation and promoted osteogenesis. Furthermore, HOTAIRM1 inhibited both overall DNMT1 expression and DNMT1 enrichment on HOXA2 promoter, mechanically binding to the CpG islands of the HOXA2 promoter region, leading to hypomethylation and HOXA2 induction. These findings suggested that HOTAIRM1 promoted the osteogenesis of hDFSCs by epigenetically regulating HOXA2 via DNMT1. Taken together, HOTARIM1 and HOXA2 exerted pivotal functions in hDFSCs, and the regulatory mechanism of HOTARIM1 within the HOXA cluster was uncovered."	"Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women worldwide. Approximately 40% of patients with breast cancer acquire endocrine resistance following therapy with tamoxifen. Many explanations for the development of endocrine resistance have been put forward, one of them being the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The lncRNA HOTAIRM1, known to be involved in myelopoiesis as well as transcriptional regulation of the HOXA genes in embryonic stem cells, is also expressed in breast cancer cells. This study explored the molecular mechanisms of HOTAIRM1 involved in acquired tamoxifen resistance. We showed that HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 are concurrently up-regulated in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 (TAMR) cells. Knockdown of HOTAIRM1 down-regulated HOXA1 expression and restored sensitivity to tamoxifen. In addition, the knockdown of HOXA1 showed similar effects, suggesting that the HOTAIRM1/HOXA1 axis regulates tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore, we showed that HOTAIRM1 directly interacts with EZH2 and prevents the PRC2 complex from binding and depositing H3K27me3 on the putative promoter of HOXA1. Together, our findings suggest that HOXA1 and its neighboring lncRNA, HOTAIRM1, might serve as potential therapeutic targets for ER+ breast cancer patients who have acquired tamoxifen resistance."	"Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is a major cause of fatality and morbidity in neonates. However, current treatment approaches to alleviate HIBD are not effective. Various studies have highlighted the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various biological functions in multiple diseases. This study investigated the role of miR-339-5p in HIBD progression. Neonatal HIBD mouse model was induced by ligation of the right common carotid artery. Neuronal cell model exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was also established. The miR-339-5p expression in mouse brain tissues and neuronal cells was quantified, and the effects of miR-339-5p on neuronal cell activity and apoptosis induced by hypoxia-ischemia were explored. The overexpression or knockdown of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in hippocampal neurons was used to determine the effect of lncRNA NEAT1 on the expression of miR-339-5p and homeobox A1 (HOXA1) and apoptosis. Short hairpin RNA targeting lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-339-5p antagomir were used in neonatal HIBD mice to identify their roles in HIBD. Our results revealed that miR-339-5p was downregulated in neonatal HIBD mice and neuronal cells exposed to OGD. Downregulated miR-339-5p promoted neuronal cell viability and suppressed apoptosis during hypoxia-ischemia. Moreover, lncRNA NEAT1 competitively bound to miR-339-5p to increase HOXA1 expression and inhibited neuronal cell apoptosis under hypoxic-ischemic conditions. The key observations of the current study present evidence demonstrating that lncRNA NEAT1 upregulated HOXA1 to alleviate HIBD in mice by binding to miR-339-5p."	"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) colon cancer-associated transcript-1 (CCAT1) has been reported to play important roles in the development and progression of multiple human malignancies. However, the functional role and molecular mechanism of CCAT1 on gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are largely unclear. The aim of this study is to explore the roles of CCAT1 on gefitinib resistance in NSCLC and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was to investigate the expression pattern of CCAT1 in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC patient tissues and cell lines, and then the effects of CCAT1 on gefitinib resistance of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, bioinformatics online program predictions and luciferase reporter assay were used to validate the association of CCAT1 and miR-218 in NSCLC cells. In this study, CCAT1 was observed to be upregulated in gefitinib-resistant patient tissues and cell lines. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that CCAT1 knockdown impaired cell proliferation and promoted the gefitinib-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCAT1 acts as a sponge for miR-218, and verified that HOXA1 is a novel target of miR-218. These results suggest that CCAT1 may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plus NSCLC patients."	"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00473.]."	"Increasing evidence indicates that the dysregulation of miRNAs plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Thus, it is necessary to further investigate the function and mechanism of miRNAs in NPC.miR-100 expression was analyzed using publicly available databases and then tested using quantitative RT-PCR in NPC tissues and cell lines. MTT and colony formation assays and xenograft tumor model were used to test the NPC cell growth and proliferation abilities while modulating miR-100 expression. The target of miR-100 was predicted with TargetScan and validated with luciferase reporter assay, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot.The expression of miR-100 was significantly reduced in NPC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-100 obviously suppressed NPC cell growth and proliferation, whereas silencing miR-100 promoted NPC cell growth and proliferation in vitro. HOXA1 (homeobox A1) was validated as a direct target of miR-100, and restoring HOXA1 expression could reverse the inhibitive effect of miR-100 on NPC cell growth and proliferation. The mRNA and protein expression of HOXA1 was increased in NPC cell lines. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-100 inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo.Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-100 could suppress NPC growth and proliferation through targeting HOXA1, providing a novel target for the miRNA-mediated therapy for patients with NPC in the future."	"Osteoarthritis is disorder of joints featuring inflammation and degeneration of articular cartilage. Recently, miRs have been found to be associated in regulation of chondrocytes and there apoptosis. miR-18a-3p has been found to be associated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, however its role in articular cartilage tissues remains unclear.C57BL/6 strain of mice and human cartilage tissue were used for the study. Histological analysis was done on isolated cartilage samples followed by TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical analysis. The chondrocytes were isolated from mouse and human cartilage tissues, RNA were isolated and subjected for qRT-PCR analysis. The chondrocytes were transfected with miR-18a-3p agomir, antagomir and siHOXA-1. Luciferase assay was done in 293T cells. Flow cytometry analysis was done and western blot analysis for studying expression of proteins.The expression of miR-18a-3p was upregulated in chondrocytes after exposing them to interlukin-1β (IL-1β) in vitro. The transfection of miR-18a-3p antagomir halted the IL-1β mediated apoptosis. The luciferase assay suggested that miR-18a-3p targets the 3'UTR region of HOXA1 gene thus blocking its expression. The treatment of HOXA1 siRNA demonstrated rescuing effect of miR-18a-3p antagomir on the apoptosis of chondrocytes. Treatment of miR-18a-3p antagomir attenuated the surface of cartilage in osteoarthritis mice and the agomir worsened it. TUNEL assay suggested decreased apoptosis and over-expression of HOAX1 in osteoarthritis mice post miR-18a-3p knockdown.The findings confirmed involvement of miR-18a-3p/HOXA1 pathway as a potential mechanism in regulation of Osteoarthritis."	"To investigate the effect of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODN) of Homeobox A1 gene ( <i>HOXA</i>1) on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of esophageal carcinoma cells.The expression of HOXA1 protein in normal esophageal epithelial cells Het-1A and esophageal cancer TE-1, EC9706 and Eca109 cells was detected by Western blot. Screening of highly expressed of HOXA1 protein esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells for follow-up experiments. HOXA1 antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN) chains, sense oligodeoxynucleotides (SODN) chain, and nonsense oligodeoxy nucleotides (N-ODN) chain were designed. The screened esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells with high expression were divided into <i>HOXA</i>1 ASODN group (5, 10, 15 μmol/L <i>HOXA</i>1 ASODN transfected Eca109 cells), control group (conventional culture medium, no cell transfection), SODN group (cells transfected with 15 μmol/L of SODN) and N-ODN group (cells transfected with 15 μmol/L N-ODN). Cell viability, apoptosis rate and invasion and migration ability were detected by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, flow cytometry, transwell chamber respectively; The expression of HOXA1, phosphorylation serine/threonine kinase (p-AKT), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and B-cell lymphoma2 (Bcl-2) associated X protein (Bax) protein was detected by Western blot.Compared with normal esophageal epithelial cells Het-1A, the expression of HOXA1 protein in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells TE-1, EC9706 and Eca109 was significantly higher ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The expression of HOXA1 protein was the highest in Eca109 cells, therefore, Eca109 cells were selected for follow-up experiments. The expression of HOXA1 protein in Eca109 cells transfected with <i>HOXA</i>1 ASODN was significantly decreased ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). After transfection of Eca109 cells with <i>HOXA</i>1 ASODN, the viability of Eca109 cells decreased with the increase of concentration and time, the difference was significant compared with the control, SODN and N-ODN groups ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). 15 μmol/L <i>HOXA</i>1 ASODN significantly inhibited cell viability. After 15 μmol/L <i>HOXA</i>1 ASODN was transfected into Eca109 cells, the invasion and migration abilities of cells were significantly decreased, the apoptosis rate was increased, the expressions of p-AKT, PCNA and MMP-2 were significantly decreased, and the expression of Bax was significantly increased ( <i>P</i>&lt;0.05).Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of <i>HOXA</i>1 gene can inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of esophageal cancer cells, and induce apoptosis. The mechanism is related to the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway."	"Our previous study showed that lncRNA HOTAIR affects the chemoresistance of SCLC by regulating HOXA1 methylation. However, the downstream regulatory mechanism remains unknown. The article aimed to further explore the potential downstream mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that the knockdown of HOTAIR inhibits the NF-κB pathway in SCLC cells. The overexpression of HOXA1, the downstream gene of HOTAIR, also suppresses the NF-κB pathway, but the downregulation of HOXA1 shows the opposite results. Notably, the knockdown of HOXA1 in HOTAIR downregulated cells can rescue the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway mediated by HOTAIR downregulation. Meanwhile, we found that the NF-κB pathway is activated in multidrug-resistant SCLC cells (H69AR, H446AR) compared with the parental cells (H69, H446). The inhibition of the NF-κB pathway with celastrol increases cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these results revealed that the NF-κB pathway may be involved in the chemoresistance of SCLC caused by HOTAIR methylating HOXA1."	"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) microarray screening previously identified that HOXA transcript antisense RNA myeloid-specific 1 (HOTAIRM1) was significantly upregulated in type I endometrial cancer (EC). The present study aimed to determine the potential role of HOTAIRM1 and its sense transcript HOXA1 in the development and progression of type I EC.We detected the expression levels of HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 in type I EC tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting and analyzed associated clinical data. Gain- or loss-of-function experiments were used to investigate the biological function of HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 in type I EC, both in vitro and in vivo.The expression levels of HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 were significantly upregulated in type I EC tissues. Furthermore, the expression of HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 were both significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and lymph node metastasis. The expression of HOTAIRM1 was significantly correlated with that of HOXA1. Knockdown of HOTAIRM1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, while the over-expression of HOTAIRM1 led to the opposite effects. Moreover, we identified that HOTAIRM1 acts as a regulator for the expression of the HOXA1 gene in type I EC cells. As an oncogene, HOXA1 silencing also caused suppressive effects on tumors by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we also confirmed the role of HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 in promoting tumor growth in vivo.Our findings are the first to identify that HOTAIRM1 functions as an oncogene to promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion by regulating HOXA1 in type I EC. Therefore, the HOTAIRM1/HOXA1 axis is a novel potential prognostic biomarker and new potential therapeutic target for type I EC."	"All hematopoietic lineages are derived from a limited pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although the mechanisms underlying HSC self-renewal have been extensively studied, little is known about the role of protein glutamylation and deglutamylation in hematopoiesis. Here, we show that carboxypeptidase CCP3 is most highly expressed in BM cells among CCP members. CCP3 deficiency impairs HSC self-renewal and hematopoiesis. Deubiquitinase BAP1 is a substrate for CCP3 in HSCs. BAP1 is glutamylated at Glu651 by TTLL5 and TTLL7, and BAP1-E651A mutation abrogates BAP1 glutamylation. BAP1 glutamylation accelerates its ubiquitination to trigger its degradation. CCP3 can remove glutamylation of BAP1 to promote its stability, which enhances Hoxa1 expression, leading to HSC self-renewal. Bap1E651A mice produce higher numbers of LT-HSCs and peripheral blood cells. Moreover, TTLL5 and TTLL7 deficiencies sustain BAP1 stability to promote HSC self-renewal and hematopoiesis. Therefore, glutamylation and deglutamylation of BAP1 modulate HSC self-renewal and hematopoiesis."	"Noncoding RNAs regulate transcription of gene expression and play an important role in the pathogenesis of glioblastomas. These tumors are heterogeneous with some glioma stem cells (GSCs) that are highly tumorigenic subpopulations of cells contributing to recurrence and treatment resistance. In this study, GSCs were established by neurosphere cultures of primary glioblastoma cells and validated by the expression of GSC marker CD133. The expression of the long noncoding RNA HOTAIRM1 was detected using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The role of HOTAIRM1 in the proliferation, apoptosis, stemness, and tumorigenicity of GSCs was investigated by soft agar colony formation, flow cytometry, TUNEL analysis, sphere formation, and in vivo xenograft models through silencing of HOTAIRM1. The expression of HOTAIRM1 and the neighboring HOX genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR in different grades of gliomas and nontumor tissues. We found that HOTAIRM1 is significantly elevated in GSCs. The silencing of HOTAIRM1 significantly impairs the proliferation, apoptosis, self-renewal, tumorigenesis of GSCs. In addition, HOTAIRM1 is significantly upregulated in gliomas and associated with tumor grade and patient survival. HOTAIRM1 neighboring genes, HOXA1, HOXA2, and HOXA3, are also significantly upregulated in gliomas and correlate with the expression of HOTAIRM1. Among them, HOXA2 and HOXA3 were identified as being upregulated in GSCs and contributed to the self-renewal of these stem cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HOTAIRM1 plays a critical role in the self-renewal of GSCs. These data also suggest that overexpression of HOTAIRM1 can be a negative prognostic factor for patient survival in malignant glioma and may be a promising potential therapeutic target."	"Galectin-13 (Gal-13) plays numerous roles in regulating the relationship between maternal and fetal tissues. Low expression levels or mutations of the lectin can result in pre-eclampsia. The previous crystal structure and gel filtration data show that Gal-13 dimerizes via formation of two disulfide bonds formed by Cys136 and Cys138. In the present study, we mutated them to serine (C136S, C138S and C136S/C138S), crystalized the variants and solved their crystal structures. All variants crystallized as monomers. In the C136S structure, Cys138 formed a disulfide bond with Cys19, indicating that Cys19 is important for regulation of reversible disulfide bond formation in this lectin. Hemagglutination assays demonstrated that all variants are inactive at inducing erythrocyte agglutination, even though gel filtration profiles indicate that C136S and C138S could still form dimers, suggesting that these dimers do not exhibit the same activity as wild-type (WT) Gal-13. In HeLa cells, the three variants were found to be distributed the same as with WT Gal-13. However, a Gal-13 variant (delT221) truncated at T221 could not be transported into the nucleus, possibly explaining why women having this variant get pre-eclampsia. Considering the normally high concentration of glutathione in cells, WT Gal-13 should exist mostly as a monomer in cytoplasm, consistent with the monomeric variant C136S/C138S, which has a similar ability to interact with HOXA1 as WT Gal-13."	"In a previous study, we found miR-10b to be more abundant in a conditioned culture medium of degenerate embryos compared to that of blastocysts. Here, we show that miR-10b mimics added to the culture medium can be taken up by embryos. This uptake results in an increase in embryonic cell apoptosis and aberrant expression of DNA methyltransferases (<i>DNMTs</i>). Using several algorithms, Homeobox A1 (<i>HOXA1</i>) was identified as one of the potential miR-10b target genes and dual-luciferase assay confirmed <i>HOXA1</i> as a direct target of miR-10b. Microinjection of si-<i>HOXA1</i> into embryos also resulted in an increase in embryonic cell apoptosis and downregulation of <i>DNMTs</i>. Cell progression analysis using Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBKs) showed that miR-10b overexpression and <i>HOXA1</i> knockdown results in suppressed cell cycle progression and decreased cell viability. Overall, this work demonstrates that miR-10b negatively influences embryo quality and might do this through targeting <i>HOXA1</i> and/or influencing DNA methylation."	"The <i>HOXA</i> gene family is associated with various cancer types. However, the role of <i>HOXA</i> genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been comprehensively studied. We compared the transcriptional expression, survival data, and network analysis of <i>HOXA</i>-associated signaling pathways in patients with AML using the ONCOMINE, GEPIA, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, and Metascape databases. We observed that <i>HOXA2-10</i> mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated in AML and that high <i>HOXA1-10</i> expression was associated with poor AML patient prognosis. The <i>HOXA</i> genes were altered in ~18% of the AML samples, either in terms of amplification, deep deletion, or elevated mRNA expression. The following pathways were modulated by <i>HOXA</i> gene upregulation: GO:0048706: embryonic skeletal system development; R-HSA-5617472: activation of <i>HOX</i> genes in anterior hindbrain development during early embryogenesis; GO:0060216: definitive hemopoiesis; hsa05202: transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer; and GO:0045638: negative regulation of myeloid cell differentiation, and they were significantly regulated due to alterations affecting the <i>HOXA</i> genes. This study identified <i>HOXA3-10</i> genes as potential AML therapeutic targets and prognostic markers."	"MicroRNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the development of atherosclerosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of miR-99a-5p and its target gene Homeobox A1 (HOXA1) in atherosclerosis.The biological functions of miR-99a-5p on human aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) were assessed by MTT, wound healing and transwell assays. The target genes of microRNAs were predicted by TargetScan and miRDB. The binding of miR-99a-5p and HOXA1 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. In the in vivo study, high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis model was established in Apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E), oil Red O and Masson trichrome staining were performed for determination of atherosclerotic lesion. The levels of miR-99a-5p and HOXA1 mRNA were detected by real-time PCR. HOXA1 and migration-associated protein levels were detected by western blot or immunohistochemistry analysis.MiR-99a-5p inhibited HOXA1 expression by targeting 3'UTR of HOXA1 mRNA. Enforced HOXA1 significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ASMCs. Furthermore, miR-99a-5p overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ASMCs stimulated by HOXA1, whereas miR-99a-5p inhibition reversed the effects of HOXA1 knockdown on these behaviours of ASMCs. In vivo, the specific overexpression of miR-99a-5p significantly abated atherosclerotic lesions formatted, accompanied with a significant down-regulation of HOXA1 mRNA and protein expression levels.We demonstrate for first time that miR-99a-5p may serve as a potential inhibitor of the atherosclerosis, and miR-99a-5p plays its role partially through targeting HOXA1."	"Ethanol (EtOH) is a teratogen that causes severe birth defects, but the mechanisms by which EtOH affects stem cell differentiation are unclear. Our goal here is to examine the effects of EtOH and its metabolites, acetaldehyde (AcH) and acetate, on embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation.We designed ESC lines in which aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2, NCBI#11669) and acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2, NCBI#60525) were knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We selected these genes because of their key roles in EtOH oxidation in order to dissect the effects of EtOH metabolism on differentiation.By using kinetic assays, we confirmed that AcH is primarily oxidized by ALDH2 rather than ALDH1A2. We found increases in mRNAs of differentiation-associated genes (Hoxa1, Cyp26a1, and RARβ2) upon EtOH treatment of WT and Acss2<sup>-/-</sup> ESCs, but not Aldh2<sup>-/-</sup> ESCs. The absence of ALDH2 reduced mRNAs of some pluripotency factors (Nanog, Sox2, and Klf4). Treatment of WT ESCs with AcH or 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), another substrate of ALDH2, increased differentiation-associated transcripts compared to levels in untreated cells. mRNAs of genes involved in retinoic acid (RA) synthesis (Stra6 and Rdh10) were also increased by EtOH, AcH, and 4-HNE treatment. Retinoic acid receptor-γ (RARγ) is required for both EtOH- and AcH-mediated increases in Hoxa1 and Stra6, demonstrating the critical role of RA:RARγ signaling in AcH-induced ESC differentiation.ACSS2 knockouts showed no changes in differentiation phenotype, while pluripotency-related transcripts were decreased in ALDH2 knockout ESCs. We demonstrate that AcH increases differentiation-associated mRNAs in ESCs via RARγ."	"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the third frequently tumor worldwide. MicroRNA-99a (miR-99a), acting as a tumor suppressor, has been reported to be downregulated in multiple tumors. We aimed at exploring the significant roles of miR-99a in ovarian cancer.Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were applied to calculate the mRNA and protein levels of miR-99a and its target genes. Kaplan-Meier method was conducted to evaluate the overall survival of ovarian cancer patients. CCK8 and transwell assays were performed to measure the proliferative and invasive abilities.miR-99a, acting as a prognosis predictor, was downregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. miR-99a mediated the expression of homeobox A1 (HOXA1) through directly targeting to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of its mRNA in ovarian cancer cell lines. miR-99a inhibited the proliferation of ovarian cancer by AKT/mTOR pathway in vitro and in vivo, and it suppressed the invasion-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through direct targeting to the 3'-UTR of HOXA1 mRNA.miR-99a suppressed the proliferation through AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and the invasion-mediated EMT in ovarian cancer. The newly identified miR-99a/HOXA1/AKT/mTOR axis provides novel insight into the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer."	"Noncoding somatic mutations have been demonstrated to play important role in tumourigenesis. Here we show that there exists an acute myeloid leukaemia associated noncoding somatic mutation at 3' terminal of conserved <i>HOXA</i> cluster. The mutation was identified in the bone marrow blasts but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells or buccal cells of two M3 (acute promyelocytic leukaemia, APL) type patients from 45 acute myeloid leukaemia patients. The mutation also existed in a pair of twins one of them developed acute myeloid leukaemia M4 (acute myelomonocytic leukaemia) type. The mutation resides in about 2-kb downstream of <i>HOXA1</i> gene where a functional retinoic acid response element is located and also bound by histone demethylase KDM3B. Reporter assay showed that the mutation results in the upregulation of transcriptional activity and unresponsiveness to retinoic acid receptor. To sum up, we identified a new acute myeloid leukaemia associated noncoding somatic mutation."	"Liver cancer is a malignant tumor that threatens human health worldwide. It has poor prognosis rates and ineffective therapeutic options. Recently, various miRNAs have been proven to exert promoting or inhibiting functions in different malignancies. However, the definitive mechanisms of miR-99a in liver cancer remain unclear. In the current study, we explored the relationships between the expression of miR-99a and <i>HOXA1</i> in liver cancer tissues and cells to explore their combined effects on the occurrence and metastasis of liver cancer. The expression of miR-99a and <i>HOXA1</i> in liver cancer tissue samples and cells was measured by RT-qPCR. Following transfection, transwell assays were conducted to assess the invasion and migration capacities of liver cancer cells. Subsequently, western blots and luciferase reporter assays were performed in liver cancer cells to identify the target of miR-99a. The data indicated that miRNA-99a expression was significantly reduced in both liver cancer tissue samples and cells compared with normal tissues and normal liver cells respectively. By contrast, the <i>HOXA1</i> expression levels in liver cancer tissues and cells were significantly increased in contrast to the control group. The findings also revealed that the miR-99a expression was negatively correlated with <i>HOXA1</i> expression in liver cancer tissue samples and miR-99a could suppress cell invasion and migration by targeting <i>HOXA1</i> in liver cancer."
"IQSEC2"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"The pentameric glycine receptor (GlyR), comprising the α1 and β subunits, is a major inhibitory ionotropic receptor in brainstem and spinal cord. GlyRs interact with gephyrin (GPHN), a scaffold protein that anchors the GlyR in the plasma membrane and enables it to form clusters in glycinergic postsynapses. Using an interaction proteomics approach, evidence of the ArfGEFs IQ motif and Sec7 domain 3 (IQSEC3) and IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 (IQSEC2) as two novel synaptic proteins interacting with GlyR complexes is provided. When the affinity-isolated GlyR complexes are fractionated by blue native gel electrophoresis and characterized by mass spectrometry, GlyR α1β-GPHN appears as the most abundant complex with a molecular weight of ≈1 MDa, and GlyR α1β-GPHN-IQSEC3 as a minor protein complex of ≈1.2 MDa. A third GlyR α1β-GPHN-IQSEC2 complex exists at the lowest amount with a mass similar to the IQSEC3 containing complex. Using yeast two-hybrid it is demonstrated that IQSEC3 interacts with the GlyR complex by binding to the GPHN G domain at the N-terminal of the IQSEC3 IQ-like domain. The data provide direct evidence of the interaction of IQSEC3 with GlyR-GPHN complexes, underscoring a potential role of these ArfGEFs in the function of glycinergic synapses."	"Mutations in the X-linked gene IQSEC2 are associated with multiple cases of epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, the mechanistic understanding and successful treatment of which remain a significant challenge in IQSEC2 and related neurodevelopmental genetic diseases. To investigate disease etiology, we studied behaviors and synaptic function in IQSEC2 deficient mice. Hemizygous Iqsec2 null males exhibit growth deficits, hyperambulation and hyperanxiety phenotypes. Adult hemizygotes experience lethal spontaneous seizures, but paradoxically have a significantly increased threshold to electrically induced limbic seizures and relative resistance to chemically induced seizures. Although there are no gross defects in brain morphology, hemizygotes exhibit stark hippocampal reactive astrogliosis. Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal neurons reveal increased excitatory drive specifically onto interneurons, and significant alterations in intrinsic electrical properties specific to the interneuron population. As they age, hemizygotes also develop an increased abundance of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus, neurons in which IQSEC2 is expressed in addition to the excitatory neurons. These findings point to a novel role of IQSEC2 in hippocampal interneuron synaptic function and development with implications for a class of intractable neurodevelopmental diseases."	"X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is known to contribute up to 10% of intellectual disability (ID) in males and could explain the increased ratio of affected males observed in patients with ID. Over the past decade, next-generation sequencing has clearly stimulated the gene discovery process and has become part of the diagnostic procedure. We have performed targeted next-generation sequencing of 82 XLID genes on 61 non-related male patients with suggestive non-syndromic XLID. These patients were initially referred to the molecular genetics laboratory to exclude Fragile X Syndrome. The cohort includes 47 male patients with suggestive X-linked family history of ID meaning that they had half-brothers or maternal cousins or uncles affected; and 14 male patients with ID and affected brothers whose mothers show skewed X-inactivation. Sequencing data analysis identified 17 candidate variants in 16 patients. Seven families could be re-contacted and variant segregation analysis of the respective eight candidate variants was performed: <i>HUWE1</i>, <i>IQSEC2</i>, <i>MAOA</i>, <i>MED12</i>, <i>PHF8</i>, <i>SLC6A8</i>, <i>SLC9A6</i><i>,</i> and <i>SYN1</i>. Our results show the utility of targeted next-generation sequencing in unravelling the genetic origin of XLID, especially in retrospective cases. Variant segregation and additional studies like RNA sequencing and biochemical assays also helped in re-evaluating and further classifying the genetic variants found."	"<b>                        <i>Aim:</i>                    </b> Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe type of childhood-onset epilepsy with multiple types of seizures, specific discharges on electroencephalography, and intellectual disability. However, LGS-related genes are largely unknown. To identify causative genes related to LGS, we collected and analyzed data from a three-generation Korean family in which one member had LGS and two had intellectual disability. <b>                        <i>Methods:</i>                    </b> Genomic DNAs were extracted from blood samples of all participants and used in whole-exome sequencing (WES). Genetic variants were detected by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Variant pathogenicity was evaluated by prediction programs and the American College of Medical Genetics criteria. The LGS patient had generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges, multiple types of seizures, and developmental delay. <b>                        <i>Results:</i>                    </b> Analyses of the WES data from the family revealed a novel variant (c.1048G&gt;A, p.Ala350Thr) in the IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 (<i>IQSEC2</i>). This variant is within a highly evolutionarily conserved IQ-like motif, indicating a decrease in the calmodulin-binding capacity or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid transmission. The hemizygous variant in the male with LGS was a maternally inherited X-linked variant from the heterozygous maternal grandmother and mother, both of whom had intellectual disability. <b>                        <i>Conclusion:</i>                    </b> These findings indicate that the variant of <i>IQSEC2</i> triggered both LGS and intellectual disability dependent on sex in this family. We report a novel X-linked inherited <i>IQSEC2</i> variant for LGS and intellectual disability, which enhances the spectrum of variants in the IQ-like motif of <i>IQSEC2</i>."	"This study aimed to investigate the new genetic etiologies of Rett syndrome (RTT) or Rett-like phenotypes.Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 44 Chinese patients with RTT or Rett-like phenotypes, in whom genetic analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 was negative.The detection rate was 31.8% (14/44). A de novo pathogenic variant (c.275_276ins AA, p. Cys92*) of KIF1A was identified in a girl with all core features of typical RTT. A patient with atypical RTT was detected having de novo GRIN1 pathogenic variant (c.2337C &gt; A, p. Val793Phe). Additionally, compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of PPT1 gene were detected in a girl, who initially displayed typical RTT features, but progressed into neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) afterwards. Pathogenic variants in KCNQ2, MEF2C, WDR45, TCF4, IQSEC2, and SDHA were also found in our cohort.It is the first time that pathogenic variants of GRIN1 and KIF1A were linked to RTT and Rett-like profiles. Our findings expanded the genetic heterogeneity of Chinese RTT or Rett-like patients, and also suggest that some patients with genetic metabolic disease such as NCL, might displayed Rett features initially, and clinical follow-up is essential for the diagnosis."	"Intellectual disability refers to significantly subaverage intellectual function (intelligence quotient &lt; 70) with impairment of adaptive function. The IQSEC2 gene is one of the pathogenic genes located on chromosome Xp11.22. IQSEC2 is an X-linked gene correlated with intellectual disability and epilepsy. In this study, we reported a 2-year-old male patient presented with reacting sluggishly with people and surroungdings. Active electroencephalogram showed the background of epileptic activity. Brain MRI revealed patchy hyperintensity of bilateral parietal lobe white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image and widened ventricle, cistern and sulci on T2-weighted image. Delayed myelination was considered. The diagnosis of intellectual disability and epilepsy was made. Whole exome-sequencing was conducted and identified a novel frameshift mutation in exon 15 of IQSEC2 (NM_001111125.2: c.4164dupC: p.Ile1389 Hisfs*218). The variant resulted in the deletion of termination codon, and the protein was extended to termination after stretch of 218 amino acids.This study expands the mutation spectrum of IQSEC2. It supports the published data suggesting that IQSEC2 plays a significant part in patients with intellectual disability and epilepsy. IQSEC2 should be detected in patients with intellectual disability and epilepsy."	"Clinical presentations of mutations in the <i>IQSEC2</i> gene on the X-chromosome initially implicated to cause non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID) in males have expanded to include early onset seizures in males as well as in females. The molecular pathogenesis is not well understood, nor the mechanisms driving disease expression in heterozygous females. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-edited <i>Iqsec2</i> KO mouse model, we confirm the loss of <i>Iqsec2</i> mRNA expression and lack of Iqsec2 protein within the brain of both founder and progeny mice. Both male (52%) and female (46%) <i>Iqsec2</i> KO mice present with frequent and recurrent seizures. Focusing on <i>Iqsec2</i> KO heterozygous female mice, we demonstrate increased hyperactivity, altered anxiety and fear responses, decreased social interactions, delayed learning capacity and decreased memory retention/novel recognition, recapitulating psychiatric issues, autistic-like features, and cognitive deficits present in female patients with loss-of-function <i>IQSEC2</i> variants. Despite Iqsec2 normally acting to activate Arf6 substrate, we demonstrate that mice modelling the loss of Iqsec2 function present with increased levels of activated Arf6. We contend that loss of Iqsec2 function leads to altered regulation of activated Arf6-mediated responses to synaptic signalling and immature synaptic networks. We highlight the importance of IQSEC2 function for females by reporting a novel nonsense variant c.566C &gt; A, p.(S189*) in an elderly female patient with profound intellectual disability, generalised seizures, and behavioural disturbances. Our human and mouse data reaffirm <i>IQSEC2</i> as another disease gene with an unexpected X-chromosome heterozygous female phenotype. Our Iqsec2 mouse model recapitulates the phenotypes observed in human patients despite the differences in the IQSEC2/Iqsec2 gene X-chromosome inactivation between the species."	"Pathogenic variants in the IQSEC2 gene including nonsense, frameshift, splice-alterations, deletions, and missense changes have been identified in individuals with X-linked mental retardation. Although highly variable, clinical features may include hypotonia, moderate to severe delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, speech deficits, refractory seizures, autistic features, and stereotypical movements. Females with de novo variants have been described with classical features. In contrast, the phenotype in carrier females identified through an affected male may range from asymptomatic to mild intellectual disability. We present male (N = 2) and female (N = 3) probands ascertained via diagnostic exome sequencing with distinct variant types in the IQSEC2 gene encompassing a spectrum of phenotypic severity with patient sex, variant type and inheritance hypothesized to drive disease penetrance and expressivity. All of these patients demonstrated epilepsy, global developmental delays, intellectual disability, and constipation. Our data support that de novo, truncating variants correlate with severe disease in both female and male patients harboring an IQSEC2 alteration. Missense variants in male and female patients may account for a milder disease overall, with more severe symptoms in males than females. We also present the first confirmed case of parental mosaicism, which has implications regarding counseling for recurrence risk. These data further delineate a genotype-phenotype correlation of IQSEC2 variation."	"Nonsyndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is one of the most common human congenital defects. Rs2262251 (G&gt;C) in long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-462G12.2 is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs8049367, which was identified in our previous genome-wide association study on NSCL/P, and is a potential causative single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for NSCL/P. To test these hypotheses, rs2262251 was evaluated in another cohort of 1,314 cases and 1,259 controls. Rs2262251 was associated with NSCL/P risk (p = .003). However, no association was detected for cleft palate only. SNP rs2262251 affected the structure and expression of lncRNA RP11-462G12.2 in HEK293 and HEPM cells and in lip tissues from patients with NSCL/P. Overexpression of the rs2262251 G allele contributed to reducing the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase, inhibiting cell apoptosis, and promoting cell proliferation in vitro. The rs2262251 C allele regulated the expression of miR-744-5p and its target gene IQSEC2, both of which were expressed in human lip tissues, and showed reverse correlation during mouse lip development. Taken together, these findings suggest that rs2262251 is associated with the risk of NSCL/P and participates in a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis in which miR-744-5p and IQSEC2 combine to control NSCL/P development."	"Mutations in <i>IQSEC2</i> cause intellectual disability (ID), which is often accompanied by seizures and autism. A number of studies have shown that IQSEC2 is an abundant protein in excitatory synapses and plays an important role in neuronal development as well as synaptic plasticity. Here, we review neuronal IQSEC2 signaling with emphasis on those aspects likely to be involved in autism. IQSEC2 is normally bound to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors via post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). Activation of NMDA receptors results in calcium ion influx and binding to calmodulin present on the IQSEC2 IQ domain. Calcium/calmodulin induces a conformational change in IQSEC2 leading to activation of the SEC7 catalytic domain. GTP is exchanged for GDP on ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). Activated ARF6 promotes downregulation of surface α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors through a c-jun N terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated pathway. NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, and PSD-95 are all known to be adversely affected in autism. An <i>IQSEC2</i> transgenic mouse carrying a constitutively active mutation (A350V) shows autistic features and reduced levels of surface AMPA receptor subunit GluA2. Sec7 activity and AMPA receptor recycling are presented as two targets, which may respond to drug treatment in IQSEC2-associated ID and autism."	"Although genetic testing is important for bringing precision medicine to children with epilepsy, it is unclear what genetic testing strategy is best in maximizing diagnostic yield.To evaluate the diagnostic yield of an exome-based gene panel for childhood epilepsy and discuss the value of follow-up testing.A case series study was conducted on data from clinical genetic testing at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was conducted from September 26, 2016, to January 8, 2018. Initial testing targeted 100 curated epilepsy genes for sequence and copy number analysis in 151 children with idiopathic epilepsy referred consecutively by neurologists. Additional genetic testing options were offered afterward.Clinical genetic testing.Molecular diagnostic findings.Of 151 patients (84 boys [55.6%]; median age, 4.2 years [interquartile range, 1.4-8.7 years]), 16 children (10.6%; 95% CI, 6%-16%) received a diagnosis after initial panel analysis. Parental testing for 15 probands with inconclusive results revealed de novo variants in 7 individuals (46.7%), resulting in an overall diagnostic yield of 15.3% (23 of 151; 95% CI, 9%-21%). Twelve probands with nondiagnostic panel findings were reflexed to exome sequencing, and 4 were diagnostic (33.3%; 95% CI, 6%-61%), raising the overall diagnostic yield to 17.9% (27 of 151; 95% CI, 12%-24%). The yield was highest (17 of 44 [38.6%; 95% CI, 24%-53%]) among probands with epilepsy onset in infancy (age, 1-12 months). Panel diagnostic findings involved 16 genes: SCN1A (n = 4), PRRT2 (n = 3), STXBP1 (n = 2), IQSEC2 (n = 2), ATP1A2, ATP1A3, CACNA1A, GABRA1, KCNQ2, KCNT1, SCN2A, SCN8A, DEPDC5, TPP1, PCDH19, and UBE3A (all n = 1). Exome sequencing analysis identified 4 genes: SMC1A, SETBP1, NR2F1, and TRIT1. For the remaining 124 patients, analysis of 13 additional genes implicated in epilepsy since the panel was launched in 2016 revealed promising findings in 6 patients.Exome-based targeted panels appear to enable rapid analysis of a preselected set of genes while retaining flexibility in gene content. Successive genetic workup should include parental testing of select probands with inconclusive results and reflex to whole-exome trio analysis for the remaining nondiagnostic cases. Periodic reanalysis is needed to capture information in newly identified disease genes."	"We have recently described an A350V mutation in IQSEC2 associated with intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy. We sought to understand the molecular pathophysiology of this mutation with the goal of developing targets for drug intervention. We demonstrate here that the A350V mutation results in interference with the binding of apocalmodulin to the IQ domain of IQSEC2. We further demonstrate that this mutation results in constitutive activation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of IQSEC2 resulting in increased production of the active form of Arf6. In a CRISPR generated mouse model of the A350V IQSEC2 mutation, we demonstrate that the surface expression of GluA2 AMPA receptors in mouse hippocampal tissue was significantly reduced in A350V IQSEC2 mutant mice compared to wild type IQSEC2 mice and that there is a significant reduction in basal synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of A350V IQSEC2 mice compared to wild type IQSEC2 mice. Finally, the A350V IQSEC2 mice demonstrated increased activity, abnormal social behavior and learning as compared to wild type IQSEC2 mice. These findings suggest a model of how the A350V mutation in IQSEC2 may mediate disease with implications for targets for drug therapy. These studies provide a paradigm for a personalized approach to precision therapy for a disease that heretofore has no therapy."	"Whole-exome sequencing has established IQSEC2 as a neurodevelopmental disability gene. The IQSEC2 variant phenotype includes developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, hypotonia, autism, developmental regression, microcephaly and stereotypies but is yet to be fully described. Presented here are 14 new patients with IQSEC2 variants. In addition to the established features, we observed: gait ataxia in 7 of 9 (77.8%), drooling in 9 of 14 (64.2%), early feeding difficulties in 7 of 14 (50%), structural brain abnormalities in 6 of 13 (46.2%), brachycephaly in 5 of 14 (35.7%), and scoliosis and paroxysms of laughter each in 4 of 14 (28.6%). We suggest that these are features of the IQSEC2-related disorder. Gastrostomy requirement, plagiocephaly, strabismus and cortical blindness, each seen in 2 of 14 (14.3%), may also be associated. Shared facial features were noted in 8 of 14 patients, and shared hair patterning was identified in 5 of 14 patients. This study further delineates the IQSEC2 phenotypic spectrum and supports the notion of an emerging IQSEC2 syndrome. We draw parallels between the IQSEC2-related disorder and the Angelman-/Rett-/Pitt-Hopkins syndrome group of conditions and recommend the addition of IQSEC2 to epilepsy and developmental delay gene panels. We observed discordant phenotypes in monozygotic twins and apparent gonadal mosaicism, which has implications for recurrence risk counselling in the IQSEC2-related disorder."	"The IQSEC2- related disorders represent a spectrum of X-chromosome phenotypes with intellectual disability (ID) as the cardinal feature. Here, we review the increasing number of reported families and isolated cases have been reported with a variety of different pathogenic variants. The spectrum of clinical features is expanding with early-onset seizures as a frequent comorbidity in both affected male and female patients. There is a growing number of female patients with de novo loss-of-function variants in IQSEC2 have a more severe phenotype than the heterozygous state would predict, particularly if IQSEC2 is thought to escape X-inactivation. Interestingly, these findings highlight that the classical understanding of X-linked inheritance does not readily explain the emergence of these affected females, warranting further investigations into the underlying mechanisms."

"Previous studies have suggested that heterozygous variants p.Q1236H and p.E1143G in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) increase the risk for liver injury for patients on valproate (VPA) therapy. We assessed the prevalence of these common variants and seven other pathogenic mutations in POLG1 and determined the occurrence of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity (VHT) or pancreatic toxicity in a cohort of patients with epilepsy.Patients with epilepsy (N = 367) were retrospectively identified from medical record files and screened for mutations in POLG1. Patients who had received VPA monotherapy and carried either of the two variants, p.Q1236H or p.E1143G, without other pathogenic mutations in POLG1 (n = 33, variant group) and patients without these variants (n = 28, nonvariant group) were included in the study. Clinical data on epilepsy, characteristics of VPA treatment, risk factors for VHT, laboratory data on liver and pancreas functions, and adverse effects were collected.A total of 122 patients had either the POLG1 p.Q1236H (n = 99) or p.E1143G (n = 24) variant in the heterozygous or homozygous state. Transient liver dysfunction was identified in three (n = 33, 9.1%) variant group patients and in one (n = 28, 3.6%) nonvariant group patient (P = 0.62). Mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes were encountered in both groups. Furthermore, two patients on VPA polytherapy developed acute pancreatitis, and two pediatric patients with heterozygous p.Q1236H variants and mutations in IQSEC2 and GLDC, respectively, had elevated levels of VPA metabolites in urine, elevated plasma glycine, and/or increased acylglycine excretion.POLG1 p.Q1236H and p.E1143G variants could not be identified as statistically significant risk factors for VHT or pancreatic toxicity. We suggest that VPA treatment could be suitable for patients who harbor these common variants in the absence of other pathogenic mutations in POLG1."	"Variants in IQSEC2, escaping X inactivation, cause X-linked intellectual disability with frequent epilepsy in males and females. We aimed to investigate sex-specific differences.We collected the data of 37 unpublished patients (18 males and 19 females) with IQSEC2 pathogenic variants and 5 individuals with variants of unknown significance and reviewed published variants. We compared variant types and phenotypes in males and females and performed an analysis of IQSEC2 isoforms.IQSEC2 pathogenic variants mainly led to premature truncation and were scattered throughout the longest brain-specific isoform, encoding the synaptic IQSEC2/BRAG1 protein. Variants occurred de novo in females but were either de novo (2/3) or inherited (1/3) in males, with missense variants being predominantly inherited. Developmental delay and intellectual disability were overall more severe in males than in females. Likewise, seizures were more frequently observed and intractable, and started earlier in males than in females. No correlation was observed between the age at seizure onset and severity of intellectual disability or resistance to antiepileptic treatments.This study provides a comprehensive overview of IQSEC2-related encephalopathy in males and females, and suggests that an accurate dosage of IQSEC2 at the synapse is crucial during normal brain development."	"Pediatric refractory epilepsy is a broad phenotypic spectrum with great genetic heterogeneity. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) combined with Sanger sequencing could help to understand the genetic diversity and underlying disease mechanisms in pediatric epilepsy. Here, we report sequencing results from a cohort of 172 refractory epilepsy patients aged 0-14 years. The pathogenicity of identified variants was evaluated in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. We identified 43 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 40 patients (23.3%). Among these variants, 74.4% mutations (32/43) were de novo and 60.5% mutations (26/43) were novel. Patients with onset age of seizures ≤12 months had higher yields of deleterious variants compared to those with onset age of seizures &gt; 12 months (P = 0.006). Variants in ion channel genes accounted for the greatest functional gene category (55.8%), with SCN1A coming first (16/43). 81.25% (13/16) of SCN1A mutations were de novo and 68.8% (11/16) were novel in Dravet syndrome. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in the KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN2A genes in Ohtahara syndrome. Novel deleterious variants were also found in West syndrome, Doose syndrome and glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome patients. One de novo MECP2 mutation were found in a Rett syndrome patient. TSC1/TSC2 variants were found in 60% patients with tuberous sclerosis complex patients. Other novel mutations detected in unclassified epilepsy patients involve the SCN8A, CACNA1A, GABRB3, GABRA1, IQSEC2, TSC1, VRK2, ATP1A2, PCDH19, SLC9A6 and CHD2 genes. Our study provides novel insights into the genetic origins of pediatric epilepsy and represents a starting-point for further investigations into the molecular pathophysiology of pediatric epilepsy that could eventually lead to better treatments."	"Epilepsy is a common and genetically heterogeneous disorder among children. Advances in next-generation sequencing have revealed that numerous epilepsy genes, helped us improve the understanding of mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis, and guided the development of treatments. We identified 39 candidate variants in 21 genes, including 37 that were pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics scoring system and two variants of uncertain significance that were considered causative after they were associated with clinical characteristics. Thirty were de novo variants (76.9%), and 20 variants had not previously been reported (51.3%). We obtained a diagnosis in 39 of the 141 probands (27.7%). The most frequently mutated gene was SCN1A; KCNQ2, KCNT1, PCDH19, STXBP1, SCN2A, TSC2, and PRRT2 were mutated in more than one individual; ANKRD11, CDKL5, DCX, DEPDC5, GABRB3, GRIN2A, IQSEC2, KCNA2, KCNB1, KCNJ6, TSC1, SCN9A, and SCN1B were mutated in a single individual. In addition, we detected a nonsense variant in a candidate gene KCND1 and considered it as a new candidate epilepsy gene, which needed further functional study. Consequently, large number of unreported variants were detected, diverse phenotypes were associated with known epilepsy genes. Changes in clinical management beyond genetic counseling were suggested."	"Precise trafficking events, such as those that underlie synaptic transmission and plasticity, require complex regulation. G-protein signaling plays an essential role in the regulation of membrane and protein trafficking. However, it is not well understood how small GTPases and their regulatory proteins coordinate such specific events. Our recent publication focused on a highly abundant synaptic GEF, BRAG1, whose physiologic relevance was unknown. We find that BRAG1s GEF activity is required for activity-dependent trafficking of AMPARs. Moreover, BRAG1 bidirectionally regulates synaptic transmission in a manner independent of this activity. In addition to the GEF domain, BRAG1 contains several functional domains whose roles are not yet understood but may mediate protein-protein interactions and regulatory effects necessary for its role in regulation of AMPAR trafficking. In this commentary, we explore the potential for BRAG1 to provide specificity of small GTPase signaling, coordinating activity-dependent activation of small GTPase activity with signaling and scaffolding molecules involved in trafficking through its GEF activity and other functional domains."
"NLGN4X"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is more prevalent in males; however, the etiology for this sex bias is not well understood. Many mutations on X-linked cell adhesion molecule NLGN4X result in ASD or intellectual disability. NLGN4X is part of an X-Y pair, with NLGN4Y sharing ∼97% sequence homology. Using biochemistry, electrophysiology, and imaging, we show that NLGN4Y displays severe deficits in maturation, surface expression, and synaptogenesis regulated by one amino acid difference with NLGN4X. Furthermore, we identify a cluster of ASD-associated mutations surrounding the critical amino acid in NLGN4X, and these mutations phenocopy NLGN4Y. We show that NLGN4Y cannot compensate for the functional deficits observed in ASD-associated NLGN4X mutations. Altogether, our data reveal a potential pathogenic mechanism for male bias in NLGN4X-associated ASD."	"Mature dendritic cells (DCs) represent cellular adjuvants for optimal antigen presentation in cancer vaccines. Recently, a combination of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) with Toll-like receptor agonists (TLR-P) was proposed as a new standard to generate superior cytokine-producing DCs with high migratory capacity. Here, we compare TLR-P DCs with conventional DCs matured only with the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1ß (CDCs), focussing on the interaction of resulting DCs with CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. TLR-P matured DCs showed elevated expression of activation markers such as CD80 and CD83 compared to CDCs, together with a significantly higher migration capacity. Secretion of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 was highest after 16 h in TLR-P DCs, and only TLR-P DCs secreted active IL-12p70. TLR-P DCs as well as CDCs successfully primed multifunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from naïve precursors specific for the peptide antigens Melan-A, NLGN4X, and PTP with comparable priming efficacy and T-cell receptor avidity. CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells primed by TLR-P DCs showed significantly elevated expression of the integrin VLA-4 and a trend for higher T-cell numbers after expansion. In contrast, TLR-P DCs displayed a substantially reduced capability to cross-present CMVpp65 protein antigen to pp65-specific T cells, an effect that was dose-dependent on PGE<sub>2</sub> during DC maturation and reproducible with several responder T-cell lines. In conclusion, TLR-P matured DCs might be optimal presenters of antigens not requiring processing such as short peptides. However, PGE<sub>2</sub> seems less favorable for maturation of DCs intended to process and cross-present more complex vaccine antigens such as lysates, proteins or long peptides."	"Variants in genes encoding synaptic adhesion proteins of the neuroligin family, most notably neuroligin-4, are a significant cause of autism spectrum disorders in humans. Although human neuroligin-4 is encoded by two genes, NLGN4X and NLGN4Y, that are localized on the X-specific and male-specific regions of the two sex chromosomes, the chromosomal localization and full genomic sequence of the mouse Nlgn4 gene remain elusive. Here, we analyzed the neuroligin-4 genes of numerous rodent species by direct sequencing and bioinformatics, generated complete drafts of multiple rodent neuroligin-4 genes, and examined their evolution. Surprisingly, we find that the murine Nlgn4 gene is localized to the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the sex chromosomes, different from its human orthologs. We show that the sequence differences between various neuroligin-4 proteins are restricted to hotspots in which rodent neuroligin-4 proteins contain short repetitive sequence insertions compared with neuroligin-4 proteins from other species, whereas all other protein sequences are highly conserved. Evolutionarily, these sequence insertions initiate in the clade eumuroidea of the infraorder myomorpha and are additionally associated with dramatic changes in noncoding sequences and gene size. Importantly, these changes are not exclusively restricted to neuroligin-4 genes but reflect major evolutionary changes that substantially altered or even deleted genes from the PARs of both sex chromosomes. Our results show that despite the fact that the PAR in rodents and the neuroligin-4 genes within the rodent PAR underwent massive evolutionary changes, neuroligin-4 proteins maintained a highly conserved core structure, consistent with a substantial evolutionary pressure preserving its physiological function."	"Since the early days of PCR techniques, sex identification, &quot;sex-typing,&quot; of genomic DNA samples has been a fundamental part of human forensic analysis but also in animal genetics aiming at strategic livestock breeding. Most analyses are employing the AMELX/AMELY gene loci on the X and Y chromosomes present in most mammals. We hypothesize that sex-typing in humans is also possible based on the genes NLGN4X and NLGN4Y, which represent X and Y chromosome-specific copies of a common ancestral neuroligin-4 orthologue.Genomic DNA was isolated from human blood and buccal cell samples (total n = 111) and submitted to two different strategies: (a) a traditional two-primer PCR approach detecting an insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism immediately upstream of the translational start on exon 1 and (b) detection of a single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP, on the translational stop carrying exon 7. The SNP detection was based on a quantitative PCR approach (rhAMP genotyping) employing DNA/RNA hybrid oligonucleotides that were blocked and which could only be activated upon perfect annealing to the target DNA sequence.All indel PCR-tested human DNA samples showed two bands for males representing X- and Y-specific copies of NLGN4 and a single band for female samples, i.e., homozygosity of NLGN4X and absence of NLGN4Y, in accordance with the self-reported sex of the donors. These results were in perfect agreement with the results of the rhAMP-based SNP-detection method: all males were consequently positive for both alleles, representing either SNP variant, and females were interpreted as homozygous regarding the SNP variant found in NLGN4X. Both methods have shown reliable and consistent results that enabled us to infer the sex of donor DNA samples across different ethnicities.These results indicate that the detection of human NLGN4X/Y is a suitable alternative to previously reported methods employing gene loci such as AMELX/Y. Furthermore, this is the first report applying successfully the rhAMP-genotyping strategy as a means for SNP-based sex-typing, which consequently will be applicable to other gene loci or different species as well."	"The autism-associated synaptic-adhesion gene Neuroligin-4 (NLGN4) is poorly conserved evolutionarily, limiting conclusions from Nlgn4 mouse models for human cells. Here, we show that the cellular and subcellular expression of human and murine Neuroligin-4 differ, with human Neuroligin-4 primarily expressed in cerebral cortex and localized to excitatory synapses. Overexpression of NLGN4 in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons resulted in an increase in excitatory synapse numbers but a remarkable decrease in synaptic strength. Human neurons carrying the syndromic autism mutation NLGN4-R704C also formed more excitatory synapses but with increased functional synaptic transmission due to a postsynaptic mechanism, while genetic loss of NLGN4 did not significantly affect synapses in the human neurons analyzed. Thus, the NLGN4-R704C mutation represents a change-of-function mutation. Our work reveals contrasting roles of NLGN4 in human and mouse neurons, suggesting that human evolution has impacted even fundamental cell biological processes generally assumed to be highly conserved."	"The SNP rs3747333 and rs3747334 in Neuroligin 4X (NLGN4X) gene have been demonstrated to be associated with the susceptibility to Autism spectrum disorder (ASDs; MIM 209850), but the results are inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis of eligible studies reporting the association between rs3747333 and rs3747334 and ASD was carried out to enhance the reliability of published results.A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library to search English articles concerning the relation between rs3747333, rs3747334 and ASD up to Sep. 21th, 2017. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the risk of rs3747333, rs3747334 in the ASD. The heterogeneity and publication bias of the eligible studies were also evaluated.Six eligible studies involving 1284 subjects (735 patients and 549 healthy controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the results indicated that there was no significant risk elevation between rs3747333, rs3747334 variants and ASD (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.10-1.60). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis confirmed this result.In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that the rs3747333, rs3747334 in NLGN4X gene are not frequent causes of ASD."	"By performing a basic case-control study among a Chinese population, the aims of this study were to explore if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within neurexin and neuroligin were associated with susceptibility to Hirschsprung's disease (HD). Eleven SNPs within neurexin and neuroligin were selected in this basic case-control study, and this study recruited 210 children with HD and 187 healthy children. The t-test and Χ<sup>2</sup> test were used to find the difference between case and control in their clinical variables. OR and 95% CI were used to assess the association between HD susceptibility and neurexin/neuroligin polymorphisms/haplotypes. Several SNPs were significantly associated with altered risk of HD in the Chinese Han population, including rs1421589 within <i>NRXN1</i>, rs11795613 and rs4844285 within <i>NLGN3,</i> as well as rs5961397, rs7157669 and rs724373 within <i>NLGX4X</i> (all P&lt;0.05). Further studies presented that the effects of rs1421589 within <i>NRXN1</i>, rs4844285 and rs11795613 within <i>NLGN3</i>, as well as rs5961397 within <i>NLGX4X</i> on HD phenotypes were also statistically significant (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusively, the polymorphisms and haplotypes situated within neurexin and neuroligin were markedly associated with the onset of HD, implying that mutations of neurexin and neuroligin might serve as the treatment target for HD for the Chinese children."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of the neurodevelopment disorders presenting as an isolated ASD or more complex forms, where a broader clinical phenotype comprised of developmental delay and intellectual disability is present. Both the isolated and complex forms have a significant causal genetic component and submicroscopic genomic copy number variations (CNV) are the most common identifiable genetic factor in these patients. The data on microarray testing in ASD cohorts are still accumulating and novel loci are often identified; therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the method and the relevance of implementing it into routine genetic testing in ASD patients. A genome-wide CNV analysis using the Agilent microarrays was performed in a group of 150 individuals with an isolated or complex ASD. Altogether, 11 (7.3%) pathogenic CNVs and 15 (10.0%) variants of unknown significance (VOUS) were identified, with the highest proportion of pathogenic CNVs in the subgroup of the complex ASD patients (14.3%). An interesting case of previously unreported partial UPF3B gene deletion was identified among the pathogenic CNVs. Among the CNVs with unknown significance, four VOUS involved genes with possible correlation to ASD, namely genes SNTG2, PARK2, CADPS2 and NLGN4X. The diagnostic efficacy of aCGH in our cohort was comparable with those of the previously reported and identified an important proportion of genetic ASD cases. Despite the continuum of published studies on the CNV testing in ASD cohorts, a considerable number of VOUS CNVs is still being identified, namely 10.0% in our study."	"Prenatal exposure to androgens during brain development in male individuals may participate to increase their susceptibility to develop neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. However, little is known about the action of androgens in human neural cells.We used human neural stem cells differentiated from embryonic stem cells to investigate targets of androgens.RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) leads to subtle but significant changes in the expression of about 200 genes, encoding proteins of extracellular matrix or involved in signal transduction of growth factors (e.g., insulin/insulin growth factor 1). We showed that the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs), RGCC, RNF144B, NRCAM, TRIM22, FAM107A, IGFBP5, and LAMA2, are reproducibly regulated by different androgens in different genetic backgrounds. We showed, by overexpressing the androgen receptor in neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y or knocking it down in human neural stem cells, that this regulation involves the androgen receptor. A chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with direct sequencing analysis identified androgen receptor-bound sequences in nearly half of the DHT-DEGs and in numerous other genes. DHT-DEGs appear enriched in genes involved in ASD (ASXL3, NLGN4X, etc.), associated with ASD (NRCAM), or differentially expressed in patients with ASD (FAM107A, IGFBP5). Androgens increase human neural stem cell proliferation and survival in nutrient-deprived culture conditions, with no detectable effect on regulation of neurite outgrowth.We characterized androgen action in neural progenitor cells, identifying DHT-DEGs that appear to be enriched in genes related to ASD. We also showed that androgens increase proliferation of neuronal precursors and protect them from death during their differentiation in nutrient-deprived conditions."	"The molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression and metastasis still remain unclear to date. It is a heterogeneous disease featuring several different phenotypes with consistently different biological characteristics. Neuroligins are neural cell adhesion molecules that have been implicated in heterotopic cell adhesion. In humans, alterations in neuroligin genes are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases. Until recently, neuroligins have been shown to be abundantly expressed in blood vessels and also play a role implicated in the growth of glioma cells. Here we report increased expression of neuroligin 4X (NLGN4X) in breast cancer. We found NLGN4X was abundantly expressed in breast cancer tissues. NLGN4X expression data for all breast cancer cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) was analyzed. Correlation between NLGN4X levels and clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed within Oncomine datasets. Evaluation of these bioinfomatic datasets results revealed that NLGN4X expression was higher in triple negative breast cancer cells, particularly the basal subtype and tissues versus non-triple-negative sets. Its level was also observed to be higher in metastatic tissues. RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence study of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells validated that NLGN4X was increased in MDA-MB-231. Knockdown of NLGN4X expression by siRNA decreased cell proliferation and migration significantly in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. NLGN4X knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by annexin staining, elevated caspase 3/7 and cleaved PARP by flow cytometry. High NLGN4X expression highly correlated with decrease in relapse free-survival in TNBC. NLGN4X might represent novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Inhibition of NLGN4X may be a new target for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer."	"We conducted a direct test of an immunological explanation of the finding that gay men have a greater number of older brothers than do heterosexual men. This explanation posits that some mothers develop antibodies against a Y-linked protein important in male brain development, and that this effect becomes increasingly likely with each male gestation, altering brain structures underlying sexual orientation in their later-born sons. Immune assays targeting two Y-linked proteins important in brain development-protocadherin 11 Y-linked (PCDH11Y) and neuroligin 4 Y-linked (NLGN4Y; isoforms 1 and 2)-were developed. Plasma from mothers of sons, about half of whom had a gay son, along with additional controls (women with no sons, men) was analyzed for male protein-specific antibodies. Results indicated women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. In addition, after statistically controlling for number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons. The results suggest an association between a maternal immune response to NLGN4Y and subsequent sexual orientation in male offspring."	"Characterisation of mouse pluripotent stem cells has revealed two distinct pluripotent states, naive and primed, that maintain characteristics of the pre and post implanted epiblast respectively. Recent studies have developed several culture systems that seek to recapitulate the naive phenomenon in human pluripotent stem cells. Therefore, robust methods to isolate these cells will be fundamental to assess their potential in modelling human development and disease. Here we review current methods for human naive pluripotent culture and collate a list of cell surface antigens that have been identified as markers to differentiate naive from primed human pluripotent stem cells. While these culture systems do display marker variability, and not all antigens mentioned were assessed in all methods, this review provides a resource for researchers of the human naive pluripotent stem cell state. SSEA-4, SSEA-3, CD24, CD75, CD7, CD77, CD130/GP130, CD57, CD90 and NLGN4X were all found to have a +/- expression profile in at least 2 methods, while +/- expression of Tra-1-81, CDH3, CD172a, CD107b, CD229 was reported in one method. Often it was reported that naive and primed cells could be defined using a low/medium/high expression of the following antigens TRA-1-60, PCDH1, GPR64, MHC Class I, however these markers were more likely to display expression pattern differences between methods. Studies using mouse naive cells indicate that they may have benefits over primed cells in modelling development and disease, and while it is yet to be determined if the same can be said about a human naive state, tools to identify this population should greatly further the field."	"We have applied a combined computational procedure based on inverse and direct docking in order to identify putative protein targets of a panel of mycotoxins and xenobiotic compounds that can contaminate food and that are known to have several detrimental effects on human health. This procedure allowed us to identify a panel of human proteins as possible targets for aflatoxins, gliotoxin, ochratoxin A and deoxynivalenol. Steady-state fluorescence and microscale thermophoresis experiments allowed us to confirm the binding of some of these mycotoxins to acetylcholinesterase and X-linked neuroligin 4, two proteins involved in synapse activity and, particularly for the second protein, neuronal plasticity and development. Considering the possible involvement of X-linked neuroligin 4 in the etiopathogenesis of autism spectrum syndrome, this finding opens up a new avenue to explore the hypothetical role of these xenobiotic compounds in the onset of this pathology."	"Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules that interact with neurexins to regulate the fine balance between excitation and inhibition of synapses. Recently, accumulating evidence, involving mutation analysis, cellular assays, and mouse models, has suggested that neuroligin (NLGN) mutations affect synapse maturation and function. Previously, four missense variations [p.G426S (NLGN3), p.G84R (NLGN4X), p.Q162K (NLGN4X), and p.A283T (NLGN4X)] in four different unrelated patients have been identified by PCR and direct sequencing.In this study, we analyzed the functional effect of these missense variations by in vitro experiment via the stable HEK293 cells expressing wild-type and mutant neuroligin.We found that the four mutations did not significantly impair the expression of neuroligin 3 and neuroligin 4X, and also did not measurably inhibit the neurexin 1-neuroligin interaction. These variants might play a modest role in the pathogenesis of autism or might simply be unreported infrequent polymorphisms.Our data suggest that these four previously described neuroligin mutations are not primary risk factors for autism."	"What is the prevalence and functional consequence of ANOS1 (KAL1) mutations in a group of men with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH)?Three of forty-two (7.1%) patients presented ANOS1 mutations, including a novel splice site mutation leading to exon skipping and a novel contiguous gene deletion associated with ichthyosis.CHH is characterized by lack of pubertal development and infertility, due to deficient production, secretion or action of GnRH, and can be associated with anosmia/hyposmia (Kallmann syndrome, KS) or with a normal sense of smell (normosmic CHH). Mutations in the anosmin-1 (ANOS1) gene are responsible for the X-linked recessive form of KS.This cross-sectional study included 42 unrelated men with CHH (20 with KS and 22 with normosmic CHH).Patients were screened for mutations in the ANOS1 gene by DNA sequencing. Identified mutations were further investigated by RT-PCR analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis.Hemizygous mutations were identified in three (7.1%) KS cases: a novel splice acceptor site mutation (c.542-1G&gt;C), leading to skipping of exon 5 in the ANOS1 transcript in a patient with self-reported normosmia (but hyposmic upon testing); a recurrent nonsense mutation (c.571C&gt;T, p.Arg191*); and a novel 4.8 Mb deletion involving ANOS1 and eight other genes (VCX3B, VCX2, PNPLA4, VCX, STS, HDHD1, VCX3A and NLGN4X) in KS associated with ichthyosis.Objective olfactory testing was not performed in all cases of self-reported normosmia and this may have underestimated the olfactory deficits.This study further expands the spectrum of known genetic defects associated with CHH and suggests that patients with self-reported normal olfactory function should not be excluded from ANOS1 genetic testing.This study was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology. The authors have no conflicts of interest.N/A."	"Since involved in synaptic transmission and located on X-chromosome, neuroligins 3 and 4X have been studied as good positional and functional candidate genes for autism spectrum disorder pathogenesis, although contradictory results have been reported. Here, we performed a case-control study to assess the association between noncoding genetic variants in <i>NLGN3</i> and <i>NLGN4X</i> genes and autism, in an Italian cohort of 202 autistic children analyzed by high-resolution melting. The results were first compared with data from 379 European healthy controls (1000 Genomes Project) and then with those from 1061 Italian controls genotyped by Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 1M-duo. Statistical evaluations were performed using Plink v1.07, with the Omnibus multiple loci approach. According to both the European and the Italian control groups, a 6-marker haplotype on <i>NLGN4X</i> (rs6638575(G), rs3810688(T), rs3810687(G), rs3810686(C), rs5916269(G), rs1882260(T)) was associated with autism (odd ratio = 3.58, <i>p</i>-value = 2.58 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for the European controls; odds ratio = 2.42, <i>p</i>-value = 6.33 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for the Italian controls). Furthermore, several haplotype blocks at 5-, 4-, 3-, and 2-, including the first 5, 4, 3, and 2 SNPs, respectively, showed a similar association with autism. We provide evidence that noncoding polymorphisms on <i>NLGN4X</i> may be associated to autism, suggesting the key role of <i>NLGN4X</i> in autism pathophysiology and in its male prevalence."	"To understand the heterogeneity of prostate cancer (PCa) and identify novel underlying drivers, we constructed integrative molecular Bayesian networks (IMBNs) for PCa by integrating gene expression and copy number alteration data from published datasets. After demonstrating such IMBNs with superior network accuracy, we identified multiple sub-networks within IMBNs related to biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa and inferred the corresponding key drivers. The key drivers regulated a set of common effectors including genes preferentially expressed in neuronal cells. NLGN4Y-a protein involved in synaptic adhesion in neurons-was ranked as the top gene closely linked to key drivers of myogenesis subnetworks. Lower expression of NLGN4Y was associated with higher grade PCa and an increased risk of BCR. We show that restoration of the protein expression of NLGN4Y in PC-3 cells leads to decreased cell proliferation, migration and inflammatory cytokine expression. Our results suggest that NLGN4Y is an important negative regulator in prostate cancer progression. More importantly, it highlights the value of IMBNs in generating biologically and clinically relevant hypotheses about prostate cancer that can be validated by independent studies."	"Genetic factor plays a critical role in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both common variants with a small effect and rare mutations with a large effect contribute toward the genetic basis of ASD, showing the high genetic heterogeneity of ASD. Genomic rearrangements account for around 10-15% of its genetic landscape. However, they are highly individualized and each of them has a very rare frequency."	"Renewed attention has been directed to the functions of the Y chromosome in the central nervous system during early human male development, due to the recent proposed involvement in neurodevelopmental diseases. PCDH11Y and NLGN4Y are of special interest because they belong to gene families involved in cell fate determination and formation of dendrites and axon.We used RNA sequencing, immunocytochemistry and a padlock probing and rolling circle amplification strategy, to distinguish the expression of X and Y homologs in situ in the human brain for the first time. To minimize influence of androgens on the sex differences in the brain, we focused our investigation to human embryos at 8-11 weeks post-gestation.We found that the X- and Y-encoded genes are expressed in specific and heterogeneous cellular sub-populations of both glial and neuronal origins. More importantly, we found differential distribution patterns of X and Y homologs in the male developing central nervous system.This study has visualized the spatial distribution of PCDH11X/Y and NLGN4X/Y in human developing nervous tissue. The observed spatial distribution patterns suggest the existence of an additional layer of complexity in the development of the male CNS."	NA
"SMC1A"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Cortex development is controlled by temporal patterning of neural progenitor (NP) competence with sequential generation of deep and superficial layer neurons, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report a role of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3 (HNRNPA3) in regulating the division of early cortical NPs that mainly give rise to deep-layer neurons via direct neurogenesis. HNRNPA3 is highly expressed in NPs of mouse and human cortex at early stages with a unique peri-chromosome pattern. Intriguingly, down-regulation of HNRNPA3 caused chromosome disarrangement, which hindered normal separation of chromosomes during NP division, leading to mitotic delay. Furthermore, HNRNPA3 is associated with the cohesin-core subunit SMC1A and controls its association with chromosomes, implicating a mechanism for the role of HNRNPA3 in regulating chromosome segregation in dividing NPs. <i>Hnrnpa3</i> deficient mice exhibited reduced cortical thickness, especially of deep layers. Moreover, down-regulation of HNRNPA3 in cultured human cerebral organoids led to marked reduction in NPs and deep-layer neurons. Thus, this study has identified a critical role of HNRNPA3 in NP division and highlighted the relationship between mitosis progression and early neurogenesis."	"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common malignant tumor of the urinary system in males. LncRNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) has been verified to play a crucial role in progression and prognosis of PCa. However, the functional mechanism of TUG1 remains unclear with radiosensitivity of PCa.Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to measure the transcription levels of genes. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis were employed to assess cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Moreover, colony formation assay was used to measure colony survival. Western blot was performed to detect the relative proteins expression. The interaction among variables was predicted by online tool starbase, and then confirmed using the dual luciferase reporter assay. A xenograft mouse model was constructed to investigate the effect of TUG1 on tumor growth in vivo.The levels of lncRNA TUG1 and SMC1A were remarkably increased, while miR-139-5p was downregulated in PCa. Patients with high expression of TUG1 showed a lower survival rate and poor prognosis. Knockdown of TUG1 inhibited PCa cell proliferation and colony survival fraction, and promoted apoptosis. Downregulation of miR-139-5p reversed the effects of TUG1 deletion on proliferation, apoptosis and colony survival fraction in PCa cells treated with 4 Gy of X-ray radiation. Moreover, TUG1 sponged miR-139-5p to regulate SMC1A expression. SMC1A deletion blocked the effects of TUG1 on the progression of PCa cells treated with 4 Gy of X-ray radiation. The tumor volume and weight were illustriously reduced with radiation and TUG1 silencing in xenograft model.Knockdown of lncRNA TUG1 enhanced radiosensitivity in PCa via the TUG1/miR-139-5p/SMC1A axis. It may become a promising target for PCa treatment."	"Cohesin is a ring-shaped multiprotein complex that is crucial for 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation during differentiation and development. It also confers sister chromatid cohesion and facilitates DNA damage repair. Besides its core subunits SMC3, SMC1A, and RAD21, cohesin in somatic cells contains one of two orthologous STAG subunits, STAG1 or STAG2. How these variable subunits affect the function of the cohesin complex is still unclear. STAG1- and STAG2-cohesin were initially proposed to organize cohesion at telomeres and centromeres, respectively. Here, we uncover redundant and specific roles of STAG1 and STAG2 in gene regulation and chromatin looping using HCT116 cells with an auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag fused to either STAG1 or STAG2. Following rapid depletion of either subunit, we perform high-resolution Hi-C, gene expression, and sequential ChIP studies to show that STAG1 and STAG2 do not co-occupy individual binding sites and have distinct ways by which they affect looping and gene expression. These findings are further supported by single-molecule localizations via <i>direct</i> stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (<i>d</i>STORM) super-resolution imaging. Since somatic and congenital mutations of the STAG subunits are associated with cancer (STAG2) and intellectual disability syndromes with congenital abnormalities (STAG1 and STAG2), we verified STAG1-/STAG2-dependencies using human neural stem cells, hence highlighting their importance in particular disease contexts."	"Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMCs) are part of a large family of ring complexes that participates in a number of DNA transactions. Among SMCs, SMC1A gene is unique. It encodes a subunit of the cohesin-core complex that tethers sister chromatids together to ensure correct chromosome segregation in both mitosis and meiosis. As a member of the cohesin ring, SMC1A takes part in gene transcription regulation and genome organization; and it participates in the DNA Damage Repair (DDR) pathway, being phosphorylated by Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 Related (ATR) threonine/serine kinases. It is also a component of the Recombination protein complex (RC-1) involved in DNA repair by recombination. SMC1A pathogenic variants have been described in Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a human rare disease, and recently SMC1A variants have been associated with epilepsy or resembling Rett syndrome phenotype. Finally, SMC1A variants have been identified in several human cancers. In this review, our current knowledge of the SMC1A gene has been summarized."	"To detect pathogenic variant in a neonate suspected for Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS).Potential mutations of CdLS-related genes (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 and HDAC8) were detected by high-throughput target region capture and next-generation sequencing. Suspected variants was verified by Sanger sequencing.The child was found to harbor a heterozygous splice site variant, c.6109-1G&gt;A, of the NIPBL gene. Sanger sequencing suggested that neither parent has carried the same variant, suggesting that it was de novo. The variant was unreported by HGMD and ExAC database, and was predicted to alter an acceptor splicing site. No pathogenic variants of SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 and HDAC8 genes were detected.The heterozygous c.6109-1G&gt;A splicing variant of the NIPBL gene may underlie the disease in this child. Above finding has expanded the variant spectrum of the NIPBL gene."	"RAD21 encodes a key component of the cohesin complex, and variants in RAD21 have been associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS). Limited information on phenotypes attributable to RAD21 variants and genotype-phenotype relationships is currently published. We gathered a series of 49 individuals from 33 families with RAD21 alterations [24 different intragenic sequence variants (2 recurrent), 7 unique microdeletions], including 24 hitherto unpublished cases. We evaluated consequences of 12 intragenic variants by protein modelling and molecular dynamic studies. Full clinical information was available for 29 individuals. Their phenotype is an attenuated CdLS phenotype compared to that caused by variants in NIPBL or SMC1A for facial morphology, limb anomalies, and especially for cognition and behavior. In the 20 individuals with limited clinical information, additional phenotypes include Mungan syndrome (in patients with biallelic variants) and holoprosencephaly, with or without CdLS characteristics. We describe several additional cases with phenotypes including sclerocornea, in which involvement of the RAD21 variant is uncertain. Variants were frequently familial, and genotype-phenotype analyses demonstrated striking interfamilial and intrafamilial variability. Careful phenotyping is essential in interpreting consequences of RAD21 variants, and protein modeling and dynamics can be helpful in determining pathogenicity. The current study should be helpful when counseling families with a RAD21 variation."	"The purpose of this overview is to increase the awareness of clinicians regarding the genetic causes of holoprosencephaly and to inform genetic counseling of family members. The following are the goals of this overview. GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of holoprosencephaly. GOAL 2: Review the genetic causes of holoprosencephaly. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify (when possible) the genetic cause of holoprosencephaly in a proband. GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with holoprosencephaly."	"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with NPM1 mutation is a disease driving genetic alteration with good prognosis. Although it has been suggested that NPM1 mutation induces chemo-sensitivity in leukemic cells, the underlying cause for the better survival of NPM1 mutated patients is still not clear. Mutant NPM1 AML has a unique microRNA and their target gene (mRNA) signature compared to wildtype NPM1. Dynamic regulation of miRNA-mRNA has been reported to influence the prognostic outcome. In the present study, in-silico expression data of miRNA and mRNA in AML patients was retrieved from genome data commons and differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA among NPM1 mutated (n=21) and NPM1 wildtype (n=162) cases were identified to establish a dynamic association at molecular level. In-vitro experiments using high throughput RNA sequencing were performed on human AML cells carrying NPM1 mutated and wildtype allele. The comparison of in-vitro transcriptomics data with in-silico miRNA-mRNA expression network data revealed down regulation of SMC1A. On establishing miRNA-mRNA interactive pairs it has been observed that hsa-mir-215-5p (LogFC: 0.957; p=0.0189) is involved in the downregulation of SMC1A (LogFC: -0.481; p=0.0464) in NPM1 mutated AML. We demonstrated that transient expression of NPM1 mutation upregulates miR- 215-5p that results in downregulation of SMC1A. We have also shown using a rescue experiment neutralizing miR-215-5p reverse the effect of NPM1 mutation on SMC1A. Using the leukemic blasts from AML patients, we observed higher expression of miR-215-5p and lower expression of SMC1A in NPM1 mutated patients compared to wild type cases. The overall survival of AML patients was significantly inferior in SMC1A high expressers as compared to low expressers (20.3% vs. 58.5%, p=0.018). The data suggest that dynamic miR-215-SMC1A regulation is potentially modulated by NPM1 mutation, which might serve as an explanation for the better outcome in NPM1 mutated AML."	"Micronuclei are small, extranuclear bodies that are distinct from the primary cell nucleus. Micronucleus formation is an aberrant event that suggests a history of genotoxic stress or chromosome mis-segregation events. Accordingly, assays evaluating micronucleus formation serve as useful tools within the fields of toxicology and oncology. Here, we describe a novel micronucleus formation assay that utilizes a high-throughput imaging platform and automated image analysis software for accurate detection and rapid quantification of micronuclei at the single cell level. We show that our image analysis parameters are capable of identifying dose-dependent increases in micronucleus formation within three distinct cell lines following treatment with two established genotoxic agents, etoposide or bleomycin. We further show that this assay detects micronuclei induced through silencing of the established chromosome instability gene, <i>SMC1A</i>. Thus, the micronucleus formation assay described here is a versatile and efficient alternative to more laborious cytological approaches, and greatly increases throughput, which will be particularly beneficial for large-scale chemical or genetic screens."	"The fusion genes CBFB/MYH11 and RUNX1/RUNX1T1 block differentiation through disruption of the core binding factor (CBF) complex and are found in 10-15% of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. This AML subtype is associated with a favorable prognosis; however, nearly half of CBF-rearranged patients cannot be cured with chemotherapy. This divergent outcome might be due to additional mutations, whose spectrum and prognostic relevance remains hardly defined. Here, we identify nonsilent mutations, which may collaborate with CBF-rearrangements during leukemogenesis by targeted sequencing of 129 genes in 292 adult CBF leukemia patients, and thus provide a comprehensive overview of the mutational spectrum ('mutatome') in CBF leukemia. Thereby, we detected fundamental differences between CBFB/MYH11- and RUNX1/RUNX1T1-rearranged patients with ASXL2, JAK2, JAK3, RAD21, TET2, and ZBTB7A being strongly correlated with the latter subgroup. We found prognostic relevance of mutations in genes previously known to be AML-associated such as KIT, SMC1A, and DHX15 and identified novel, recurrent mutations in NFE2 (3%), MN1 (4%), HERC1 (3%), and ZFHX4 (5%). Furthermore, age &gt;60 years, nonprimary AML and loss of the Y-chromosomes are important predictors of survival. These findings are important for refinement of treatment stratification and development of targeted therapy approaches in CBF leukemia."	"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a severe clinical syndrome defined by ovarian dysfunction in women less than 40 years old who generally manifest with infertility, menstrual disturbance, elevated gonadotrophins, and low estradiol levels. <i>STAG3</i> is considered a genetic aetiology of POI, which facilitates entry of REC8 into the nucleus of a cell and plays an essential role in gametogenesis. At present, only six truncated variants associated with POI have been reported; there have been no reports of an in-frame variant of <i>STAG3</i> causing POI. In this study, two novel homozygous in-frame variants (c.877_885del, p.293_295del; c.891_893dupTGA, p.297_298insAsp) in <i>STAG3</i> were identified in two sisters with POI from a five-generation consanguineous Han Chinese family. To evaluate the effects of these two variants, we performed fluorescence localization and co-immunoprecipitation analyses using <i>in vitro</i> cell model. The two variants were shown to be pathogenic, as neither STAG3 nor REC8 entered nuclei, and interactions between mutant STAG3 and REC8 or SMC1A were absent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on in-frame variants of <i>STAG3</i> that cause POI. This finding extends the spectrum of variants in <i>STAG3</i> and sheds new light on the genetic origins of POI."	"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a severe genetic disorder characterised by multisystemic malformations. CdLS is due to pathogenetic variants in <i>NIPBL</i>, <i>SMC1A</i>, <i>SMC3</i>, <i>RAD21</i> and <i>HDAC8</i> genes which belong to the cohesin pathway. Cohesin plays a pivotal role in chromatid cohesion, gene expression, and DNA repair. In this review, we will discuss how perturbations in those biological processes contribute to CdLS phenotype and will emphasise the state-of-art of CdLS therapeutic approaches."	"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the effects of miR-23a-3p on proliferation, migration and apoptosis on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells by targeting SMC1A. <b>Methods:</b> Microarray analysis was used to screen differentially expressed microRNAs and mRNAs in human AML cells. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qRCR) was used to detect the expressions of miR-23a-3p and SMCA in human AML cell line U937. TargetScan database was used to analyze the correlation between miR-23a-3p and SMC1A. Double luciferase reporter gene was used to detect the interaction between miR-23a-3p and SMC1A. The effect of miR-23a-3p expression on the proliferation of U937 cells was detected by clonal assay. The migration, apoptosis, cell cycle and caspase-3 activity of U937 cells regulated by miR-23a-3p were detected by cell scratch assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 in U937 cells. <b>Results:</b> Compared with human normal monocyte SC group (1.00), the expression of miR-23a-3p in U937 cells was up-regulated (2.56±0.78) (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), while the expression of SMC1A was down-regulated (0.48±0.56, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). miR-23a-3p specifically bond to SMC1A 3'UTR and regulated the expression activity of SMC1A. Overexpression of miR-23a-3p promoted the proliferation and migration of U937 cells and inhibited the apoptosis of U937 cells, while up-regulation of SMC1A inhibited the proliferation and migration of U937 cells and promoted the apoptosis of U937 cells. The percentages of G(0)/G1 phase, G(2)/M phase and S phase cells in the negative control group were (37.48±0.21)%, (16.78±0.18)% and (45.74±0.15)% respectively, and those in the miR-23a-3p mimics group were (19.96±0.11)%, (41.69±0.24)% and (38.24±0.34)%, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The proportions of G(0)/G(1) phase, G(2)/M phase and S phase cells in the group of miR-23a-3p mimics+ pcDNA3.1-SMC1A were (36.88±0.21)%, (30.44±0.33)% and (32.88±0.16)%, respectively, without significant difference when compared with those of the miR-23a-3p mimics group (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The relative expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 protein in the negative control group were 0.55±0.45 and 0.31±0.54, respectively. Overexpression of miR-23a-3p inhibited the expression of Bax protein in U937 cells (0.23±0.13, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), promoted the expression of Bcl-2 protein (0.50±0.23, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), while SMC1A increased the expression of Bax protein in U937 cells (0.40±0.11, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 protein (0.37±0.15). In the negative control group, caspase-3 activity was (25.82±0.89)%. Overexpression of miR-23a-3p inhibited caspase-3 activity in U937 cells (3.64±0.56)%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01, while up-regulation of SMC1A promoted caspase-3 activity in U937 cells (15.29±0.85)%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01. <b>Conclusion:</b> miR-23a-3p can inhibit the proliferation and migration and promote apoptosis of human AML cells by targeting SMC1A."	"The ankyrin repeat domain-55 (<i>ANKRD55</i>) gene contains intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk to contract multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorders. Risk alleles of these SNPs are associated with higher levels of ANKRD55 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The biological function of ANKRD55 is unknown, but given that ankyrin repeat domains constitute one of the most common protein-protein interaction platforms in nature, it is likely to function in complex with other proteins. Thus, identification of its protein interactomes may provide clues. We identified ANKRD55 interactomes via recombinant overexpression in HEK293 or HeLa cells and mass spectrometry. One hundred forty-eight specifically interacting proteins were found in total protein extracts and 22 in extracts of sucrose gradient-purified nuclei. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the ANKRD55-protein partners from total protein extracts were related to nucleotide and ATP binding, enriched in nuclear transport terms and associated with cell cycle and RNA, lipid and amino acid metabolism. The enrichment analysis of the ANKRD55-protein partners from nuclear extracts is related to sumoylation, RNA binding, processes associated with cell cycle, RNA transport, nucleotide and ATP binding. The interaction between overexpressed ANKRD55 isoform 001 and endogenous RPS3, the cohesins SMC1A and SMC3, CLTC, PRKDC, VIM, β-tubulin isoforms, and 14-3-3 isoforms were validated by western blot, reverse immunoprecipitaton and/or confocal microscopy. We also identified three phosphorylation sites in ANKRD55, with S436 exhibiting the highest score as likely 14-3-3 binding phosphosite. Our study suggests that ANKRD55 may exert function(s) in the formation or architecture of multiple protein complexes, and is regulated by (de)phosphorylation reactions. Based on interactome and subcellular localization analysis, ANKRD55 is likely transported into the nucleus by the classical nuclear import pathway and is involved in mitosis, probably via effects associated with mitotic spindle dynamics."	"Preservation and development of life depend on the adequate segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis. This process is ensured by the cohesin multi-subunit complex. Mutations in this complex have been associated with an increasing number of diseases, termed cohesinopathies. The best characterized cohesinopathy is Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), in which intellectual and growth retardations are the main phenotypic manifestations. Despite some overlap, the clinical manifestations of cohesinopathies vary considerably. Novel roles of the cohesin complex have emerged during the past decades, suggesting that important cell cycle regulators exert important biological effects through non-cohesion-related functions and broadening the potential pathomechanisms involved in cohesinopathies. This review focuses on non-cohesion-related functions of the cohesin complex, gene dosage effect, epigenetic regulation and TGF-β in cohesinopathy context, especially in comparison to <i>                        <u>C</u>                    </i>hronic <i>                        <u>A</u>                    </i>trial and <i>                        <u>I</u>                    </i>ntestinal <i>                        <u>D</u>                    </i>ysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome, a very distinct cohesinopathy caused by a homozygous Shugoshin-1 (SGO1) mutation (K23E) and characterized by pacemaker failure in both heart (sick sinus syndrome followed by atrial flutter) and gut (chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction) with no intellectual or growth delay. We discuss the possible impact of SGO1 alterations in human pathologies and the potential impact of the SGO1 K23E mutation in the sinus node and gut development and functions. We suggest that the human phenotypes observed in CdLS, CAID syndrome and other cohesinopathies can inform future studies into the less well-known non-cohesion-related functions of cohesin complex genes. <b>Abbreviations</b>: AD: Alzheimer Disease; AFF4: AF4/FMR2 Family Member 4; ANKRD11: Ankyrin Repeat Domain 11; APC: Anaphase Promoter Complex; ASD: Atrial Septal Defect; ATRX: ATRX Chromatin Remodeler; ATRX: Alpha Thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome; BIRC5: Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5; BMP: Bone Morphogenetic Protein; BRD4: Bromodomain Containing 4; BUB1: BUB1 Mitotic Checkpoint Serine/Threonine Kinase; CAID: Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia; CDK1: Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1; CdLS: Cornelia de Lange Syndrome; CHD: Congenital Heart Disease; CHOPS: Cognitive impairment, coarse facies, Heart defects, Obesity, Pulmonary involvement, Short stature, and skeletal dysplasia; CIPO: Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction; c-kit: KIT Proto-Oncogene Receptor Tyrosine Kinase; CoATs: Cohesin Acetyltransferases; CTCF: CCCTC-Binding Factor; DDX11: DEAD/H-Box Helicase 11; ERG: Transcriptional Regulator ERG; ESCO2: Establishment of Sister Chromatid Cohesion N-Acetyltransferase 2; GJC1: Gap Junction Protein Gamma 1; H2A: Histone H2A; H3K4: Histone H3 Lysine 4; H3K9: Histone H3 Lysine 9; HCN4: Hyperpolarization Activated Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Potassium and Sodium Channel 4;p HDAC8: Histone deacetylases 8; HP1: Heterochromatin Protein 1; ICC: Interstitial Cells of Cajal; ICC-MP: Myenteric Plexus Interstitial cells of Cajal; ICC-DMP: Deep Muscular Plexus Interstitial cells of Cajal; I<sub>f</sub>: Pacemaker Funny Current; IP3: Inositol trisphosphate; JNK: C-Jun N-Terminal Kinase; LDS: Loeys-Dietz Syndrome; LOAD: Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease; MAPK: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase; MAU: MAU Sister Chromatid Cohesion Factor; MFS: Marfan Syndrome; NIPBL: NIPBL, Cohesin Loading Factor; OCT4: Octamer-Binding Protein 4; P38: P38 MAP Kinase; PDA: Patent Ductus Arteriosus; PDS5: PDS5 Cohesin Associated Factor; P-H3: Phospho Histone H3; PLK1: Polo Like Kinase 1; POPDC1: Popeye Domain Containing 1; POPDC2: Popeye Domain Containing 2; PP2A: Protein Phosphatase 2; RAD21: RAD21 Cohesin Complex Component; RBS: Roberts Syndrome; REC8: REC8 Meiotic Recombination Protein; RNAP2: RNA polymerase II; SAN: Sinoatrial node; SCN5A: Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 5; SEC: Super Elongation Complex; SGO1: Shogoshin-1; SMAD: SMAD Family Member; SMC1A: Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 1A; SMC3: Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 3; SNV: Single Nucleotide Variant; SOX2: SRY-Box 2; SOX17: SRY-Box 17; SSS: Sick Sinus Syndrome; STAG2: Cohesin Subunit SA-2; TADs: Topology Associated Domains; TBX: T-box transcription factors; TGF-β: Transforming Growth Factor β; TGFBR: Transforming Growth Factor β receptor; TOF: Tetralogy of Fallot; TREK1: TREK-1 K(+) Channel Subunit; VSD: Ventricular Septal Defect; WABS: Warsaw Breakage Syndrome; WAPL: WAPL Cohesin Release Factor."	"Among the blood cancers, 13% mortality is caused by Multiple myeloma (MM) type of hematological malignancy. In spite of therapeutic advances in chemotherapy treatment, still MM remains an incurable disease is mainly due to emergence of chemoresistance. At present time, FDA approved bortezomib is the first line drug for MM treatment. However, like other chemotherapy, MM patients are acquiring resistance against bortezomib. The present study aims to identify and validate bortezomib resistant protein targets in MM using iTRAQ and label free quantitative proteomic approaches. 112 differentially expressed proteins were commonly found in both approaches with similar differential expression pattern. Exportin-1 (XPO1) protein was selected for further validation as its significant high expression was observed in both iTRAQ and label free analysis. Bioinformatic analysis of these common differentially expressed proteins showed a clear cluster of proteins such as SMC1A, RCC2, CSE1, NUP88, NUP50, TPR, HSPA14, DYNLL1, RAD21 and RANBP2 being associated with XPO1. Functional studies like cell count assay, flow cytometry assay and soft agar assay proved that XPO1 knock down in RPMI 8226R cell line results in re-sensitization to bortezomib drug. The mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD013859. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematological malignancy which constitutes about 13% of all blood cell related malignancies. Chemoresistance is one of the major obstacles for the successful treatment for MM. Bortezomib is a first proteasome inhibitor drug, widely used in MM treatment. The present study aims to identify and validate bortezomib resistant protein targets in MM. Here, we identified 112 candidate proteins to be associated with bortezomib resistance using global quantitative proteomic analysis. Among these candidate proteins, we show that XPO1 plays crucial role in emerging bortezomib resistance using functional studies like cell count assay, flow cytometry assay and soft agar assay. XPO1 could be a potential therapeutic target for MM and development of inhibitors of XPO1 might help to cure MM."	"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the blood-forming cells in bone marrow characterized by persistent monocytosis. Although most patients with CMML show clonal genetic aberrations, there is no known cytogenetic or molecular genetic finding that is specific to CMML. We report a patient who had a clinical and morphological presentation consistent with CMML. The genetic work-up showed an ETV6-ABL1 fusion consequent to a 9;12 translocation, and a missense mutation in SMC1A (c.1757G&gt;A, p.Arg586Gln). The SMC1A mutations are recurrent, albeit rare, in myeloid malignancies, without an established clinical significance in CMML. ETV6-ABL1 fusion is a rare but recurrent genetic aberration found in various hematologic malignancies involving both the lymphoid and myeloid lineage, but to the best of our knowledge, CMML is an exceptionally rare presentation of ETV6-ABL1 rearranged neoplasm. ETV6-ABL1 fusion is often formed through complex rearrangements, and usually cryptic by routine G-banded chromosome analysis. The diseases associated with this rearrangement generally have an aggressive course, hence detecting or excluding this rearrangement during diagnostic work-up is critical for treatment planning."	"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare multisystem disorder with specific dysmorphic features. Pathogenic genetic variants encoding cohesion complex subunits and interacting proteins (e.g., NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8, and RAD21) are the major causes of CdLS. However, there are many clinically diagnosed cases of CdLS without pathogenic variants in these genes. To identify further genetic causes of CdLS, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 57 CdLS families, systematically evaluating both single nucleotides variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs). We identified pathogenic genetic changes in 36 out of 57 (63.2 %) families, including 32 SNVs and four CNVs. Two known CdLS genes, NIPBL and SMC1A, were mutated in 23 and two cases, respectively. Among the remaining 32 individuals, four genes (ANKRD11, EP300, KMT2A, and SETD5) each harbored a pathogenic variant in a single individual. These variants are known to be involved in CdLS-like. Furthermore, pathogenic CNVs were detected in NIPBL, MED13L, and EHMT1, along with pathogenic SNVs in ZMYND11, MED13L, and PHIP. These three latter genes were involved in diseases other than CdLS and CdLS-like. Systematic clinical evaluation of all patients using a recently proposed clinical scoring system showed that ZMYND11, MED13L, and PHIP abnormality may cause CdLS or CdLS-like."	"Marked by incomplete division of the embryonic forebrain, holoprosencephaly is one of the most common human developmental disorders. Despite decades of phenotype-driven research, 80-90% of aneuploidy-negative holoprosencephaly individuals with a probable genetic aetiology do not have a genetic diagnosis. Here we report holoprosencephaly associated with variants in the two X-linked cohesin complex genes, STAG2 and SMC1A, with loss-of-function variants in 10 individuals and a missense variant in one. Additionally, we report four individuals with variants in the cohesin complex genes that are not X-linked, SMC3 and RAD21. Using whole mount in situ hybridization, we show that STAG2 and SMC1A are expressed in the prosencephalic neural folds during primary neurulation in the mouse, consistent with forebrain morphogenesis and holoprosencephaly pathogenesis. Finally, we found that shRNA knockdown of STAG2 and SMC1A causes aberrant expression of HPE-associated genes ZIC2, GLI2, SMAD3 and FGFR1 in human neural stem cells. These findings show the cohesin complex as an important regulator of median forebrain development and X-linked inheritance patterns in holoprosencephaly."	NA
"UPF3B"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Blast exposure is common in military personnel during training and combat operations, yet biological mechanisms related to cell survival and function that coordinate recovery remain poorly understood. This study explored how moderate blast exposure influences gene expression; specifically, gene-network changes following moderate blast exposure. On day 1 (baseline) of a 10-day military training program, blood samples were drawn, and health and demographic information collected. Helmets equipped with bilateral sensors worn throughout training measured overpressure in pounds per square inch (psi). On day 7, some participants experienced moderate blast exposure (peak pressure ≥5 psi). On day 10, 3 days post-exposure, blood was collected and compared to baseline with RNA-sequencing to establish gene expression changes. Based on dysregulation data from RNA-sequencing, followed by top gene networks identified with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, a subset of genes was validated (NanoString). Five gene networks were dysregulated; specifically, two highly significant networks: (1) Cell Death and Survival (score: 42), including 70 genes, with 50 downregulated and (2) Cell Structure, Function, and Metabolism (score: 41), including 69 genes, with 41 downregulated. Genes related to ubiquitination, including neuronal development and repair: UPF1, RNA Helicase and ATPase (<i>UPF1</i>) was upregulated while UPF3 Regulator of Nonsense Transcripts Homolog B (<i>UPF3B</i>) was downregulated. Genes related to inflammation were upregulated, including AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (<i>AKT1</i>), a gene coordinating cellular recovery following TBIs. Moderate blast exposure induced significant gene expression changes including gene networks involved in (1) cell death and survival and (2) cellular development and function. The present findings may have implications for understanding blast exposure pathology and subsequent recovery efforts."	"Traditional medicinal preparations have not received global acceptance, and their therapeutic benefits remain disputed due to lack of scientific evidence on their mechanism of action. Microarray analysis has emerged as a powerful technique that can aid in understanding the complex signaling networks activated by these formulations and thereby assess their beneficial as well as adverse effects.The present work aims to investigate the differential influence of <i>ChandraprabhaVati</i>, <i>Ayurvedic</i> formulation used in the treatment of diabetes, anemia, urinary, respiratory, skin and liver disorders.The RNA from the liver of rats treated with different doses of <i>ChandraprabhaVati</i> for 28 days was isolated and studied for the genome-wide changes in the expression.The results revealed several molecular targets that could contribute to the therapeutic effects of <i>ChandraprabhaVati</i>. Several genes have been differentially expressed, among those miRNAs miR-434, miR877, and miRlet7e contribute to the anti-diabetic, anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory of CPV. The rejuvenative activity of CPV may be due to the MeOX1 and Upf3b genes. Up-regulation of Hbaa2 gene facilitates the anti-anemic effect. Interestingly gender-specific differential expressions of genes were also observed. Rab3d were found to be altered in female when compared to male animals.Thus the microarray data for the CPV treated animals has revealed molecular targets that may be responsible for the various known therapeutic effects and also identified new beneficial effects of CPV."	"X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is known to explain up to 10% of the intellectual disability in males. A large number of families in which intellectual disability is the only clinically consistent manifestation have been described. While linkage analysis and candidate gene testing were the initial approaches to find genes and variants, next generation sequencing (NGS) has accelerated the discovery of more and more XLID genes. Using NGS, we resolved the genetic cause of MRX82 (OMIM number 300518), a large Spanish Basque family with five affected males with intellectual disability and a wide phenotypic variability among them despite having the same pathogenic variant. Although the previous linkage study had mapped the locus to an interval of 7.6Mb in Xq24-Xq25 of the X chromosome, this region contained too many candidate genes to be analysed using conventional approaches. NGS revealed a novel nonsense variant: c.118C &gt; T; p.Gln40* in <i>UPF3B</i>, a gene previously implicated in XLID that encodes a protein involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Further molecular studies showed that the mRNA transcript was not completely degraded by NMD. However, UPF3B protein was not detected by conventional Western Blot analysis at least downstream of the 40 residue demonstrating that the phenotype could be due to the loss of functional protein. This is the first report of a premature termination codon before the three functional domains of the UPF3B protein and these results directly implicate the absence of these domains with XLID, autism and some dysmorphic features."	"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most lethal neoplasm worldwide. Traditional biomarkers often exploit the relationship between a certain gene and cancer progression, but they cannot predict patient survival or prognosis accurately. We aim to construct a new DNA repair-related gene signature that combines several genes to improve prognosis prediction in HCC.We selected an HCC mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) dataset (n=365) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore bioinformatics information and further screen genes. We then built a gene signature based on the Cox proportional hazards regression model.GSEA revealed that the hallmark DNA repair gene set was significantly upregulated in the tumor phenotype. A set of seven genes, namely, <i>ADA, FEN1, POLR2G, SAC3D1, SEC61A1, SF3A3</i>, and <i>UPF3B</i>, were significantly a ssociated with overall survival (OS) and used to form a gene signature. The signature risk score was calculated and used to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups. The high-risk group showed worse prognosis (log-rank test <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the prognostic performance of this risk score signature was robust in different subgroups based on clinicopathological features, with <i>p</i>-values &lt;0.05 (HR=2.38, 95% CI (confidence interval) =1.355-4.184), indicating that it can serve as an independent prognostic indicator.We developed and identified a seven-gene signature related to the DNA repair process that can predict survival in HCC. It can be used as an effective classification tool and to guide clinical treatment."	"DUX4 is a transcription factor whose misexpression in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). DUX4's transcriptional activity has been extensively characterized, but the DUX4-induced proteome remains undescribed. Here, we report concurrent measurement of RNA and protein levels in DUX4-expressing cells via RNA-seq and quantitative mass spectrometry. DUX4 transcriptional targets were robustly translated, confirming the likely clinical relevance of proposed FSHD biomarkers. However, a multitude of mRNAs and proteins exhibited discordant expression changes upon DUX4 expression. Our dataset revealed unexpected proteomic, but not transcriptomic, dysregulation of diverse molecular pathways, including Golgi apparatus fragmentation, as well as extensive post-transcriptional buffering of stress-response genes. Key components of RNA degradation machineries, including UPF1, UPF3B, and XRN1, exhibited suppressed protein, but not mRNA, levels, explaining the build-up of aberrant RNAs that characterizes DUX4-expressing cells. Our results provide a resource for the FSHD community and illustrate the importance of post-transcriptional processes in DUX4-induced pathology."	"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease characterized by preferential motor neuron death. Approximately 15% of ALS cases are familial, and mutations in the <i>fused in sarcoma</i> (<i>FUS</i>) gene contribute to a subset of familial ALS cases. FUS is a multifunctional protein participating in many RNA metabolism pathways. ALS-linked mutations cause a liquid-liquid phase separation of FUS protein in vitro, inducing the formation of cytoplasmic granules and inclusions. However, it remains elusive what other proteins are sequestered into the inclusions and how such a process leads to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. In this study, we developed a protocol to isolate the dynamic mutant FUS-positive cytoplasmic granules. Proteomic identification of the protein composition and subsequent pathway analysis led us to hypothesize that mutant FUS can interfere with protein translation. We demonstrated that the ALS mutations in FUS indeed suppressed protein translation in N2a cells expressing mutant FUS and fibroblast cells derived from FUS ALS cases. In addition, the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which is closely related to protein translation, was altered by mutant FUS. Specifically, NMD-promoting factors UPF1 and UPF3b increased, whereas a negative NMD regulator, UPF3a, decreased, leading to the disruption of NMD autoregulation and the hyperactivation of NMD. Alterations in NMD factors and elevated activity were also observed in the fibroblast cells of FUS ALS cases. We conclude that mutant FUS suppresses protein biosynthesis and disrupts NMD regulation, both of which likely contribute to motor neuron death."	"The splicing factor SRSF1 promotes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a quality control mechanism that degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs). Here we show that transcript-bound SRSF1 increases the binding of NMD factor UPF1 to mRNAs while in, or associated with, the nucleus, bypassing UPF2 recruitment and promoting NMD. SRSF1 promotes NMD when positioned downstream of a PTC, which resembles the mode of action of exon junction complex (EJC) and NMD factors. Moreover, splicing and/or EJC deposition increase the effect of SRSF1 on NMD. Lastly, SRSF1 enhances NMD of PTC-containing endogenous transcripts that result from various events. Our findings reveal an alternative mechanism for UPF1 recruitment, uncovering an additional connection between splicing and NMD. SRSF1's role in the mRNA's journey from splicing to decay has broad implications for gene expression regulation and genetic diseases."	"Faulty mRNAs with a premature stop codon (PTC) are recognized and degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Recognition of a nonsense mRNA depends on translation and on the presence of NMD-enhancing or the absence of NMD-inhibiting factors in the 3'-untranslated region. Our review summarizes our current understanding of the molecular function of the conserved NMD factors UPF3B and UPF1, and of the anti-NMD factor Poly(A)-binding protein, and their interactions with ribosomes translating PTC-containing mRNAs. Our recent discovery that UPF3B interferes with human translation termination and enhances ribosome dissociation <i>in vitro</i>, whereas UPF1 is inactive in these assays, suggests a re-interpretation of previous experiments and modification of prevalent NMD models. Moreover, we discuss recent work suggesting new functions of the key NMD factor UPF1 in ribosome recycling, inhibition of translation re-initiation and nascent chain ubiquitylation. These new findings suggest that the interplay of UPF proteins with the translation machinery is more intricate than previously appreciated, and that this interplay quality-controls the efficiency of termination, ribosome recycling and translation re-initiation."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of the neurodevelopment disorders presenting as an isolated ASD or more complex forms, where a broader clinical phenotype comprised of developmental delay and intellectual disability is present. Both the isolated and complex forms have a significant causal genetic component and submicroscopic genomic copy number variations (CNV) are the most common identifiable genetic factor in these patients. The data on microarray testing in ASD cohorts are still accumulating and novel loci are often identified; therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the method and the relevance of implementing it into routine genetic testing in ASD patients. A genome-wide CNV analysis using the Agilent microarrays was performed in a group of 150 individuals with an isolated or complex ASD. Altogether, 11 (7.3%) pathogenic CNVs and 15 (10.0%) variants of unknown significance (VOUS) were identified, with the highest proportion of pathogenic CNVs in the subgroup of the complex ASD patients (14.3%). An interesting case of previously unreported partial UPF3B gene deletion was identified among the pathogenic CNVs. Among the CNVs with unknown significance, four VOUS involved genes with possible correlation to ASD, namely genes SNTG2, PARK2, CADPS2 and NLGN4X. The diagnostic efficacy of aCGH in our cohort was comparable with those of the previously reported and identified an important proportion of genetic ASD cases. Despite the continuum of published studies on the CNV testing in ASD cohorts, a considerable number of VOUS CNVs is still being identified, namely 10.0% in our study."	"The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway detects aberrant transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) and regulates expression of 5-10% of non-aberrant human mRNAs. To date, most proteins involved in NMD have been identified by genetic screens in model organisms; however, the increased complexity of gene expression regulation in human cells suggests that additional proteins may participate in the human NMD pathway. To identify proteins required for NMD, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen against &gt;21,000 genes. Canonical members of the NMD pathway were highly enriched as top hits in the siRNA screen, along with numerous candidate NMD factors, including the conserved ICE1/KIAA0947 protein. RNAseq studies reveal that depletion of ICE1 globally enhances accumulation and stability of NMD-target mRNAs. Further, our data suggest that ICE1 uses a putative MIF4G domain to interact with exon junction complex (EJC) proteins and promotes the association of the NMD protein UPF3B with the EJC."	"About 11% of all human genetic diseases are caused by nonsense mutations that generate premature translation termination codons (PTCs) in messenger RNAs (mRNA). PTCs not only lead to the production of truncated proteins, but also often result in  decreased mRNA abundance due to  nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Although pharmacological inhibition of NMD could be an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of diseases caused by nonsense mutations, NMD also regulates the expression of 10-20% of the normal transcriptome.Here, we investigate whether NMD can be inhibited to stabilize mutant mRNAs, which may subsequently produce functional proteins, without having a major impact on the normal transcriptome. We develop antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to systematically deplete each component in the NMD pathway. We find that ASO-mediated depletion of each NMD factor elicits different magnitudes of NMD inhibition in vitro and are differentially tolerated in normal mice. Among all of the NMD factors, Upf3b depletion is well tolerated, consistent with previous reports that UPF3B is not essential for development and regulates only a subset of the endogenous NMD substrates. While minimally impacting the normal transcriptome, Upf3b-ASO treatment significantly stabilizes the PTC-containing dystrophin mRNA in mdx mice and coagulation factor IX mRNA in a hemophilia mouse model. Furthermore, when combined with reagents promoting translational read-through, Upf3b-ASO treatment leads to the production of functional factor IX protein in hemophilia mice.These data demonstrate that ASO-mediated reduction of the NMD factor Upf3b could be an effective and safe approach for the treatment of diseases caused by nonsense mutations."	"Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a highly conserved and selective RNA turnover pathway that has been subject to intense scrutiny. NMD identifies and degrades subsets of normal RNAs, as well as abnormal mRNAs containing premature termination codons. A core factor in this pathway-UPF3B-is an adaptor protein that serves as an NMD amplifier and an NMD branch-specific factor. UPF3B is encoded by an X-linked gene that when mutated causes intellectual disability and is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. Neu-Yilik <i>et al</i>. now report a new function for UPF3B: it modulates translation termination. Using a fully reconstituted <i>in vitro</i> translation system, they find that UPF3B has two roles in translation termination. First, UPF3B delays translation termination under conditions that mimic premature translation termination. This could drive more efficient RNA decay by allowing more time for the formation of RNA decay-stimulating complexes. Second, UPF3B promotes the dissociation of post-termination ribosomal complexes that lack nascent peptide. This implies that UPF3B could promote ribosome recycling. Importantly, the authors found that UPF3B directly interacts with both RNA and the factors that recognize stop codons-eukaryotic release factors (eRFs)-suggesting that UPF3B serves as a direct regulator of translation termination. In contrast, a NMD factor previously thought to have a central regulatory role in translation termination-the RNA helicase UPF1-was found to indirectly interact with eRFs and appears to act exclusively in post-translation termination events, such as RNA decay, at least <i>in vitro</i>. The finding that an RNA decay-promoting factor, UFP3B, modulates translation termination has many implications. For example, the ability of UPF3B to influence the development and function of the central nervous system may be not only through its ability to degrade specific RNAs but also through its impact on translation termination and subsequent events, such as ribosome recycling."	"Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a highly conserved and selective RNA degradation pathway that acts on RNAs terminating their reading frames in specific contexts. NMD is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmentally controlled manner, raising the possibility that it influences developmental events. Indeed, loss or depletion of NMD factors have been shown to disrupt developmental events in organisms spanning the phylogenetic scale. In humans, mutations in the NMD factor gene, UPF3B, cause intellectual disability (ID) and are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Here, we report the generation and characterization of mice harboring a null Upf3b allele. These Upf3b-null mice exhibit deficits in fear-conditioned learning, but not spatial learning. Upf3b-null mice also have a profound defect in prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating commonly deficient in individuals with SCZ and other brain disorders. Consistent with both their PPI and learning defects, cortical pyramidal neurons from Upf3b-null mice display deficient dendritic spine maturation in vivo. In addition, neural stem cells from Upf3b-null mice have impaired ability to undergo differentiation and require prolonged culture to give rise to functional neurons with electrical activity. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis of the frontal cortex identified UPF3B-regulated RNAs, including direct NMD target transcripts encoding proteins with known functions in neural differentiation, maturation and disease. We suggest Upf3b-null mice serve as a novel model system to decipher cellular and molecular defects underlying ID and neurodevelopmental disorders."	"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a cellular surveillance pathway that recognizes and degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs). The mechanisms underlying translation termination are key to the understanding of RNA surveillance mechanisms such as NMD and crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies for NMD-related diseases. Here, we have used a fully reconstituted <i>in vitro</i> translation system to probe the NMD proteins for interaction with the termination apparatus. We discovered that UPF3B (i) interacts with the release factors, (ii) delays translation termination and (iii) dissociates post-termination ribosomal complexes that are devoid of the nascent peptide. Furthermore, we identified UPF1 and ribosomes as new interaction partners of UPF3B. These previously unknown functions of UPF3B during the early and late phases of translation termination suggest that UPF3B is involved in the crosstalk between the NMD machinery and the PTC-bound ribosome, a central mechanistic step of RNA surveillance."	"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) has traditionally been described as a quality control system that rids cells of aberrant mRNAs with crippled protein coding potential. However, transcriptome-wide profiling of NMD deficient cells identified a plethora of seemingly intact mRNAs coding for functional proteins as NMD targets. This led to the view that NMD constitutes an additional post-transcriptional layer of gene expression control involved in the regulation of many different biological pathways. Here, we review our current knowledge about the role of NMD in embryonic development and tissue-specific cell differentiation. We further summarize how NMD contributes to balancing of the integrated stress response and to cellular homeostasis of splicing regulators and NMD factors through auto-regulatory feedback loops. In addition, we discuss recent evidence that suggests a role for NMD as an innate immune response against several viruses. Altogether, NMD appears to play an important role in a broad spectrum of biological pathways, many of which still remain to be discovered."	"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or NMD, is a quality control mechanism that identifies cytoplasmic mRNAs containing translational termination (stop) codons in specific contexts-either premature termination codons or unusually long 3΄ untranslated regions (UTRs)-and targets them for degradation. In recent studies, researchers in different labs have knocked out important genes involved in NMD, the up-frameshift genes Upf2 and Upf3a, and one component of chromatoid bodies, the Tudor domain-containing protein Tdrd6, and examined the consequences for spermatogenesis. Disruption of Upf2 during early stages of spermatogenesis resulted in disappearance of nearly all spermatogenic cells through loss of NMD. However, disruption of Upf2 during postmeiotic stages resulted in decreased long 3΄ UTR-mediated NMD but no interruption of exon junction-associated NMD. This difference in NMD targeting is possibly due to increased expression of Upf3a in postmeiotic germ cells that antagonizes the functions of Upf3b and somehow favors long 3΄ UTR-mediated NMD. Tying these all together, loss of Tdrd6, a structural component of the germ cell-specific cytoplasmic structures called chromatoid bodies, also resulted in loss of long 3΄ UTR-mediated NMD by interfering with UPF1/UPF2 interactions, delocalizing UPF1, and destroying chromatoid body integrity. These results suggest that chromatoid bodies play a specialized role in modulating the NMD machinery in postmeiotic spermatids."	"NMD is a highly conserved pathway that degrades specific subsets of RNAs. There is increasing evidence for roles of NMD in development. In this commentary, we focus on spermatogenesis, a process dramatically impeded upon loss or disruption of NMD. NMD requires strict regulation for normal spermatogenesis, as loss of a newly discovered NMD repressor, UPF3A, also causes spermatogenic defects, most prominently during meiosis. We discuss the unusual evolution of UPF3A, whose paralog, UPF3B, has the opposite biochemical function and acts in brain development. We also discuss the regulation of NMD during germ cell development, including in chromatoid bodies, which are specifically found in haploid germ cells. The ability of NMD to coordinately degrade batteries of RNAs in a regulated fashion during development is akin to the action of transcriptional pathways, yet has the advantage of driving rapid changes in gene expression."	"The exon junction complex (EJC) connects spliced mRNAs to posttranscriptional processes including RNA localization, transport, and regulated degradation. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of bona fide EJC binding sites across the transcriptome including all four RNA binding EJC components eIF4A3, BTZ, UPF3B, and RNPS1. Integration of these data sets permits definition of high-confidence EJC deposition sites as well as assessment of whether EJC heterogeneity drives alternative nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathways. Notably, BTZ (MLN51 or CASC3) emerges as the EJC subunit that is almost exclusively bound to sites 20-24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions, hence defining EJC positions. By contrast, eIF4A3, UPF3B, and RNPS1 display additional RNA binding sites suggesting accompanying non-EJC functions. Finally, our data show that EJCs are largely distributed across spliced RNAs in an orthodox fashion, with two notable exceptions: an EJC deposition bias in favor of alternatively spliced transcripts and against the mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins."	"Gene duplication is a major evolutionary force driving adaptation and speciation, as it allows for the acquisition of new functions and can augment or diversify existing functions. Here, we report a gene duplication event that yielded another outcome--the generation of antagonistic functions. One product of this duplication event--UPF3B--is critical for the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, while its autosomal counterpart--UPF3A--encodes an enigmatic protein previously shown to have trace NMD activity. Using loss-of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo, we discovered that UPF3A acts primarily as a potent NMD inhibitor that stabilizes hundreds of transcripts. Evidence suggests that UPF3A acquired repressor activity through simple impairment of a critical domain, a rapid mechanism that may have been widely used in evolution. Mice conditionally lacking UPF3A exhibit &quot;hyper&quot; NMD and display defects in embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Our results support a model in which UPF3A serves as a molecular rheostat that directs developmental events."	NA
"WDR45"	"complex neurodevelopmental disorder"	"Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is categorized in Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. The clinical feature of BPAN is global developmental delay in early childhood, followed rapid progression of cognitive disfunction and parkinsonism in adulthood. This case was pointed out intellectual disability at the age of 9, followed left dominant progressive parkinsonism from the age of 31. Brain MRI showed the T<sub>1</sub>-weighted signal hyperintensity of the substantia nigra with a central band of hypointensity and the T<sub>2</sub> star weighted image hypointensity of substantia nigra and globus pallidus presenting dominant at right side. DAT SPECT also showed specific binding ratio decreased dominant in right side. She was diagnosed BPAN based on her genetic test revealing a novel mutation (c.411dupT) in WDR45. No studies reported detailed parkinsonism like laterality in BPAN. This case indicates the left dominant parkinsonism was caused by right dominant iron deposition to substantia nigra and globus pallidus in view of MRI findings and DAT SPECT."	"Nearly all diseases in humans, to a certain extent, exhibit sex differences, including differences in the onset, progression, prevention, therapy, and prognosis of diseases. Accumulating evidence shows that macroautophagy/autophagy, as a mechanism for development, differentiation, survival, and homeostasis, is involved in numerous aspects of sex differences in diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. Advances in our knowledge regarding sex differences in autophagy-mediated diseases have enabled an understanding of their roles in human diseases, although the underlying molecular mechanisms of sex differences in autophagy remain largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss current advances in our insight into the biology of sex differences in autophagy and disease, information that will facilitate precision medicine.<b>Abbreviations</b>: AD: Azheimer disease; AMBRA1: autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1; APP: amyloid beta precursor protein; AR: androgen receptor; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy related; ATP6AP2: ATPase H+ transporting accessory protein 2; BCL2L1: BCL2 like 1; BECN1: beclin 1; CTSD: cathepsin D; CYP19A1: cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1; DSD: disorders of sex development; eALDI: enhancer alternate long-distance initiator; ESR1: estrogen receptor 1; ESR2: estrogen receptor 2; FYCO1: FYVE and coiled-coil domain autophagy adaptor 1; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GLA: galactosidase alpha; GTEx: genotype-tissue expression; HDAC6: histone deacetylase 6; I-R: ischemia-reperfusion; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; m6A: N6-methyladenosine; MYBL2: MYB proto-oncogene like 2; PIK3C3: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PSEN1: presenilin 1; PSEN2: presenilin 2; RAB9A, RAB9A: member RAS oncogene family; RAB9B, RAB9B: member RAS oncogene family; RAB40AL: RAB40A like; SF1: splicing factor 1; SOX9: SRY-box transcription factor 9; SRY: sex determining region Y; TFEB: transcription factor EB; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; UVRAG: UV radiation resistance associated; VDAC2: voltage dependent anion channel 2; WDR45: WD repeat domain 45; XPDS: X-linked parkinsonism and spasticity; YTHDF2: YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2."

"Opportunistic bacterial infections amongst HIV-infected individuals contribute significantly to HIV-associated mortality. The role of HIV-mediated modulation of innate mechanisms like autophagy in promoting opportunistic infections, however, remains obscure. Here we show, HIV reactivation in or infection of macrophages inhibits autophagy and helps the survival of pathogenic <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</i> and nonpathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterial strains (NTMs). The HIV-mediated impairment of xenophagy flux facilitated bacterial survival. Activation of autophagy by trehalose could induce xenophagy flux and kill intracellular <i>Mtb</i> or NTMs either during single or co-infections. Trehalose, we delineate, activates PIKFYVE leading to TFEB nuclear translocation in MCOLN1-dependent manner to induce autophagy. Remarkably, trehalose significantly reduced HIV-p24 levels in <i>ex-vivo</i>-infected PBMCs or PBMCs from treatment-naive HIV patients and also controlled mycobacterial survival within <i>Mtb</i>-infected animals. To conclude, we report leveraging of HIV-mediated perturbed host innate-immunity by opportunistic bacterial pathogens and show an attractive therapeutic strategy for HIV and associated co-morbidities.<b>Abbreviations:</b> AIDS: acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG5: autophagy related 5; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CFU: colony forming unit; CTSD: cathepsin D; CD63: CD63 molecule; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; FRET: Förster resonance energy transfer; GABARAP: gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT: glucose transporter; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; hMDMs: human monocyte derived macrophages; IL2: interleukin 2; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LC3B-II: lipidated microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B; Mtb: <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin; mRFP: monomeric red fluorescent protein; M6PR: mannose-6-phosphate receptor; NAC: N- acetyl- L -cysteine; NTM's: non-tuberculous mycobacteria; PBMC: Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells; PIKFYVE: phosphoinositide kinase; FYVE-Type Zinc Finger; PHA: phytohemagglutinin; PMA: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PtdIns(3,5)P2: Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate; <i>ptfLC3: pEGFP-mRFP-LC3</i>; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SQSTM1: sequestosome1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; MCOLN1/TRPML1: mucolipin 1; PIP4P1/TMEM55B: Human trans-membrane Protein 55B; UVRAG: UV Radiation Resistance Associate; VPS35: vacuolar protein sorting associated protein 35; WDR45: WD repeat domain 45; YCAM: Yellow Chameleon."	"West syndrome is an epilepsy syndrome characterized by repetitive epileptic spasms (ES) and hypsarrhythmia, typically leading to developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). It is considered a classic epileptic encephalopathy (EE). We designed a diagnostic sequencing panel targeting 131 genes associated with epilepsy and/or EE and screened a cohort of 45 individuals with clinical diagnosis of West syndrome. We identified disease-causing single nucleotide variants in 11 out of 45 individuals affecting genes commonly associated with West syndrome (such as CDKL5, ARX) but also in genes predominantly linked to other epileptic disorders (such as DEPDC5, SCN1A, WDR45, AARS). Panel analysis revealed copy number variants in two additional cases, comprising a 6,7 Mb Duplication on chromosome 2 including SCN2A and SCN3A and a supernumerary marker chromosome 15 leading to an overall diagnostic yield of 29% (13/45). In our cohort, individuals with a disease-causing variant had significantly more severe phenotypes with respect to DD/ID, therapy resistant epilepsy and cerebral atrophy compared to genetically unclarified cases. In addition to investigating the genotypic spectrum of West syndrome, we compared the phenotypic spectrum of clarified versus unclarified cases. Our study illustrates that West syndrome is an electroclinical syndrome caused by various genetic disorders. Individuals without detectable genetic cause might have less encephalopathy leading to a less severe course."	"<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinical and genetic features of β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN). <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of 17 patients with BPAN with WDR45 gene variants were retrospectively collected at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Peking University First Hospital, Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University and Shanghai Children's Hospital from June 2016 to December 2018, and their clinical manifestations, electroencephalogram, neuroimaging and genetics were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Seventeen cases (13 females, 4 males), aged 1.1-8.8 years, were included. The median age of seizure onset was 14.5 months, from 3 months to 24 months of age, manifested with epileptic spasm in 6 cases and focal seizures in 5 cases. Eight patients had only one seizure type and 8 patients had two or more seizure types. Nine patients had complete remission of seizures. All 16 patients with seizures had developmental delay before the seizure onset, of whom 13 patients had moderate to severe seizures. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was abnormal in 13 patients, including cerebral atrophy (10 cases) and thinning of the corpus callosum (9 cases). The brain magnetic susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) in preschool stage showed prominent T2 hypointense signals in bilateral globus pallidus and brainstem ventral in two cases. Five seizure types (spasm, focal, absence, myodonic and generalized tonic clonic seizures)were found on ictal electroencephalogram(EEG) recordings. Compared to female patients(17(6-24) months of ege), male cases had earlier seizure onset (3, 4, 5, 18 months of age) . All patients had de novo variations in WDR45(6 nonsense, 4 frameshift, 3 missense and 4 splicing variations), with hemizygous variants in 3 males, mosaic variants in a male and heterozygous variants in 13 females, within which 5 variations had not been reported (c.977-1C&gt;T,c.976+1G&gt;C,c.10C&gt;T,c.806del and c.110T&gt;C). <b>Conclusions:</b> The patients with BPAN have profound developmental delay and are vulnerable to seizures. The male patients with BPAN tend to have more severer clinical phenotype than females. Early brain SWI could facilitate the timely diagnosis of this disease."	"This report discusses a 13-year-old girl diagnosed with beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN). BPAN is an X-linked neurodegeneration disorder associated with a mutation in the WDR45 gene. It typically presents in childhood with encephalopathy, developmental delay, and seizures. Following an initial static phase, these symptoms then progress to dementia, dystonia, and parkinsonism in early adulthood. Our child initially presented with epileptic spasms, global developmental delay, speech delay, hypotonia, spasticity, scoliosis, and gait disturbance. While these symptoms remained unchanged in early childhood, they depicted accelerated deterioration at age 12-13 rather than in adulthood. Her diagnosis was made based on her clinical presentation and review of imaging that led to specific genetic testing confirming the condition. The imaging findings were of markedly low signal on gradient T2* sequences in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and T1 hyperintensity in the substantia nigra, with associated diffuse brain volume loss. Unlike other cases reported in the literature, there was no classic area of central hypointensity on T1 imaging in the substantia nigra."	"The purpose of this overview is to increase the awareness of clinicians regarding neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) disorders and their genetic causes and management. The following are the goals of this overview. GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. GOAL 2: Review the genetic causes of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. GOAL 5: Review high-level management of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation."	"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) comprises a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by progressive extrapyramidal and other neurological symptoms due to focal iron accumulation in the basal ganglia (Adidi et al., 2016). β-Propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is the most recently identified subtype of NBIA caused by heterozygous variants in WDR45 (OMIM: *300526) at Xp11.23. We report the clinical neurophysiological and neuro-imaging findings of a new subtype of BPAN in a 6 year-old female patient, who was identified to have a large de novo WDR45 deletion who presented in the first year of life with early onset global developmental delay, severe cognitive impairment, generalized hypotonia and a corticosteroid responsive epileptic encephalopathy."	"Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is caused by mutations in the autophagy gene <i>WDR45/WIPI4</i>. In human, BPAN is associated with static encephalopathy in childhood and neurodegeneration in adulthood (SENDA). It has been proposed that WDR45 mutations cause neurodegeneration due to defective autophagy. Whether these mutations cause a global attenuation or a defect in a subset of autophagy functions is unknown. Based on a recent study showing that <i>wdr45</i> knockout mice exhibit defective autophagy associated with an increased ER stress, we propose that ER-mediated autophagy, a selective activation of autophagy, is defective in mouse and cellular models of BPAN. We discuss the implication of these findings on the pathophysiological relevance of the relationship between ER stress and autophagy in BPAN as well as other neurodegenerative diseases exhibiting ER stress and defective autophagy."	"This study aimed to investigate the new genetic etiologies of Rett syndrome (RTT) or Rett-like phenotypes.Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 44 Chinese patients with RTT or Rett-like phenotypes, in whom genetic analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 was negative.The detection rate was 31.8% (14/44). A de novo pathogenic variant (c.275_276ins AA, p. Cys92*) of KIF1A was identified in a girl with all core features of typical RTT. A patient with atypical RTT was detected having de novo GRIN1 pathogenic variant (c.2337C &gt; A, p. Val793Phe). Additionally, compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of PPT1 gene were detected in a girl, who initially displayed typical RTT features, but progressed into neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) afterwards. Pathogenic variants in KCNQ2, MEF2C, WDR45, TCF4, IQSEC2, and SDHA were also found in our cohort.It is the first time that pathogenic variants of GRIN1 and KIF1A were linked to RTT and Rett-like profiles. Our findings expanded the genetic heterogeneity of Chinese RTT or Rett-like patients, and also suggest that some patients with genetic metabolic disease such as NCL, might displayed Rett features initially, and clinical follow-up is essential for the diagnosis."	" Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a very rare, X-linked dominant (XLD) inherited member of the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) disease family. We present a female case of BPAN with infantile spasms in the first year, Rett-like symptomatology, focal epilepsy, and loss of motor skills in childhood. Menarche occurred at the age of 9, after precocious pubarche and puberty.Dystonia-parkinsonism as extrapyramidal sign at the age of 10 years resulted in radiological and genetic work-up. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) measured 66/120 points in body part-related dystonia symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed dopamine depletion.T2 and B0 sequences of the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed susceptibility artifacts with NBIA-typical hypointense globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra (SN). Next-generation sequencing revealed a BPAN-causing pathogenic variant in <i>WDR45 (WD repeat-containing protein 45)</i> gene (c.830 + 1G &gt; A, XLD, heterozygous, de novo). Skewed X-inactivation was measured (2:98). Autophagy-related X-linked BPAN disease might still be underdiagnosed in female cases of infantile spasms.Skewed X-inactivation will have mainly influenced the uncommon, very early childhood neurodegenerative symptomatology in the present BPAN case. Oral levodopa substitution led to improvement in sleep disorder, hypersalivation, and swallowing.Reduced white matter and hypointense signals in SN and GP on susceptibility sequences in magnetic resonance imaging are characteristic radiological findings of advanced disease in NBIA. No BPAN-typical halo sign in T1-weighted scan at midbrain level was seen at the age of 11 years. NBIA panel is recommended for early diagnosis."	"NBIA (Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation) is a group of inherited neurologic disorders characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity, in which iron atypical accumulates in basal ganglia resulting in brain magnetic resonance imaging changes, histopathological abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric clinical symptoms. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, ten candidate genes have been identified, including PANK2, PLA2G6, C19orf12, WDR45, FA2H, ATP13A2, FTL, CP, C2orf37, and COASY. They are involved in seemingly unrelated cellular pathways, such as iron homeostasis (FTL, CP), lipid metabolism (PLA2G6, C19orf12, FA2H), Coenzyme A synthesis (PANK2, COASY), and autophagy (WDR45, ATP13A2). In particular, PANK2, COASY, PLA2G6, and C19orf12 are located on mitochondria, which associate with certain subtypes of NBIA showing mitochondria dysregulation. However, the relationships among those four genes are still unclear. Therefore, this review is specifically focused on dysregulation of mitochondria in NBIA and afore-mentioned four genes, with summaries of both pathological and clinical findings."	"Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN, OMIM 300894) is an X-linked neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in WDR45. WDR45 is required for autophagy, defect in WDR45 impaired autophagy which contributes for the pathogenesis of BPAN. Previously, we reported a novel de novo mutation (c.1040_1041del, p.Glu347GlyfsTer7) in WDR45 (NM_007075) in a 3-year-old Chinese girl with BPAN.The protein structure was constructed using SWISS-MODEL and the isoelectric point (pI) was predicted by the online pI/Mw tool at ExPASy. The functional effects of this mutation were predicted by two online software programs: PROVEN and MutationTaster. Stable overexpression of Flag-tagged wild-type or mutant WDR45 in HeLa cells was constructed. Protein levels of LC3 and p62 were analyzed by western blot upon treatment with/without autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, the formation of LC3 puncta were analyzed in HeLa cells transfected with mCherry-LC3 by confocal microscopy.The mutation resulted in a shift of pI from 6.74 to 8.84 and was predicted to be pathogenic. The protein levels of LC3-II and p62 were increased in cells overexpression of wild-type and mutant WDR45 while the protein levels were not increased in cells overexpression of mutant WDR45 upon treatment with autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1. Results from confocal microscopy revealed that LC3-positive puncta were increased in cells expressing both wild-type and mutant WDR45 while the number of LC3-positive puncta was not increased in cells expressing mutant WDR45 upon treatment with Bafilomycin A1.Our study evidenced that this novel mutation in WDR45 impaired autophagy in cells thus this mutation is the cause for BPAN in this patient."	"Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) that presents with childhood developmental delay (especially speech delay), occasionally associated with epileptic encephalopathy, autism, or Rett-like syndrome. The majority of children described to date have been severely affected, with little to no expressive speech function, severe developmental delay, and cognitive impairment. Herein, five additional patients with BPAN identified in the same center in Canada are described, four with the typical severe phenotype and one with a milder phenotype. Our findings provide further evidence that a spectrum of severity exists for this rare and newly described condition. Challenges in identifying iron accumulation on brain MRI are also addressed. Additionally, the importance of including the <i>WDR45</i> gene on epilepsy and Rett-like syndrome genetic panels is highlighted."	"Macroautophagy/autophagy functions as a quality control mechanism by degrading misfolded proteins and damaged organelles and plays an essential role in maintaining neural homeostasis. The phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) effector Atg18 is essential for autophagosome formation in yeast. Mammalian cells contain four Atg18 homologs, belonging to two subclasses, WIPI1 (WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 1), WIPI2 and WDR45B/WIPI3 (WD repeat domain 45B), WDR45/WIPI4. The role of <i>Wdr45b</i> in autophagy and in neural homeostasis, however, remains unknown. Recent human genetic studies have revealed a potential causative role of <i>WDR45B</i> in intellectual disability. Here we demonstrated that mice deficient in <i>Wdr45b</i> exhibit motor deficits and learning and memory defects. Histological analysis reveals that <i>wdr45b</i> knockout (KO) mice exhibit a large number of swollen axons and show cerebellar atrophy. SQSTM1- and ubiquitin-positive aggregates, which are autophagy substrates, accumulate in various brain regions in <i>wdr45b</i> KO mice. Double KO mice, <i>wdr45b</i> and <i>wdr45</i>, die within one day after birth and exhibit more severe autophagy defects than either of the single KO mice, suggesting that these two genes act cooperatively in autophagy. Our studies demonstrated that WDR45B is critical for neural homeostasis in mice. The <i>wdr45b</i> KO mice provide a model to study the pathogenesis of intellectual disability.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ACSF: artificial cerebrospinal fluid; AMC: aminomethylcoumarin; BPAN: beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration; CALB1: calbindin 1; CNS: central nervous system; DCN: deep cerebellar nuclei; fEPSP: field excitatory postsynaptic potential; IC: internal capsule; ID: intellectual disability; ISH: <i>in situ</i> hybridization; KO: knockout; LTP: long-term potentiation; MBP: myelin basic protein; MGP: medial globus pallidus; PtdIns3P: phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; WDR45B: WD repeat domain 45B; WIPI1: WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 1; WT: wild type."	"Mutations in the macroautophagy/autophagy gene <i>WDR45</i> cause β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN); however the molecular and cellular mechanism of the disease process is largely unknown. Here we generated constitutive <i>wdr45</i> knockout (KO) mice that displayed cognitive impairments, abnormal synaptic transmission and lesions in several brain regions. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed loss of neurons in prefrontal cortex and basal ganglion in aged mice, and increased apoptosis in prefrontal cortex, recapitulating a hallmark of neurodegeneration. Quantitative proteomic analysis showed accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins in KO mouse. At the cellular level, accumulation of ER proteins due to WDR45 deficiency resulted in increased ER stress and impaired ER quality control. The unfolded protein response (UPR) was elevated through ERN1/IRE1 or EIF2AK3/PERK pathway, and eventually led to neuronal apoptosis. Suppression of ER stress or activation of autophagy through MTOR inhibition alleviated cell death. Thus, the loss of WDR45 cripples macroautophagy machinery in neurons and leads to impairment in organelle autophagy, which provides a mechanistic understanding of cause of BPAN and a potential therapeutic strategy to treat this genetic disorder.<b>Abbreviations:</b> 7-ADD: 7-aminoactinomycin D; ASD: autistic spectrum disorder; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; ATG: autophagy-related; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BCAP31: B cell receptor associated protein 31; BPAN: β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CDIPT: CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylinositol synthase); DDIT3/CHOP: DNA-damage inducible transcript 3; EIF2A: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A; EIF2AK3/PERK: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERN1/IRE1: endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HIP: hippocampus; HSPA5/GRP78: heat shock protein family A (HSP70) member 5; KO: knockout; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane 1; mEPSCs: miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents; MG132: N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal; MIB: mid-brain; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PFA: paraformaldehyde; PFC: prefrontal cortex; PRM: parallel reaction monitoring; RBFOX3/NEUN: RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog [C. elegans] 3; RTN3: reticulon 3; SEC22B: SEC22 homolog B, vesicle trafficking protein; SEC61B: SEC61 translocon beta subunit; SEM: standard error of the mean; SNR: substantia nigra; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; Tm: tunicamycin; TMT: tandem mass tag; TUDCA: tauroursodeoxycholic acid; TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling; UPR: unfolded protein response; WDR45: WD repeat domain 45; WT: wild type; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1."	"TRAPPC11 has been implicated in membrane traffic and lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis, and mutations in TRAPPC11 result in neuromuscular and developmental phenotypes. Here, we show that TRAPPC11 has a role upstream of autophagosome formation during macroautophagy. Upon TRAPPC11 depletion, LC3-positive membranes accumulate prior to, and fail to be cleared during, starvation. A proximity biotinylation assay identified ATG2B and its binding partner WIPI4/WDR45 as TRAPPC11 interactors. TRAPPC11 depletion phenocopies that of ATG2 and WIPI4 and recruitment of both proteins to membranes is defective upon reduction of TRAPPC11. We find that a portion of TRAPPC11 and other TRAPP III proteins localize to isolation membranes. Fibroblasts from a patient with TRAPPC11 mutations failed to recruit ATG2B-WIPI4, suggesting that this interaction is physiologically relevant. Since ATG2B-WIPI4 is required for isolation membrane expansion, our study suggests that TRAPPC11 plays a role in this process. We propose a model whereby the TRAPP III complex participates in the formation and expansion of the isolation membrane at several steps."	NA
"ACTA2"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"The development of fully functional small diameter vascular grafts requires both a properly defined vessel conduit and tissue-specific cellular populations. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from the Wharton's Jelly (WJ) tissue can be used as a source for obtaining vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), while the human umbilical arteries (hUAs) can serve as a scaffold for blood vessel engineering.To develop VSMCs from WJ-MSCs utilizing umbilical cord blood platelet lysate.WJ-MSCs were isolated and expanded until passage (P) 4. WJ-MSCs were properly defined according to the criteria of the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy. Then, these cells were differentiated into VSMCs with the use of platelet lysate from umbilical cord blood in combination with ascorbic acid, followed by evaluation at the gene and protein levels. Specifically, gene expression profile analysis of VSMCs for <i>ACTA2</i>, <i>MYH11</i>, <i>TGLN</i>, <i>MYOCD</i>, <i>SOX9</i>, <i>NANOG</i> homeobox, <i>OCT4</i> and <i>GAPDH</i>, was performed. In addition, immunofluorescence against ACTA2 and MYH11 in combination with DAPI staining was also performed in VSMCs. HUAs were decellularized and served as scaffolds for possible repopulation by VSMCs. Histological and biochemical analyses were performed in repopulated hUAs.WJ-MSCs exhibited fibroblastic morphology, successfully differentiating into &quot;osteocytes&quot;, &quot;adipocytes&quot; and &quot;chondrocytes&quot;, and were characterized by positive expression (&gt; 90%) of CD90, CD73 and CD105. In addition, WJ-MSCs were successfully differentiated into VSMCs with the proposed differentiation protocol. VSMCs successfully expressed <i>ACTA2, MYH11, MYOCD, TGLN</i> and <i>SOX9</i>. Immunofluorescence results indicated the expression of ACTA2 and MYH11 in VSMCs. In order to determine the functionality of VSMCs, hUAs were isolated and decellularized. Based on histological analysis, decellularized hUAs were free of any cellular or nuclear materials, while their extracellular matrix retained intact. Then, repopulation of decellularized hUAs with VSMCs was performed for 3 wk. Decellularized hUAs were repopulated efficiently by the VSMCs. Biochemical analysis revealed the increase of total hydroyproline and sGAG contents in repopulated hUAs with VSMCs. Specifically, total hydroxyproline and sGAG content after the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> wk was 71 ± 10, 74 ± 9 and 86 ± 8 μg hydroxyproline/mg of dry tissue weight and 2 ± 1, 3 ± 1 and 3 ± 1 μg sGAG/mg of dry tissue weight, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed between all study groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).VSMCs were successfully obtained from WJ-MSCs with the proposed differentiation protocol. Furthermore, hUAs were efficiently repopulated by VSMCs. Differentiated VSMCs from WJ-MSCs could provide an alternative source of cells for vascular tissue engineering."	"Whether glucocorticoids (GC) can directly affect human testicular functions is not well understood. A predominant site of GC receptor (GR; <i>NR3C1</i>) expression in the adult testis are peritubular smooth muscle-like cells, which express smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), contract and thereby are involved in sperm transport. In contrast to the adult, neither GR nor ACTA2, or elastin (ELN) were detected in the peritubular compartment before puberty in non-human primate testes. In isolated human testicular peritubular cells (HTPCs), activation of GR by dexamethasone (Dex) caused the translocation of GR to the nucleus and stimulated expression of <i>ACTA2</i> and <i>ELN</i>, without affecting the expression of collagens. Cytoskeletal ACTA2-rearrangements were observed and were associated with an increased ability to contract. Our results indicate post-pubertal testicular roles of GC in the maintenance of the contractile, smooth muscle-like phenotype of peritubular cells."	"Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening disease, of which genetic abnormalities are considered as important risk factors. The present research aims at identifying causal variants in Chinese patients with sporadic non-syndromic type A TAAD (ATAAD).Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 73 sporadic Chinese patients with ATAAD, 30 TAAD associated genes were curated for bioinformatic analyses. Clinical differences were compared between patients with and without causal variants.15 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified (8 novel and 7 previously described) in 4 known TAAD-causal genes (FBN1, TGFBR2, SMAD3 and ACTA2) in 15 individuals, including 11 variants in FBN1 (7 missense, 3 truncating, and 1 splicing variants), 2 missense variants in TGFBR2, 1 ACTA2 frameshift variant and 1 SMAD3 frameshift variant. Significant clinical differences were found between patients with and without causal variants. Patients with TAAD-causal variants proved to have an earlier onset age, a more dilated aorta, and relatively intractable subtypes. Even without risk factor like hypertension, they might still suffer from TAAD with TAAD-causal variants.The variants identified in our research might not only result in the occurrence of ATAAD, but also add complexities and difficulties to the clinical practice. Our data demonstrated that WES was an effective tool for determining genetic etiologies of non-syndromic ATAAD and could be helpful in genetic counseling for ATAAD patients and their at-risk family members."	"In utero exposure to obesity is consistently associated with increased risk of metabolic disease, obesity and cardiovascular dysfunction in later life despite the divergence of birth weight outcomes. The placenta plays a critical role in offspring development and long-term health, as it mediates the crosstalk between the maternal and fetal environments. However, its phenotypic and molecular modifications in the context of maternal obesity associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR) remain poorly understood.Using a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity, we investigated changes in the placental transcriptome through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) at embryonic day (E) 19. The most differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt; 0.05) were validated by Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in male and female placentae at E19. The expression of these targets and related genes was also determined by qPCR at E13 to examine whether the observed alterations had an earlier onset at mid-gestation. Structural analyses were performed using immunofluorescent staining against Ki67 and CD31 to investigate phenotypic outcomes at both timepoints.RNA-seq and IPA analyses revealed differential expression of transcripts and pathway interactions related to placental vascular development and tissue morphology in obese placentae at term, including downregulation of Muc15, Cnn1, and Acta2. Pdgfb, which is implicated in labyrinthine layer development, was downregulated in obese placentae at E13. This was consistent with the morphological evidence of reduced labyrinth zone (LZ) size, as well as lower fetal weight at both timepoints irrespective of offspring sex.Maternal obesity results in abnormal placental LZ development and impaired vascularization, which may mediate the observed FGR through reduced transfer of nutrients across the placenta."	"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by an abundance of stroma. Multiple molecular classification efforts have identified a mesenchymal tumor subtype that is consistently characterized by high-grade growth and poor clinical outcome. The relation between PDAC stroma and tumor subtypes is still unclear. Here, we aimed to identify how PDAC cells instruct the main cellular component of stroma, the pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). We found in primary tissue that high-grade PDAC had reduced collagen deposition compared to low-grade PDAC. Xenografts and organotypic co-cultures established from mesenchymal-like PDAC cells featured reduced collagen and activated PSC content. Medium transfer experiments using a large set of PDAC cell lines revealed that mesenchymal-like PDAC cells consistently downregulated ACTA2 and COL1A1 expression in PSCs and reduced proliferation. We identified colony-stimulating factor 1 as the mesenchymal PDAC-derived ligand that deactivates PSCs, and inhibition of its receptor CSF1R was able to counteract this effect. In conclusion, high-grade PDAC features stroma that is low in collagen and activated PSC content, and targeting CSF1R offers direct options to maintain a tumor-restricting microenvironment."	"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a small teleost fish that is becoming increasingly popular in laboratories worldwide and several attributes have also placed the zebrafish under the spotlight of (eco)toxicological studies. Since the 1990s, international organizations such as ISO and OECD have published guidelines for the use of zebrafish in ecotoxicological assessment of environmental toxicants such as the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) test, OECD n° 236 guideline. This protocol uses 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), an aniline pesticide whose toxicity to fish species at early life stages is well known, as a positive control. Despite its use, little is known about its molecular mechanisms, especially in the context of the FET test. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate such changes in zebrafish larvae exposed to DCA (4 mg/L) for 96 hours using gel-free proteomics. Twenty-four proteins detected in both groups were identified as significantly affected by DCA exposure, and, when considering group-specific entities, 48 proteins were exclusive to DCA (group-specific proteins) while 248 were only detected in the control group. Proteins modulated by DCA treatment were found to be involved in metabolic processes, especially lipids and hormone metabolism (eg, Apoa1 and Apoa1b and vitelogenins), as well as proteins important for developmental processes and organogenesis (eg, Myhc4, Acta2, Sncb, and Marcksb). The results presented here may therefore provide a better understanding of the relationships between molecular changes and phenotype in zebrafish larvae treated with DCA, the reference compound of the FET test."	"Breed improvement is an important genetic process affecting meat quality. Compared with Kazakh cattle, Xinjiang brown cattle have significantly improved carcass quality and meat quality. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the improvements in Xinjiang brown cattle and the differences in beef quality between the two breeds, we used RNA-Seq to study differentially expressed genes and miRNAs and regulatory pathways related to adipogenesis, myogenesis and fibrogenesis in the longissimus dorsi muscles of Xinjiang brown cattle and Kazakh cattle. The results showed that 1669 genes were differentially expressed in the longissimus dorsi muscle tissues of Xinjiang brown cattle and Kazakh cattle; 879 genes were upregulated and 790 genes were downregulated in Xinjiang brown cattle compared to Kazakh cattle. These genes were mainly involved in PPAR signaling, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and vascular smooth muscle contraction. Additionally, 346 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 265 miRNAs were downregulated and 81 miRNAs were upregulated in Xinjiang brown cattle compared to Kazakh cattle. Association analysis of the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs revealed that 86 differentially expressed miRNAs related to adipogenesis were associated with 31 differentially expressed genes, 76 differentially expressed miRNAs associated with myogenesis were associated with 28 differentially expressed genes, and 54 differentially expressed miRNAs associated with fibrogenesis were associated with 19 differentially expressed genes. miRNA-target gene networks were also constructed. Finally, the expression levels of 19 genes and miRNAs were verified by qRT-PCR. Some differentially expressed genes, including FABP4, ACTA2 and ACTG2, were shown to play an important role in beef meat quality. This is the first study to perform transcriptomic analysis of muscle tissues from Xinjiang brown and Kazakh cattle."	"Pantoea agglomerans is gram-negative bacteria widely distributed in nature. It predominates in inhalable dust from grain, herbs, and flax, and was identified as the most important cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in eastern Poland. To better understand the molecular mechanism of HP development studies focused on the interactions between P. agglomerans and alveolar epithelial cells as well as lung tissue with particular emphasis on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The studies were conducted on human normal lung epithelial NL20 cells and mice strain C57BL/6J. Cells and mice underwent chronic exposure to saline extract of P. agglomerans (SE-PA). Morphological changes were evaluated under light microscopy, the concentration of fibrosis markers was examined by the ELISA method, while the expression of genes involved in EMT was evaluated by RealTime PCR. During incubation with SE-PA epithelial cells underwent conversion and assumed fibroblast phenotype characterized by a decrease in epithelial cells markers (CDH1, CLDN1, JUP) and increase in mesenchymal cells markers (FN1, VIM, CDH2). Mice lungs collected after 14 days of SE-PA treatment revealed inflammation with marked lymphocytes infiltration. The intensified inflammatory process accompanied by increased proliferation of fibrous connective tissue was noted in mice lungs after 28 days of SE-PA exposure. Histological changes correlated with an increase of fibrosis markers (hydroxyproline, collagens), downregulation of epithelial markers (Cdh1, Cldn1, Jup, Ocln) and upregulation of myofibroblasts markers (Acta2, Cdh2, Fn1, Vim). Obtained results revealed SE-PA ability to induce EMT in human lung epithelial cells and mice lung tissue, with the scale of changes proportional to the time of treatment."	"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the expression of type Ⅰ collagen α1 chain protein (COL1A1) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and its relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis of TNBC. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 148 TNBC specimens were collected from the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from 2013 to 2015. The mRNA expression of COL1A1 was detected by fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR and the protein expression of COL1A1 was detected by Western blot. The expression of COL1A1 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in TNBC were detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the expression of COL1A1 and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of TNBC patients was analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The mRNA and protein expression of COL1A1 in MDA-MB-231 cells were 1.696±0.486 and 0.550±0.088, respectively, which were higher than those in MCF-10A cells (1.020±0.231 and 0.350±0.083, <i>P</i>=0.032, <i>P</i>=0.046). The mRNA and protein expression of COL1A1 in TNBC tissues were 1.632 ±0.598 and 0.733 ±0.068, respectively, which were higher than those in paracancerous tissues (1.041±0.316 and 0.612±0.016, <i>P</i>=0.003, <i>P</i>=0.039). The high expression rates of COL1A1 and α-SMA in TNBC tissues were 35.8% and 56.7% respectively, which were higher than those in paracancerous tissues (16.7% and 30.0%, <i>P</i>=0.041, <i>P</i>=0.037). The expression of COL1A1 was correlated with tumor size, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and α-SMA expression (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The median survival time in COL1A1 high expression group was 64 months, which was lower than that in low expression group (73 months, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Multivariate analysis of Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that COL1A1 expression was an independent influencing factor for the survival of TNBC patients (<i>HR</i>=3.952, <i>P</i>=0.004). <b>Conclusion:</b> The high expression of COL1A1 in TNBC is an independent prognostic factor of TNBC patients."	"The dense formation of abnormal scar tissue after total knee arthroplasty results in arthrofibrosis, an unfortunate sequela of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to use a validated rabbit model to assess the effects on surgically-induced knee joint contractures of two combined pharmacological interventions: celecoxib (CXB) loaded on an implanted collagen membrane, and subcutaneously (SQ) injected ketotifen. Thirty rabbits were randomly divided into five groups. The first group received no intervention after the index surgery. The remaining four groups underwent intra-articular implantation of collagen membranes loaded with or without CXB at the time of the index surgery; two of which were also treated with SQ ketotifen. Biomechanical joint contracture data were collected at 8, 10, 16, and 24 weeks. At the time of necropsy (24 weeks), posterior capsule tissue was collected for messenger RNA and histopathologic analyses. At 24 weeks, there was a statistically significant increase in passive extension among rabbits in all groups treated with CXB and/or ketotifen compared to those in the contracture control group. There was a statistically significant decrease in COL3A1, COL6A1, and ACTA2 gene expression in the treatment groups compared to the contracture control group (P &lt; .001). Histopathologic data also demonstrated a trend towards decreased fibrous tissue density in the CXB membrane group compared to the vehicle membrane group. The present data suggest that intra-articular placement of a treated collagen membrane blunts the severity of contracture development in a rabbit model of arthrofibrosis, and that ketotifen and CXB may independently contribute to the prevention of arthrofibrosis. Statement of clinical significance: Current literature has demonstrated that arthrofibrosis may affect up to 5% of primary total knee arthroplasty patients. For that reason, novel pharmacologic prophylaxis and treatment modalities are critical to mitigating reoperations and revisions while improving the quality of life for patients with this debilitating condition."	"The tumour microenvironment comprises a diverse range of cells, including fibroblasts, immune cells and endothelial cells, along with extracellular matrix. In particular, fibroblasts are of significant interest as these cells are reprogrammed during tumorigenesis to become cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which in turn support cancer cell growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be involved in this intercellular crosstalk in humans. To assess whether miRNAs are also involved in the activation of fibroblasts in dogs, we cocultured primary canine skin fibroblasts with the canine mast cell tumour cell line C2 directly or with C2-derived exosomes, and measured differential abundance of selected miRNAs. Expression of the CAF markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and stanniocalcin 1 confirmed the activation of our fibroblasts after coculture. We show that fibroblasts displayed significant downregulation of miR-27a and let-7 family members. These changes correlated with significant upregulation of predicted target mRNAs. Furthermore, RNA interference knockdown of miR-27a revealed that cyclin G1 (CCNG1) exhibited negative correlation at the mRNA and protein level, suggesting that CCNG1 is a target of miR-27a in canine fibroblasts and involved in their activation. Importantly, miR-27a knockdown itself resulted in fibroblast activation, as demonstrated by the formation of ACTA2 filaments. In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly induced in our fibroblasts when cocultured, indicating potential reciprocal signalling. Taken together, our findings are consistent with canine fibroblasts being reprogrammed into CAFs to further support cancer development and that downregulation of miR-27a may play an important role in the tumour-microenvironment crosstalk."	"Congenital mydriasis and retinal arteriolar tortuosity are associated with the life-threatening multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (MSMDS) due to mutations in the gene, ACTA2, which encodes alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Previous reports attributed MSMDS-related congenital mydriasis to the absence of iris sphincter muscle. Similarly, it has been hypothesized that abnormal proliferation of the vascular smooth muscle cells causes the marked tortuosity of retinal arterioles in MSMDS. In this report, high-resolution ocular imaging reveals unexpected findings that reject previous hypotheses.The proband is a 37-year-old female with a history of neonatal patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation, left-sided choreiform movements at the age of 11 and a transient aphasia with right-sided weakness at the age of 30. Her older sister also had PDA ligation and congenital mydriasis but no neurological deficit up to age 41. Magnetic resonance angiogram demonstrated cerebrovascular lesions resembling but distinct from Moyamoya disease, characterised by internal carotid artery dilatation, terminal segment stenosis and absent basal collaterals. Their mother had poorly reactive pupils with asymptomatic cerebral arteriopathy resembling her daughters. All three had prominent retinal arteriolar tortuosity. The daughters were heterozygous and the mother was a somatic mosaic for a novel c.351C &gt; G (p.Asn117Lys) transversion in ACTA2. Iris optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a hyporeflective band anterior to the pigment epithelium indicating the presence of dysfunctional sphincter muscle. Adaptive optics retinal imaging showed no thickening of the arteriolar vessel wall whilst OCT angiography showed extreme corkscrew course of arterioles suggesting vessel elongation.In addition to the known association between Met46, Arg179 and Arg258 substitutions and ACTA2-related arteriopathy, this case illustrates the possibility that Asn117 also plays an important role in α-SMA function within the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cell. MSMDS-related congenital mydriasis is due to reduced iris sphincter contractility rather than its absence. Retinal arteriolar tortuosity might be due to longitudinal proliferation of arteriolar smooth muscle cells. The described cerebrovascular and ocular signs are consistent with predicted effects of the novel Asn117Lys substitution in ACTA2."	"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of fatty liver disease that is defined by the presence of inflammation and fibrosis, which ultimately leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We previously showed that human placental extract (hPE) was intramuscularly injected to ameliorates liver injury in a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH model. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hPE using dB/dB mice which exhibit obesity and insulin resistance and are thought to reproduce the pathological background of NASH. The MCD-diet induced liver atrophy accompanied by fibrosis around the liver sinusoids. hPE dose-dependently reduced the perivascular fibrosis. Moreover, αSMA-positive activated hepatic stellate cells increased in number in mice on the MCD diet, with this effect reversed by hPE treatment. hPE significantly decreased expression of Acta2, Col1a1, and Tgfb1 genes in hepatic stellate cells, and inhibited Smad phosphorylation. Moreover, hPE treatment increased the expression of the anti-oxidative genes Hmox1, Nqo1, Cat, and Sod1, and significantly enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 activity. Furthermore, hPE decreased the expression of Nox4 and attenuated the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results, along with our previous study, suggest that hPE effectively ameliorates liver fibrosis in NASH. This beneficial effect may, in part, be due to suppression of hepatic stellate cell activation."	"Astaxanthin (ASTX) has been reported as a potential therapeutic agent for hepatic fibrosis treatment. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to low bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility. In this study, biopolymer-based nanoparticles were fabricated using stearic acid-chitosan conjugate (SA-CS) and sodium caseinate (NaCas) via ionic gelation. Its nanostructure was cross-linked using oxidized dextran (Odex) via Schiff base reaction. Concentration of cross-linker, cross-linking temperature and time were systematically optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) to achieve superior particulate properties and colloidal stability. The optimized nanoparticles exhibited a diameter of 120 nm with homogeneous size distribution. A good ASTX encapsulation capacity with up to 6% loading ratio and high encapsulation efficiency was obtained. The final ASTX concentration in nanoparticles was 140 μM. The aqueous dispersibility of encapsulated ASTX was greatly improved, which was confirmed by significantly increased ABTS radical scavenging capacity. Compared to the anti-fibrogenic effect of free ASTX in LX-2 cells, the encapsulated ASTX demonstrated dramatically enhanced cellular bioactivity, as evidenced by significantly lower TGFβ1-induced fibrogenic gene (ACTA2 and COL1A1) expression level, as well as α-SMA and COL1A1 protein levels. This study suggests that the as-prepared biopolymer nanoparticles hold promising features as an oral delivery vehicle for lipophilic bioactives."	"A variant in the <i>PRDM16</i> locus has been correlated with QRS duration in an electrocardiogram genome-wide association study, and the deletion of <i>PRDM16</i> has been implicated as a causal factor of the dilated cardiomyopathy that is linked to 1p36 deletion syndrome. We aimed to determine how a null mutation of <i>Prdm16</i> affects cardiac function and study the underlying mechanism of the resulting phenotype in an appropriate mouse model. We used cardiac-specific <i>Prdm16</i> conditional knockout mice to examine cardiac function by electrocardiography. QRS duration and QTc interval increased significantly in cardiac-specific <i>Prdm16</i> knockout animals compared with wild-type mice. Further, we assessed cardiomyopathy-associated features by trichrome staining, densitometry, and hydroxyproline assay. <i>Prdm16</i>-null hearts showed greater fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. By quantitative real-time PCR, <i>Prdm16</i>-null hearts upregulated extracellular matrix-related genes (<i>Ctgf</i>, <i>Timp1</i>) and α-smooth muscle actin (<i>Acta2</i>), a myofibroblast marker. Moreover, TGF-β signaling was activated in <i>Prdm16</i>-null hearts, as evidenced by increased <i>Tgfb1-3</i> transcript levels and phosphorylated Smad2. However, the inhibition of TGF-β receptor did not reverse the aberrations in conduction in cardiac-specific <i>Prdm16</i> knockout mice. To determine the underlying mechanisms, we performed RNA-seq using mouse left ventricular tissue. By functional analysis, <i>Prdm16</i>-null hearts experienced dysregulated expression of ion channel genes, including <i>Kcne1</i>, <i>Scn5a</i>, <i>Cacna1h</i>, and <i>Cacna2d2</i>. Mice with <i>Prdm16</i>-null hearts develop abnormalities in cardiac conduction and cardiomyopathy-associated phenotypes, including fibrosis and cellular hypertrophy. Further, the RNA-seq findings suggest that impairments in ion homeostasis (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Na<sup>+</sup>) may at least partially underlie the abnormal conduction in cardiac-specific <i>Prdm16</i> knockout mice.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> This is the first study that describes aberrant cardiac function and cardiomyopathy-associated phenotypes in an appropriate murine genetic model with cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Prdm16</i>-null mutation. It is noteworthy that the correlation of <i>PRDM16</i> with QRS duration is replicated in a murine animal model and the potential underlying mechanism may be the impairment of ion homeostasis."	"The MYH11 gene codes for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, which has a critical function in maintaining vascular wall stability. Patients with this mutation most commonly have aortic and cardiac defects. Documented involvement of intracranial vessels is exceptional.A 29-year-old woman with a history of patent ductus arteriosus and aortic dissection was found to have incidental bilateral stenosis of the terminal internal carotid arteries as well as the proximal anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, and posterior cerebral arteries on magnetic resonance angiography that was obtained for unrelated symptoms. There was no evidence of basal collateral formation, and a generalized straightening of the vessels was observed. These angiographic findings have been typically observed in patients with ACTA2 mutations. Thus, genetic testing was pursued, which uncovered the presence of an MYH11 mutation. Follow-up imaging at 51 months demonstrated that the intracranial stenosis remained stable without evidence of basal collateral formation. She did not experience any neurologic events during the follow-up interval.Intracranial vessel involvement in patients with MYH11 mutations is rare. Vigilant cerebrovascular monitoring should be practiced in this population to guide appropriate management. Reporting of similar cases is important to improve understanding of the development of idiopathic intracranial stenosis in young individuals."	"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Kinesin family member 3A (KIF3A) on primary cilia and myofibroblast differentiation during silicosis by regulating Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling. <b>Methods</b>: Changes in primary cilia during silicosis and myofibroblast differentiation were detected in silicotic patients, experimental silicotic rats, and a myofibroblast differentiation model induced by SiO<sub>2</sub>. We also explored the mechanisms underlying KIF3A regulation of Glioma-associated oncogene homologs (GLIs) involved in myofibroblast differentiation. <b>Results</b>: Primary cilia (marked by ARL13B and Ac-α-Tub) and ciliary-related proteins (IFT 88 and KIF3A) were increased initially and then decreased as silicosis progressed. Loss and shedding of primary cilia were also found during silicosis. Treatment of MRC-5 fibroblasts with silica and then transfection of <i>KIF3A</i>-siRNA blocked activation of SHH signalling, but increased GLI2<sup>FL</sup> as a transcriptional activator of <i>SRF</i>, and reduced the inhibitory effect of GLI3<sup>R</sup> on <i>ACTA2</i>. <b>Conclusion</b>: Our findings indicate that primary cilia are markedly altered during silicosis and the loss of KIF3A may promote myofibroblast differentiation induced by SiO<sub>2</sub>."	"Although cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are crucial stromal cells, characterizing their heterogeneity is far from complete. This study reports a novel subset of CAFs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which positively expressed CD68, the classic marker of macrophages. The spatial and temporal distribution of the CD68<sup>+</sup> CAF subset of OSCC (n = 104) was determined by CD68/actin alpha 2, smooth muscle (ACTA2+; α-SMA) immunohistochemistry of serial sections. The CD68<sup>+</sup> α-SMA<sup>+</sup> CAF subset was elevated from dysplasia to OSCC. Moreover, although both the tumor center and invasive front harbor an abundant CD68<sup>+</sup> CAF subset, patients with low-CD68<sup>+</sup> CAFs in the tumor center showed more recurrence after operation and shorter survival time, indicating the different function of CD68<sup>+</sup> CAFs in tumor initiation and progression. Functional analysis in the OSCC-CAF co-culture system found knockdown of CD68 did not change the phenotype of CAFs, tumor growth, or migration. Unexpectedly, low-CD68<sup>+</sup> CAFs were associated with aberrant immune balance. A high proportion of tumor-supportive Tregs was found in patients with low-CD68<sup>+</sup> CAFs. Mechanistically, knockdown of CD68 in CAFs contributed to the up-regulation of chemokine CCL17 and CCL22 of tumor cells to enhance Treg recruitment. Thus, up-regulated CD68<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts participate in tumor initiation, but the low-CD68<sup>+</sup> CAF subset in OSCC is conducive to regulatory T-cell (Treg) recruitment in the tumor microenvironment and contribute to poor prognosis of OSCC patients."	"Pharmacological treatments for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are still unsatisfactory. Fibrosis is the most significant predictor of mortality and many anti-fibrotic agents are under evaluation. Herein, we assessed in vitro the effects of the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) and the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 in a well-established co-culture NASH model. Co-cultures of human hepatoma and hepatic stellate (HSCs) cells were exposed to free fatty acids (FFAs) alone or in combination with OCA or INT-767. mRNA expression of HSCs activation markers and FXR engagement were evaluated at 24, 96 and 144 hours. Collagen deposition and metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2-9) activity were compared to tropifexor and selonsertib. FFAs induced collagen deposition and MMP2-9 activity reduction. Co-treatment with OCA or INT-767 did not affect ACTA2 and COL1A1 expression, but significantly reduced FXR and induced SHP expression, as expected. OCA induced a dose-dependent reduction of collagen and induced MMP2-9 activity. Similarly, INT-767 induced collagen reduction at 96 h and a slight increase in MMP2-9. Tropifexor and Selonsertib were also effective in collagen reduction but showed no modulation of MMP2-9. All tested compounds reduced collagen deposition. OCA exerted a more potent and long-lasting effect, mainly related to modulation of collagen turn-over and MMP2-9 activity."	NA
"COL3A1"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic interstitial lung disease with lesions confined to the lungs. To identify meaningful microRNA (miRNA) and gene modules related to the IPF progression, GSE32537 (RNA-sequencing data) and GSE32538 (miRNA-sequencing data) were downloaded and processed, and then weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct gene co-expression networks and miRNA co-expression networks. GSE10667, GSE70866, and GSE27430 were used to make a reasonable validation for the results and evaluate the clinical significance of the genes and the miRNAs. Six hub genes (COL3A1, COL1A2, OGN, COL15A1, ASPN, and MXRA5) and seven hub miRNAs (hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-29c-3p, hsa-let-7c-5p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p) were clarified and validated. Meanwhile, iteration network of hub miRNAs-hub genes was constructed, and the emerging role of the network being involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was also analyzed by several webtools. The expression levels of hub genes were different between normal lung tissues and NSCLC tissues. Six genes (COL3A1, COL1A2, OGN, COL15A1, ASPN, and MXRA5) and three miRNAs (hsa-miR-29c-3p, hsa-let-7c-5p, and hsa-miR-29b-3p) were related to the survival time of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The interaction network of hub miRNAs-hub genes might provide common mechanisms involving in IPF and NSCLC. More importantly, useful clues were provided for clinical treatment of both diseases based on novel molecular advances."	"Although knee immobilization may deteriorate the mechanical parameters of the anterior cruciate ligament, such as stiffness and failure strength, it is unknown whether it induces laxity in the whole joint. We examined the effects of immobilization on anterior-posterior joint laxity and mechanical properties of the anterior cruciate ligament, as well as histological and gene expression profiles of the joint capsule in rat knee joints.Unilateral rat knees were immobilized using an external fixator. Non-immobilized contralateral knees were used as controls. After 3 weeks, anterior-posterior laxity in the whole joint (i.e., a complex of bones, ligaments, and capsule) and stiffness and failure strength in the anterior cruciate ligament were examined using a universal testing machine. Moreover, the knee joint capsule was histologically analyzed, and the expression levels of genes related to collagen turnover in the posterior joint capsule were examined.Joint immobilization slightly but significantly increased anterior-posterior laxity compared with the contralateral side. Unexpectedly, the stiffness and failure strength of the anterior cruciate ligament were not altered by immobilization. There was no correlation found between anterior cruciate ligament stiffness and anterior-posterior joint laxity. In the posterior joint capsule, thinning of the collagen fiber bundles accompanied by a decrease in COL3A1 gene expression was observed after immobilization.These results suggest that 3 weeks of joint immobilization alters the biomechanical integrity in the knee joint without altering the mechanical properties of the anterior cruciate ligament. Changes in the joint capsule may contribute to the immobilization-induced increase in anterior-posterior laxity."	"The first immunosuppressive drug - cyclosporine A (CsA) has many unquestioned merits in maintaining organ transplants in patients, as well as, in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases, associated also with cutaneous manifestations. The main task of this drug is to suppress the inflammatory response at the sites of action, which is not well known.The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of CsA in therapeutic concentration on the expression of genes associated with the inflammatory response pathway in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF; CC-2511) and this study attempted to determine the mechanism of its action.The cytotoxicity MTT test was performed. The expression of the inflammatory response pathway genes was determined using HG-U133A_2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays. Statistical analysis was performed by GeneSpring 13.0 software using the PL-Grid platform.Among the 5,300 mRNA only 573 were changed significantly in response to CsA compared to the control fibroblasts (P≤0.05). CsA inhibited the expression of most genes associated with inflammatory response in NHDFs. There were only 19 genes with a fold change (FC) lower than -2.0, among which EGR1, FOS, PBK, CDK1 and TOP2A had the lowest expression, as did CXCL2 which can directly impact inflammation. Furthermore, ZNF451 was strongly induced, and COL1A1, COL3A1, IL33, TNFRSFs were weakly upregulated (FC lower than 2.0).The CsA in therapeutic concentration influence the genes linked to inflammatory response (in the transcriptional level) in human dermal fibroblasts. The findings suggest that the potential mechanism of CsA action in this concentration and on these genes can be associated with a profibrotic and proapoptotic, and genotoxic effects."	"Ovarian cancer rates the highest mortality among all gynecological malignancies. The main reason for high mortality is the development of drug resistance. It can be related to increased expression of drug transporters and increased expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Our foremost aim was to exhibit alterations in the miRNA expression levels in cisplatin (CIS), paclitaxel (PAC), doxorubicin (DOX), and topotecan (TOP)-resistant variants of the W1 sensitive ovarian cancer cell line-using miRNA microarray. The second goal was to identify miRNAs responsible for the regulation of drug-resistant genes. According to our observation, alterations in the expression of 40 miRNAs were present. We could observe that, in at least one drug-resistant cell line, the expression of 21 miRNAs was upregulated and that of 19 miRNAs was downregulated. We identified target genes for 22 miRNAs. Target analysis showed that miRNA regulates key genes responsible for drug resistance. Among others, we observed regulation of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 gene (<i>ABCB1</i>) in the paclitaxel-resistant cell line by miR-363 and regulation of the collagen type III alpha 1 chain gene (<i>COL3A1</i>) in the topotekan-resistant cell line by miR-29a."	"The mechanisms underlying the formation of intestinal fibrostrictures (FS) in Crohn's disease (CD) are not fully understood, but activation of fibroblasts and excessive collagen deposition are supposed to contribute to the development of FS. Here we investigated whether interleukine-34 (IL-34), that is over-produced in CD, regulates collagen production by gut fibroblasts.IL-34 and its receptor macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor 1 (M-CSFR-1) were evaluated in inflammatory (I), FS CD, and control (CTR) ileal mucosal samples by real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.IL-34 and M-CSFR-1 expression was evaluated in normal and FS CD fibroblasts. Control fibroblasts were stimulated with IL-34 in the presence or absence of a MAP kinase p38 inhibitor while FS CD fibroblasts were cultured with a specific IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide and collagen production was evaluated by real time, western blotting and Sircol assay. The effect of IL-34 on the wound-healing capacity of fibroblasts was evaluated by scratch test.We showed enhanced M-CSFR-1 and IL-34 RNA and protein expression in FS CD mucosal samples as compared to ICD and CTR samples. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that stromal cells were positive for M-CSFR-1 and IL-34. Enhanced M-CSFR-1 and IL-34 RNA and protein expression was seen in FS CD fibroblasts as compared to CTR. Stimulation of control fibroblasts with IL-34 enhanced COL1A1 and COL3A1 expression, secretion of collagen through a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism and wound healing. IL-34 knockdown in FS CD fibroblasts associated with reduced collagen production and wound repair.Data indicate a prominent role of IL-34 in the control of intestinal fibrogenesis."	"Single-cell transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of the cell composition of tumors and allowed us to identify new subtypes of cells. Despite rapid technological advancements, single-cell analysis remains resource-intense hampering the scalability that is required to profile a sufficient number of samples for clinical associations. Therefore, more scalable approaches are needed to understand the contribution of individual cell types to the development and treatment response of solid tumors such as esophageal adenocarcinoma where comprehensive genomic studies have only led to a small number of targeted therapies. Due to the limited treatment options and late diagnosis, esophageal adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis. Understanding the interaction between and dysfunction of individual cell populations provides an opportunity for the development of new interventions. In an attempt to address the technological and clinical needs, we developed a protocol for the separation of esophageal carcinoma tissue into leukocytes (CD45+), epithelial cells (EpCAM+), and fibroblasts (two out of PDGFRα, CD90, anti-fibroblast) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing. We confirm successful separation of the three cell populations by mapping their transcriptomic profiles to reference cell lineage expression data. Gene-level analysis further supports the isolation of individual cell populations with high expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD20 for leukocytes, CDH1 and MUC1 for epithelial cells, and FAP, SMA, COL1A1, and COL3A1 for fibroblasts. As a proof of concept, we profiled tumor samples of nine patients and explored expression differences in the three cell populations between tumor and normal tissue. Interestingly, we found that angiogenesis-related genes were upregulated in fibroblasts isolated from tumors compared with normal tissue. Overall, we suggest our protocol as a complementary and more scalable approach compared with single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate associations between clinical parameters and transcriptomic alterations of specific cell populations in esophageal adenocarcinoma."	"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease with a multifactorial etiology. The genetic component is one of the main associated factors, resulting from interactions between genes and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to identify gene-gene interactions (epistasis) of the articular cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) in knee OA. Ninety-two knee OA patients and 147 healthy individuals were included. Participants were genotyped in order to evaluate nine variants of eight genes associated with ECM metabolism using the OpenArray technology. Epistasis was analyzed using the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. The MDR analysis showed significant gene-gene interactions between MMP3 (rs679620) and COL3A1 (rs1800255), and between COL3A1 (rs1800255) and VEGFA (rs699947) polymorphisms, with information gain values of 3.21% and 2.34%, respectively. Furthermore, in our study we found interactions in high-risk genotypes of the HIF1AN, MMP3 and COL3A1 genes; the most representative were [AA+CC+GA], [AA+CT+GA] and [AA+CT+GG], respectively; and low-risk genotypes [AA+CC+GG], [GG+TT+GA] and [AA+TT+GA], respectively. Knowing the interactions of these polymorphisms involved in articular cartilage ECM metabolism could provide a new tool to identify individuals at high risk of developing knee OA."	"Pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax are presented in most patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome, which is caused by loss of function mutations in the <i>folliculin</i> (<i>FLCN</i>) gene. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the cystic lung disease in BHD are poorly understood.Mesenchymal <i>Flcn</i> was specifically deleted in mice or in cultured lung mesenchymal progenitor cells using a Cre/loxP approach. Dynamic changes in lung structure, cellular and molecular phenotypes and signalling were measured by histology, immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting.Deletion of <i>Flcn</i> in mesoderm-derived mesenchymal cells results in significant reduction of postnatal alveolar growth and subsequent alveolar destruction, leading to cystic lesions. Cell proliferation and alveolar myofibroblast differentiation are inhibited in the <i>Flcn</i> knockout lungs, and expression of the extracellular matrix proteins Col3a1 and elastin are downregulated. Signalling pathways including mTORC1, AMP-activated protein kinase, ERK1/2 and Wnt-β-catenin are differentially affected at different developmental stages. All the above changes have statistical significance (p&lt;0.05).Mesenchymal Flcn is an essential regulator during alveolar development and maintenance, through multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. The mesenchymal <i>Flcn</i> knockout mouse model provides the first in vivo disease model that may recapitulate the stages of cyst development in human BHD. These findings elucidate the developmental origins and mechanisms of lung disease in BHD."	"To evaluate aortic disease progression and reintervention after an initial thoracic aortic dissection in pathogenic variant carriers.Of 175 participants diagnosed with thoracic aortic dissection, 31 had a pathogenic variant (pathogenic group) across 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFBR2) identified by whole exome sequencing. Those with benign or normal variants (benign/normal group, n = 144) comprised the control group. Clinical data were collected through medical record review (1985-2018) and supplemented with the National Death Index database (December 2018).The entire cohort (n = 175) consisted of 108 type A aortic dissections and 67 type B aortic dissections, similarly distributed between groups. The pathogenic group was significantly younger (43 vs 56 years, P &lt; .0001) and had significantly more aortic root replacements and similar extents of arch replacement at initial type A aortic dissection repair. The median follow-up time was 7.5 (4.6-12) years. After initial treatment, the pathogenic group required significantly more aortic reinterventions (median 1 vs 0, P &lt; .0001) and mean cumulative aortic reinterventions for each patient (10 years: 1 vs 0.5, P = .029). Both incidence rate (12%/year vs 1.2%/year, P = .0001) and cumulative incidence of reinterventions (9 years: 70% vs 6%, P &lt; .0001) for the preserved native aortic root were significantly higher in the pathogenic group, but were similar for the preserved native aortic arch and distal aorta between groups. Ten-year survival was similar in the pathogenic and benign/normal groups (92% vs 85%).Aggressive aortic root replacement and similar arch management should be considered in pathogenic variant carriers at initial type A aortic dissection repair compared with benign/normal variant carriers."	"<b>Background:</b> Systemic sclerosis (SSc) T cells can induce apoptosis of autologous skin fibroblasts <i>in vitro</i>. Th17 cells have been reported to increase in SSc patients, and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has a profibrotic function. We used a system based on T-cell-autologous fibroblast co-cultures to further investigate a possible role of IL-17A in SSc. <b>Methods:</b> T cells from diffuse SSc patients were co-cultured with autologous skin fibroblasts. <i>IL17A</i> mRNA was assessed by real-time PCR in co-cultured and control T cells, while <i>IL17RA, CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3, COL1A1, COL3A1, CTGF, TGFBR2</i>, and <i>SMAD3</i> mRNAs were assessed in co-cultured and control fibroblasts. In subset experiments, co-cultures and control cells were treated with either IL-17A or IL-17A <i>plus</i> anti-IL17 receptor monoclonal antibody (α-IL-17RA mAb). Chemokine and procollagen type I (PCI) production was further investigated at the protein level in cell culture supernatants by multiple suspension immunoassay and sandwich ELISA, respectively. Co-cultured and control fibroblasts were also stained with Annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry. <b>Results:</b> T cell-fibroblast co-cultures overexpressed <i>IL17A</i> and <i>IL17RA</i>. Furthermore, co-cultured fibroblasts upregulated IL-17A targets <i>CXCL1, CCL2</i>, and <i>CCL3</i>, while <i>COL1A1, COL3A1, CTGF</i>, and two key effectors of the TGF-β signaling, <i>TGFBR2</i> and <i>SMAD3</i>, were found downregulated. Consistently, chemokine concentrations were increased in co-culture supernatants, while PCI levels were reduced, especially after stimulation with ectopic IL-17A. Finally, simultaneous α-IL-17RA mAb treatment restored PCI levels and reduced fibroblast apoptosis in IL-17A-stimulated co-cultures. <b>Conclusion:</b> These data suggest that IL-17A upregulation might play a role in modulating T cell-mediated antifibrotic and proapoptotic effects in co-cultured autologous skin fibroblasts."	"Reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis. Herein, we investigated the effects of l-Arginine, the main precursor of NO, on the osteogenic differentiation of aortic interstitial valve cells (VICs).We isolated a clonal population of bovine VICs that expresses osteogenic markers and induces calcification of collagen matrix after stimulation with endotoxin (LPS 500 ng/mL). VICs were treated in vitro with different combinations of LPS ± l-Arginine (50 or 100 mM) and cell extracts were collected to perform proteomic (iTRAQ) and gene expression (RT-PCR) analysis.l-Arginine prevents the over-expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP, p &lt; 0.001) and reduces matrix calcification (p &lt; 0.05) in VICs treated with LPS. l-Arginine also reduces the over-expression of inflammatory molecules induced by LPS (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta, p &lt; 0.001). The proteomic analysis allowed to identify 49 proteins with an altered expression profile after stimulation with LPS and significantly modified by l-Arginine. These include proteins involved in the redox homeostasis of the cells (i.e. Xanthine Oxidase, Catalase, Aldehyde Oxidase), remodeling of the extracellular matrix (i.e. ADAMTSL4, Basigin, COL3A1) and cellular signaling (i.e. Fibrillin-1, Legumain, S100A13). The RT-PCR analysis confirmed the modifications of Fibrillin-1, ADAMTSL4, Basigin and Xanthine Oxidase, whose expression levels increase after stimulation with LPS and are reduced by l-Arginine (p &lt; 0.05).l-Arginine prevents osteogenic differentiation of VICs and reduces matrix calcification. This effect is achieved through the modulation of proteins involved in the cellular redox system, remodeling of extracellular matrix and inflammatory activation of VICs."	"Primary open-angle glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, often associated with increased intraocular pressure. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry a specific composition of proteins, lipids and nucleotides have been considered as essential mediators of cell-cell communication. Their potential impact for crosstalk between tissues responsible for aqueous humour production and out-flow is largely unknown. The study objective was to investigate the effects of EVs derived from non-pigmented ciliary epithelium (NPCE) primary cells on the expression of Wnt proteins in a human primary trabecular meshwork (TM) cells and define the mechanism underlying exosome-mediated regulation that signalling pathway. Consistent with the results in TM cell line, EVs released by both primary NPCE cells and NPCE cell line showed diminished pGSK3β phosphorylation and decreased cytosolic levels of β-catenin in primary TM cells. At the molecular level, we showed that NPCE exosome treatment downregulated the expression of positive GSKβ regulator-AKT protein but increased the levels of GSKβ negative regulator-PP2A protein in TM cells. NPCE exosome protein analysis revealed 584 miRNAs and 182 proteins involved in the regulation of TM cellular processes, including WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix deposition. We found that negative modulator of Wnt signalling miR-29b was abundant in NPCE exosomal samples and treatment of TM cells with NPCE EVs significantly decreased COL3A1 expression. Suggesting that miR-29b can be responsible for decreased levels of WNT/β-catenin pathway. Overall, this study highlights a potential role of EVs derived from NPCE cells in modulating ECM proteins and TM canonical Wnt signalling."	"The role of IL-6 signalling in hypertensive heart disease and its sequelae is controversial. Our group demonstrated that Bazedoxifene suppressed IL-6/gp130 signalling in cancer cells but its effect on myocardial pathology induced by pressure overload is still unknown. We explored whether Bazedoxifene could confer benefits in wild-type C57BL/6J mice suffering from transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and the potential mechanisms in H9c2 myoblasts. Mice were randomized into three groups (Sham, TAC, TAC+Bazedoxifene, n = 10). Morphological and histological observations suggested TAC aggravated myocardial remodelling while long-term intake of Bazedoxifene (5 mg/kg, intragastric) attenuated pressure overload-induced pathology. Echocardiographic results indicated Bazedoxifene rescued cardiac function in part. We found Bazedoxifene decreased the mRNA expression of IL-6, MMP2, Col1A1, Col3A1 and periostin in murine hearts after 8-week surgery. By Western blot detection, we found Bazedoxifene exhibited an inhibition of STAT3 activation in mice three hours and 8 weeks after TAC. Acute TAC stress (3 hours) led to down-regulated ratio of LC3-Ⅱ/LC3-Ⅰ, while in mice after long-term (8 weeks) TAC this ratio becomes higher than that in Sham mice. Bazedoxifene inverted the autophagic alteration induced by TAC at both two time-points. In H9c2 myoblasts, Bazedoxifene suppressed the IL-6-induced STAT3 activation. Moreover, IL-6 reduced the ratio of LC3-Ⅱ/LC3-Ⅰ, promoted P62 expression but Bazedoxifene reversed both changes in H9c2 cells. Our data suggested Bazedoxifene inhibited IL-6/gp130 signalling and protected against cardiac remodelling together with function deterioration in TAC mice."	"<b>Rationale:</b> The PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) is expressed in vascular smooth muscle (VSM), and increased VSM PTH1R signaling mitigates diet-induced arteriosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice. <b>Objective:</b> To study the impact of VSM PTH1R deficiency, we generated mice SM22-Cre:PTH1R(fl/fl);LDLR-/- mice (PTH1R-VKO) and Cre-negative controls (CON). <b>Methods and Results:</b> Immunofluorescence and western blot confirmed PTH1R expression in arterial VSM that was reduced by Cre-mediated knockout. PTH1R-VKO cohorts exhibited increased aortic collagen accumulation in vivo, and VSM cultures from PTH1R-VKO mice elaborated more collagen (2.5-fold; p = 0.01) with elevated Col3a1 and Col1a1 expression. To better understand these profibrotic responses, we performed mass spectrometry on nuclear proteins extracted from CON and PTH1R-VKO VSM. PTH1R deficiency reduced Gata6 but upregulated the MADS-box transcriptional co-regulator, myocardin-related transcription factor A (Mkl1). Co-transfection assays (Col3a1 promoter - luciferase reporter) confirmed PTH1R -mediated inhibition and Mkl1-mediated activation of Col3a1 transcription. Regulation mapped to a conserved hybrid CT(A/T)6GG MADS-box cognate in the Col3a1 promoter. Mutations of C/G's in this motif markedly reduced Col3a1 transcriptional regulation by PTH1R and Mkl1. Upregulation of Col3a1 and Col1a1 in PTH1R-VKO VSM was inhibited by siRNA targeting Mkl1, and by treatment with the Mkl1 antagonist CCG1423 or the Rock2 inhibitor KD025. Chromatin precipitation demonstrated that VSM PTH1R deficiency increased Mkl1 binding to Col3a1 and Col1a1, but not TNF, promoters. Proteomic studies of plasma extracellular vesicles (EV) and VSM from PTH1R-VKO mice identified C1r and C1s, complement proteins involved in vascular collagen metabolism, as potential biomarkers. VSM C1r protein and C1r message were increased with PTH1R deficiency, mediated by Mkl1-dependent transcription and inhibited by CCG1423 or KD025. <b>Conclusions:</b> PTH1R signaling restricts collagen production in the VSM lineage in part via Mkl1 regulatory circuits that control collagen gene transcription. Strategies that maintain homeostatic VSM PTH1R signaling, as reflected in EV biomarkers of VSM PTH1R/Mkl1 action, may help mitigate arteriosclerosis and vascular fibrosis."	"The dense formation of abnormal scar tissue after total knee arthroplasty results in arthrofibrosis, an unfortunate sequela of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to use a validated rabbit model to assess the effects on surgically-induced knee joint contractures of two combined pharmacological interventions: celecoxib (CXB) loaded on an implanted collagen membrane, and subcutaneously (SQ) injected ketotifen. Thirty rabbits were randomly divided into five groups. The first group received no intervention after the index surgery. The remaining four groups underwent intra-articular implantation of collagen membranes loaded with or without CXB at the time of the index surgery; two of which were also treated with SQ ketotifen. Biomechanical joint contracture data were collected at 8, 10, 16, and 24 weeks. At the time of necropsy (24 weeks), posterior capsule tissue was collected for messenger RNA and histopathologic analyses. At 24 weeks, there was a statistically significant increase in passive extension among rabbits in all groups treated with CXB and/or ketotifen compared to those in the contracture control group. There was a statistically significant decrease in COL3A1, COL6A1, and ACTA2 gene expression in the treatment groups compared to the contracture control group (P &lt; .001). Histopathologic data also demonstrated a trend towards decreased fibrous tissue density in the CXB membrane group compared to the vehicle membrane group. The present data suggest that intra-articular placement of a treated collagen membrane blunts the severity of contracture development in a rabbit model of arthrofibrosis, and that ketotifen and CXB may independently contribute to the prevention of arthrofibrosis. Statement of clinical significance: Current literature has demonstrated that arthrofibrosis may affect up to 5% of primary total knee arthroplasty patients. For that reason, novel pharmacologic prophylaxis and treatment modalities are critical to mitigating reoperations and revisions while improving the quality of life for patients with this debilitating condition."	"Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a rare, syndromic, heritable condition with life-threatening complications that include aortic and arterial aneurysms, dissection, and rupture. This study describes the formation of the vEDS Research Collaborative and methods used for stakeholder engagement.The vEDS Research Collaborative was established with an engagement award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to create a framework for a patient-researcher partnership. Between October 1, 2017, and September 30, 2018, the Collaborative used the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Engagement Rubric to conduct stakeholder engagement to develop a patient-centered research agenda. A modified Delphi technique was used to develop and to refine research topics and questions, gathering input from all stakeholders during three rounds of feedback.Four topic areas were deemed important: mental health and quality of life issues, creating a care team, a holistic approach to vEDS management (medical and surgical), and pregnancy management. An online survey to rank a list of 12 research questions in these topic areas in order of importance was disseminated. The questions were ranked in order of importance through an online survey (N = 197 responses). The survey showed a high degree of alignment in the top priorities among stakeholders. There was a high degree of interest in pragmatic clinical trials evaluating medical management options and health-related quality of life outcomes.The vEDS Research Collaborative has built a sustainable, coalition model of patient and stakeholder engagement, supported by the vEDS community, to identify a patient-centered, prioritized list of research questions. In articulating a shared vision for the future of vEDS research, the Collaborative has laid the groundwork for developing research protocols aligned with the highest priority questions for the individuals affected by this serious condition that can be translated into future clinical trials."	"A subset of patients receiving radiation therapy for pelvic cancer develop radiation cystitis, a complication characterized by mucosal cell death, inflammation, hematuria, and bladder fibrosis. Radiation cystitis can reduce bladder capacity, cause incontinence, and impair voiding function so severely that patients require surgical intervention. Factors influencing onset and severity of radiation cystitis are not fully known. We tested the hypothesis that genetic background is a contributing factor. We irradiated bladders of female C57BL/6, C3H, and BALB/c mice and evaluated urinary voiding function, bladder shape, histology, collagen composition, and distribution of collagen-producing cells. We found that the genetic background profoundly affects the severity of radiation-induced bladder fibrosis and urinary voiding dysfunction. C57BL/6 mice are most susceptible and C3H mice are most resistant. Irradiated C57BL/6 mouse bladders are misshapen and express more abundant collagen I and III proteins than irradiated C3H and BALB/c bladders. We localized Col1a1 and Col3a1 mRNAs to FSP1-negative stromal cells in the bladder lamina propria and detrusor. The number of collagen I and collagen III-producing cells can predict the average voided volume of a mouse. Collectively, we show that genetic factors confer sensitivity to radiation cystitis, establish C57BL/6 mice as a sensitive preclinical model, and identify a potential role for FSP1-negative stromal cells in radiation-induced bladder fibrosis."	"Background and Purpose- Mendelian stroke confers a high lifetime risk for mutation carriers; however, ethnicity-specific prevalence estimates have been difficult to establish. Methods- Eighteen genes responsible for Mendelian stroke were investigated using the Genome Aggregation Database. Genome Aggregation Database participants belonged to 1 of 7 populations: African/African-American, Latino/Admixed American, Ashkenazi Jewish, East Asian, Finnish European, non-Finnish European, and South Asian. Rare nonsynonymous variants from 101 635 participants free of neurological disease were examined for each ethnicity. Mutations were categorized according to 3 nested classes: pathogenic clinical variants, likely damaging variants based on in silico prediction, and all nonsynonymous variants. Results- <i>ABCC6</i>, <i>KRIT1</i>, <i>CECR1</i>, <i>COL3A1</i>, <i>COL4A1</i>, <i>COL4A2</i>, <i>COLGALT1</i>, <i>GLA</i>, <i>HTRA1</i>, <i>NOTCH3</i>, <i>RNF213</i>, and <i>TREX1</i> harbored pathogenic clinical variants in Genome Aggregation Database. Across all 18 genes, total nonsynonymous carrier frequency was found to be high in 5 ethnicities (African/African-American, Latino/Admixed American, East Asian, non-Finnish European, and South Asian; 28.5%-37.5%) while lower total frequencies were estimated for in silico-predicted likely damaging variants (14.9%-19.7%) and pathogenic clinical variants (0.7%-2.8%). Overall, East Asian exhibited the highest total pathogenic clinical mutation carrier frequency (2.8%). <i>ABCC6</i> pathogenic clinical variants were most prevalent among East Asian (0.8%). Pathogenic <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, causal for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, were most frequent among East Asian (1.1%) and South Asian (1.2%). East Asian also demonstrated the highest carrier rate for <i>RNF213</i> (0.8%). Finnish European exhibited the greatest <i>HTRA1</i> frequency (0.2%), while <i>COL4A1</i> pathogenic variants were most prevalent in African/African-American (0.3%). Conclusions- Especially, among pathogenic clinical variants, Mendelian stroke genetic prevalence differed significantly between populations. These prevalence estimates may serve as guides for screening and risk profiling in patients worldwide, particularly for understudied non-European populations."	"Despite increasing understanding of the prognostic importance of vascular stiffening linked to perivascular fibrosis in hypertension, the molecular and cellular regulation of this process is poorly understood.To study the functional role of microRNA-214 (miR-214) in the induction of perivascular fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction driving vascular stiffening.Out of 381 miRs screened in the perivascular tissues in response to Ang II (angiotensin II)-mediated hypertension, miR-214 showed the highest induction (8-fold, <i>P</i>=0.0001). MiR-214 induction was pronounced in perivascular and circulating T cells, but not in perivascular adipose tissue adipocytes. Global deletion of miR-214<sup>-</sup><sup>/-</sup> prevented Ang II-induced periaortic fibrosis, <i>Col1a1</i>, <i>Col3a1, Col5a1</i>, and <i>Tgfb1</i> expression, hydroxyproline accumulation, and vascular stiffening, without difference in blood pressure. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-214<sup>-/-</sup> mice were protected against endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and increased Nox2, all of which were induced by Ang II in WT mice. Ang II-induced recruitment of T cells into perivascular adipose tissue was abolished in miR-214<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Adoptive transfer of miR-214<sup>-/-</sup> T cells into RAG1<sup>-/-</sup> mice resulted in reduced perivascular fibrosis compared with the effect of WT T cells. Ang II induced hypertension caused significant change in the expression of 1380 T cell genes in WT, but only 51 in miR-214<sup>-/-</sup>. T cell activation, proliferation and chemotaxis pathways were differentially affected. MiR-214<sup>-/-</sup> prevented Ang II-induction of profibrotic T cell cytokines (<i>IL-17</i>, <i>TNF-α, IL-9</i>, and <i>IFN-γ</i>) and chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, and CXCR3). This manifested in reduced in vitro and in vivo T cell chemotaxis resulting in attenuation of profibrotic perivascular inflammation. Translationally, we show that miR-214 is increased in plasma of patients with hypertension and is directly correlated to pulse wave velocity as a measure of vascular stiffness.T-cell-derived miR-214 controls pathological perivascular fibrosis in hypertension mediated by T cell recruitment and local profibrotic cytokine release."	"BACKGROUND Gastric adenocarcinoma accounts for 95% of all gastric malignant tumors. The purpose of this research was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of gastric adenocarcinoma by use of bioinformatics methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS The gene microarray datasets of GSE103236, GSE79973, and GSE29998 were imported from the GEO database, containing 70 gastric adenocarcinoma samples and 68 matched normal samples. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis were applied to screened DEGs; Cytoscape software was used for constructing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and to perform module analysis of the DEGs. UALCAN was used for prognostic analysis. RESULTS We identified 2909 upregulated DEGs (uDEGs) and 7106 downregulated DEGs (dDEGs) of gastric adenocarcinoma. The GO analysis showed uDEGs were enriched in skeletal system development, cell adhesion, and biological adhesion. KEGG pathway analysis showed uDEGs were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The top 10 hub genes - COL1A1, COL3A1, COL1A2, BGN, COL5A2, THBS2, TIMP1, SPP1, PDGFRB, and COL4A1 - were distinguished from the PPI network. These 10 hub genes were shown to be significantly upregulated in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues in GEPIA. Prognostic analysis of the 10 hub genes via UALCAN showed that the upregulated expression of COL3A1, COL1A2, BGN, and THBS2 significantly reduced the survival time of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Module analysis revealed that gastric adenocarcinoma was related to 2 pathways: including focal adhesion signaling and ECM-receptor interaction. CONCLUSIONS This research distinguished hub genes and relevant signal pathways, which contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms, and could be used as diagnostic indicators and therapeutic biomarkers for gastric adenocarcinoma."
"FBN1"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Elderly patients have a relatively high cardiovascular risk due to increased arterial stiffness, elevated blood pressure and decreased amounts of elastin in the arteries. The composition of the media layer in the arterial wall, comprising elastin, collagen, smooth muscle cells, proteoglycans, fibronectin and fibrillin-1, influences its mechanical properties. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene leads to increased aortic stiffness, elevated pulse pressure and aortic root dilatation. This study investigates whether there is a sex difference among hypertensive elderly patients regarding blood pressure, arterial stiffness and fibrillin-1 genotypes.A total of 315 hypertensive subjects (systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg) were included in this study (155 men and 160 women aged 71-88 years). Aortic pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were determined using SphygmoCor, and brachial blood pressure was measured using an oscillometric technique. Fibrillin-1 was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and with a capillary electrophoresis system.Females showed a significantly higher peripheral mean arterial pressure (females; 107.20 mmHg, males 101.6 mmHg, p = 0.008), central mean arterial pressure (females; 107.2 mmHg, males 101.6 mmHg p = 0.008), central systolic blood pressure (females; 148.1 mmHg, males 139.2 mmHg, p &lt;  0.001) and central pulse pressure (females; 68.9 mmHg, males 61.6 mmHg, p = 0.035) than males. Females with the Fibrillin-1 2/3 genotype showed a significantly higher augmentation index (FBN1 2/3; 39.9%, FBN1 2/2 35.0%, FBN1 2/4 35.8, p = 0.029) and systolic blood pressure (FBN1 2/3; 174.6 mmHg, FBN1 2/2168.9 mmHg, FBN1 2/4169.9 mmHg, p = 0.025) than females with the 2/2 and 2/4 genotypes.The findings of this study may indicate that hypertensive elderly females, especially elderly females with Fibrillin-1 2/3, have increased systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness."	"During osteoarthritis, chondrocytes change their spatial arrangement from single to double strings, then to small and big clusters. This change in pattern has recently been established as an image-based biomarker for osteoarthritis. The pericellular matrix (PCM) appears to degrade together alongside cellular reorganization. The aim of this study was to characterize this PCM-degradation based on the different cellular patterns. We additionally wanted to identify the earliest time point of PCM-breakdown in this physiopathological model. To this end, cartilage samples were selected according to their predominant cellular pattern. Qualitative analysis of PCM degradation was performed immunohistochemically by analysing five main PCM components: collagen type VI, perlecan, collagen type III, biglycan, and fibrillin-1 (n=6 patients). Their protein content was quantified by ELISA (127 patients). Accompanying spatial cellular rearrangement, the PCM is progressively destroyed, with a pericellular signal loss in fluorescence microscopy for collagen type VI, perlecan, and biglycan. This loss in protein signal is accompanied by a reduction in total protein content from single strings to big clusters (p&lt;0.001 for collagen type VI, p=0.003 for perlecan, and p&lt;0.001for biglycan). As a result of an increase in the number of cells from single strings to big clusters, the amount of protein available per cell also decreases for collagen type III and fibrillin-1, where total protein levels remain constant. Biochemical changes of the PCM and cellular rearrangement are thus highly interconnected hallmarks of osteoarthritis. Interestingly, the earliest point in time for a relevant PCM impairment appears to be at the transition to small clusters. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."	"Secreted a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS) proteases play crucial roles in tissue development and homeostasis. The biological and pathological functions of ADAMTS proteases are determined broadly by their respective substrates and their interactions with proteins in the pericellular and extracellular matrix. For some ADAMTS proteases, substrates have been identified and substrate cleavage has been implicated in tissue development and in disease. For other ADAMTS proteases, substrates were discovered in vitro, but the role of these proteases and the consequences of substrate cleavage in vivo remains to be established. Mutations in <i>ADAMTS10</i> and <i>ADAMTS17</i> cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), a congenital syndromic disorder that affects the musculoskeletal system (short stature, pseudomuscular build, tight skin), the eyes (lens dislocation), and the heart (heart valve abnormalities). WMS can also be caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (<i>FBN1</i>), which suggests that ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 cooperate with fibrillin-1 in a common biological pathway during tissue development and homeostasis. Here, we compare and contrast the biochemical properties of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 and we summarize recent findings indicating potential biological functions in connection with fibrillin microfibrils. We also compare ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 with their respective sister proteases, ADAMTS6 and ADAMTS19; both were recently linked to human disorders distinct from WMS. Finally, we propose a model for the interactions and roles of these four ADAMTS proteases in the extracellular matrix."	"The extracellular matrix microenvironment of adipose tissue is of critical importance for the differentiation, remodeling and function of adipocytes. Fibrillin-1 is one of the main components of microfibrils and a key player in this process. Furin processing of profibrillin-1 results in mature fibrillin-1 and releases the C-terminal propeptide as a circulating hunger hormone, asprosin. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene lead to adipose tissue dysfunction and causes Marfan syndrome, marfanoid progeroid lipodystrophy syndrome, and neonatal progeroid syndrome. Increased TGF-β signaling, altered mechanical properties and impaired adipogenesis are potential causes of adipose tissue dysfunction, mediated through deficient microfibrils. Circulating asprosin on the other hand is secreted primarily by white adipose tissue under fasting conditions and in obesity. It increases hepatic glucose production and drives insulin secretion and appetite stimulation through inter-organ cross talk. This review discusses the metabolic consequences of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-1-derived asprosin in pathological conditions. Understanding the dynamic role of fibrillin-1 in the adipose tissue milieu and of circulating asprosin in the body can provide novel mechanistic insights into how fibrillin-1 may contribute to metabolic syndrome. This could lead to new management regimens of patients with metabolic disease."	"Marfan syndrome (MFS) and related connective tissue disorders (CTDs) are increasingly recognised. Genetic testing has greatly improved the diagnostic outcome/power over the last two decades. In this study we describe a multicentre cohort of adults with MFS and related CTDs, with a particular focus on results from genetic testing.All patients with MFS and related CTDs were identified from the databases of five centres in the canton of Zurich. Echocardiographic and clinical findings including systemic Marfan score, use of medication and genetic results were retrospectively analysed. MFS was diagnosed using the revised Ghent criteria (including FBN1 genetic testing if available); other CTDs (Loeys-Dietz syndrome) were diagnosed by genetic testing only.A cohort of 103 patients were identified (62 index patients, 41 relatives of family members): 96 patients with MFS and 7 patients with other CTD, 54 males (52%), median age 23 years (range 1&amp;ndash;75). The median systemic Marfan score was 5 (range 0&amp;ndash;18). Only 40 patients (40/103, 39%) fulfilled criteria for systemic involvement (&amp;ge;7 points). A history of aortic dissection was present in 14 out of 103 patients (14%). Echocardiographic data were available for all: aortic root enlargement (Z-score &amp;ge;2 in adults, Z-score &amp;ge;3 in children) was found in 49 patients (48%) and mitral valve prolapse in 64 (62%). Genetic testing had been performed in 80 patients (78%); FBN1 mutations were present in 69 patients (86%); other pathogenic mutations could be identified in seven patients (9%); no disease-causing mutation was found in four patients, three of them fulfilling the Ghent criteria of MFS. Of the mutation-positive patients, 33 had a systemic score of &amp;ge;7 and 43 had a systemic score of &amp;ge;5. Revised Ghent criteria were fulfilled in 70 patients: in 69 patients with FBN1 mutations and 1 patient with another CTD. Recommended treatment (beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker) was taken by 63% of patients.In this cohort a high percentage of patients fulfilling the revised Ghent criteria for MFS underwent genetic testing, often leading to or confirming the diagnosis of MFS. Other CTDs could be discriminated best by genetic testing. With respect to the diagnosis of MFS and related CTDs, the usefulness of the systemic score is limited, showing the importance of genetic testing, which enabled definitive diagnosis in 95% of tested patients. Patient education on medical treatment still has to be improved. (Trial registration no: KEK-ZH-Nr. 2013-0241)."	"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal genetic disorder of connective tissue, due to alterated fibrillin-1. The aim of our study was to verify the rate of fractures in children with MFS in correlation to bone mineral density and compare the prevalence to the general population in the same latitude. We enrolled 80 patients (37 girls and 43 boys) with the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, median age 10 y (3 to 17 years). Fracture occurrence was inferred from medical records of patients with MFS. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at lumbar spine, femoral neck and total femur by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. BMD values were expressed as z-scores, and adjusted for height using height-for-age z-scores. Bone turnover markers and vitamin D were measured. We assessed incidence of fracture in general pediatric population of our geographic area (45°N latitude). A total of 24 fractures were recorded in 21 patients (15 boys and 6 girls), involving both short and long bones, due to mild or moderate trauma. An incidence estimate has been calculated for each year, and an average incidence of 29.2/1000 MFS patients was obtained, markedly higher (P=0.034) than the incidence of fracture calculated in the same geographical area in pediatric patients (15.8/1000). We did not detect differences in anthropometric measurements, BMD values and biochemical indices between patients who fractured and patients who did not. Similarly, no differences were found between patients on losartan therapy and patients not in treatment for the same variables. In conclusion, the incidence of fractures was higher in patients with MFS compared to general population of the same age and latitude. The management of MFS must account bone status health and start strategies of fracture prevention."	"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations of the FBN1 gene encoding fibrillin-1, which leads to overexpression of transforming growth factor-β, increased hyaluronan deposition, and matrix metalloproteinase activity in the media of the aorta and other muscular arteries. Marfan syndrome patients present with connective tissue laxity and aneurysmal changes to muscular arteries. Successful medical and surgical intervention has prolonged the life expectancy of MFS patients, which can allow atypical presentations of the syndrome to manifest. We present a case of a 49-year-old man with MFS who developed an ulnar artery aneurysm that was treated by excision and vein grafting."	"Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is responsible for haploinsufficient and autosomal dominant Marfan syndrome. Even in the same Marfan pedigree, penetrance and expressivity in heterozygous individuals can differ and result in variable disease onset and severity. Thus, other factors in addition to mutations in FBN1 are likely to contribute to the disease. In this study, we examined the regulation of FBN1 in porcine Marfan syndrome model, focusing on DNA methylation patterns distinguishable as wild-type (WT) and FBN1 null (KO) alleles in heterozygous cells. Most importantly, the ratio of the transcriptionally active hypomethylated WT allele was altered during cellular passage and highly correlated with FBN1 mRNA level compared with that in the KO allele. Transcribed FBN1 RNA from the KO allele was abolished after splicing coupled with translational initiation, suggesting that the functional FBN1 mRNA levels were affected by DNA methylation of the WT allele."	"Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening disease, of which genetic abnormalities are considered as important risk factors. The present research aims at identifying causal variants in Chinese patients with sporadic non-syndromic type A TAAD (ATAAD).Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 73 sporadic Chinese patients with ATAAD, 30 TAAD associated genes were curated for bioinformatic analyses. Clinical differences were compared between patients with and without causal variants.15 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified (8 novel and 7 previously described) in 4 known TAAD-causal genes (FBN1, TGFBR2, SMAD3 and ACTA2) in 15 individuals, including 11 variants in FBN1 (7 missense, 3 truncating, and 1 splicing variants), 2 missense variants in TGFBR2, 1 ACTA2 frameshift variant and 1 SMAD3 frameshift variant. Significant clinical differences were found between patients with and without causal variants. Patients with TAAD-causal variants proved to have an earlier onset age, a more dilated aorta, and relatively intractable subtypes. Even without risk factor like hypertension, they might still suffer from TAAD with TAAD-causal variants.The variants identified in our research might not only result in the occurrence of ATAAD, but also add complexities and difficulties to the clinical practice. Our data demonstrated that WES was an effective tool for determining genetic etiologies of non-syndromic ATAAD and could be helpful in genetic counseling for ATAAD patients and their at-risk family members."	"To evaluate aortic disease progression and reintervention after an initial thoracic aortic dissection in pathogenic variant carriers.Of 175 participants diagnosed with thoracic aortic dissection, 31 had a pathogenic variant (pathogenic group) across 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFBR2) identified by whole exome sequencing. Those with benign or normal variants (benign/normal group, n = 144) comprised the control group. Clinical data were collected through medical record review (1985-2018) and supplemented with the National Death Index database (December 2018).The entire cohort (n = 175) consisted of 108 type A aortic dissections and 67 type B aortic dissections, similarly distributed between groups. The pathogenic group was significantly younger (43 vs 56 years, P &lt; .0001) and had significantly more aortic root replacements and similar extents of arch replacement at initial type A aortic dissection repair. The median follow-up time was 7.5 (4.6-12) years. After initial treatment, the pathogenic group required significantly more aortic reinterventions (median 1 vs 0, P &lt; .0001) and mean cumulative aortic reinterventions for each patient (10 years: 1 vs 0.5, P = .029). Both incidence rate (12%/year vs 1.2%/year, P = .0001) and cumulative incidence of reinterventions (9 years: 70% vs 6%, P &lt; .0001) for the preserved native aortic root were significantly higher in the pathogenic group, but were similar for the preserved native aortic arch and distal aorta between groups. Ten-year survival was similar in the pathogenic and benign/normal groups (92% vs 85%).Aggressive aortic root replacement and similar arch management should be considered in pathogenic variant carriers at initial type A aortic dissection repair compared with benign/normal variant carriers."	"Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder with a wide range of severities. Ninety-five percent of MFS probands have a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1); however, there are a high number of unique mutations complicating attempts at establishing any phenotype-genotype correlations for this disease (Tiecke et al., European Journal of Human Genetics, 2001, 9, 13-21). One of the few extant genotype-phenotype correlations is in exon 24-32 which have been associated with a severe pediatric presentation of neonatal MFS with predominately cardiovascular symptoms. We present a 24-year-old male patient with a heterozygous de novo variant NM_000138.4: c.3037G&gt;A (p.G1013R) located in exon 25 of the FBN1 gene. The patient was found to have dysplastic mitral and tricuspid valves with dilated aortic root at 9 months of age. This is a notable case in that the location of this patient's mutation and his age of symptom onset would indicate a guarded prognosis. Further, this mutation, FBN1 G1013R, has been reported in the literature in four other unrelated patients all of whom presented at a young age with cardiac involvement and all of whom had relative longevity when compared to other patients with mutations in this exon 24-32 hot spot. These findings may represent a more specific genotype-phenotype correlation within this mutational hot spot."	"Aortic dissection is a rare and emergent condition. Aortic dissection during pregnancy is not much known but it is quite lethal to both mother and infant. Earlier reports published show that clinicians conducted hysterectomies during cesarean section to avoid anticoagulant-induced uterine bleeding during the following aortic surgery.A woman (38, gravida 1, para 0) in the 37th gestational week suffered an acute, severe, sharp pain in the chest and back. She was diagnosed with Standford type A aortic dissection and suspected with Marfan syndrome. An emergency cesarean section was performed immediately to deliver the baby. Since the patient was on anticoagulants during aortic replacement, so Cook balloon was inserted into the uterus to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. This helped to maintain the uterus intact. Family genetic testing showed that the patient was a carrier of FBN1 mutation which was inherited from the patient's mother, and the newborn also carried the mutation. Hence the patient was concluded to be positive for Marfan syndrome.It is important that clinicians should pay attention to the possibility of aortic dissection in a pregnant woman with chest, abdominal or back pain. In this case study, we employed Cook balloon during cesarean section to avoid anticoagulant-induced uterine bleeding during the following aortic surgery."	"Intraplaque neovascularization is an important feature of unstable human atherosclerotic plaques. However, its impact on plaque formation and stability is poorly studied. Because proliferating endothelial cells generate up to 85% of their ATP from glycolysis, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of glycolytic flux by the small-molecule 3PO (3-[3-pyridinyl]-1-[4-pyridinyl]-2-propen-1-one) could have beneficial effects on plaque formation and composition. Approach and Results: ApoE<sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> (apolipoprotein E deficient) mice treated with 3PO (50 µg/g, ip; 4×/wk, 4 weeks) showed a metabolic switch toward ketone body formation. Treatment of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Fbn1<sup>C1039G+/-</sup> mice with 3PO (50 µg/g, ip) either after 4 (preventive, twice/wk, 10 weeks) or 16 weeks of Western diet (curative, 4×/wk, 4 weeks) inhibited intraplaque neovascularization by 50% and 38%, respectively. Plaque formation was significantly reduced in all 3PO-treated animals. This effect was independent of intraplaque neovascularization. In vitro experiments showed that 3PO favors an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage subtype and suppresses an M1 proinflammatory phenotype. Moreover, 3PO induced autophagy, which in turn impaired NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B) signaling and inhibited TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha)-mediated VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) upregulation. Consistently, a preventive 3PO regimen reduced endothelial VCAM-1 expression in vivo. Furthermore, 3PO improved cardiac function in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Fbn1<sup>C1039G+/-</sup> mice after 10 weeks of treatment.Partial inhibition of glycolysis restrained intraplaque angiogenesis without affecting plaque composition. However, less plaques were formed, which was accompanied by downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules-an event that depends on autophagy induction. Inhibition of coronary plaque formation by 3PO resulted in an overall improved cardiac function."	"Elastic fibres provide tissues with elasticity and flexibility. In the healthy human cornea, elastic fibres are limited to the posterior region of the peripheral stroma, but their specific functional role remains elusive. Here, we examine the physical and structural characteristics of the cornea during development in the mgΔ<sup>loxPneo</sup> dominant-negative mouse model for Marfan syndrome, in which the physiological extracellular matrix of its elastic-fibre rich tissues is disrupted by the presence of a dysfunctional fibrillin-1 glycoprotein. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated a reduced corneal thickness in the mutant compared to wild type mice from embryonic day 16.5 until adulthood. X-ray scattering and electron microscopy revealed a disruption to both the elastic fibre and collagen fibril ultrastructure in the knockout mice, as well as abnormally low levels of the proteoglycan decorin. It is suggested that these alterations might be a result of increased transforming growth factor beta signalling. To conclude, this study has demonstrated corneal structure and ultrastructure to be altered when fibrillin-1 is disrupted and has provided insights into the role of fibrillin-1 in developing a functional cornea."	"Reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis. Herein, we investigated the effects of l-Arginine, the main precursor of NO, on the osteogenic differentiation of aortic interstitial valve cells (VICs).We isolated a clonal population of bovine VICs that expresses osteogenic markers and induces calcification of collagen matrix after stimulation with endotoxin (LPS 500 ng/mL). VICs were treated in vitro with different combinations of LPS ± l-Arginine (50 or 100 mM) and cell extracts were collected to perform proteomic (iTRAQ) and gene expression (RT-PCR) analysis.l-Arginine prevents the over-expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP, p &lt; 0.001) and reduces matrix calcification (p &lt; 0.05) in VICs treated with LPS. l-Arginine also reduces the over-expression of inflammatory molecules induced by LPS (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta, p &lt; 0.001). The proteomic analysis allowed to identify 49 proteins with an altered expression profile after stimulation with LPS and significantly modified by l-Arginine. These include proteins involved in the redox homeostasis of the cells (i.e. Xanthine Oxidase, Catalase, Aldehyde Oxidase), remodeling of the extracellular matrix (i.e. ADAMTSL4, Basigin, COL3A1) and cellular signaling (i.e. Fibrillin-1, Legumain, S100A13). The RT-PCR analysis confirmed the modifications of Fibrillin-1, ADAMTSL4, Basigin and Xanthine Oxidase, whose expression levels increase after stimulation with LPS and are reduced by l-Arginine (p &lt; 0.05).l-Arginine prevents osteogenic differentiation of VICs and reduces matrix calcification. This effect is achieved through the modulation of proteins involved in the cellular redox system, remodeling of extracellular matrix and inflammatory activation of VICs."	"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the multiple differentiations of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, few studies have focused on the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs in the odontogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs).hDPSCs were induced to differentiate into odontoblasts in vitro, and the expression profiles of lncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in differentiated and undifferentiated cells were obtained by microarray. Bioinformatics analyses including Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, pathway analysis, and binding site prediction were performed for functional annotation of lncRNA. miRNA/odontogenesis-related gene networks and lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks were constructed. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the expression of selected genes. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis were used to explore the location and function of lncRNA-G043225. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the binding sites of miR-588 with G043225 and Fibrillin 1 (FBN1).We identified 132 lncRNAs, 114 miRNAs, and 172 mRNAs were differentially expressed. GO analysis demonstrated that regulation of the neurogenic locus notch homolog (Notch), Wnt, and epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB) signaling pathways and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity were related to odontogenic differentiation. Pathway analysis indicated that the most significant pathway was the forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway, which is related to odontogenic differentiation. Two odontogenesis-related gene-centered lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks were successfully constructed. The qRT-PCR validation results were consistent with the microarray analysis. G043225 mainly locating in cytoplasm was proved to promote the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs via miR-588 and FBN1.This is the first study revealing lncRNA-associated ceRNA network during odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs using microarray, and it could provide clues to explore the mechanism of action at the RNA-RNA level as well as novel treatments for dentin regeneration based on stem cells."	"<i>Introduction</i>. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare connective tissue disorder attributed to a defect in the fibrillin-1 gene. Aortic aneurysms and dissection are common causes of morbidity and mortality in Marfan syndrome. <i>Case Report</i>. A 43-year-old female with a history of MFS and a 4.0 cm dilated ascending aorta presented to her cardiologist reporting that since a C-section two years prior, the left side of her abdomen painlessly protruded when standing. An outpatient CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis noted a 5.5 cm abdominal aortic dissection, and she was directed to the hospital. Repeat CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a 5.6 cm dissecting aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on a nitroglycerin drip to maintain systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg. The patient underwent repair of her abdominal aortic dissection via a retroperitoneal approach, and she tolerated the procedure well. She was started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg BID and aspirin 81 mg postoperatively. She was safely discharged with follow-up care. <i>Conclusion</i>. This case stresses the importance of having a low threshold to obtain imaging in a MFS patient with protruding abdomen, even though the patient may not have pain and be hemodynamically stable."	"Aortic dissection (AD) is a heterogeneous genetic disease with high morbidity and mortality. Although many genes predispose patients to AD, the pathogenic spectrum remains incomplete. This study aims to (a) investigate whether genotype differences exist between Stanford A and B AD individuals, and (b) broaden the pathogenic genetic spectrum of AD and reported novel variants of AD-associated genes. The DNA of 72 unrelated Han Chinese individuals with AD was tested by whole-exome sequencing. Of 142 AD-associated genes, 10 pathogenic variants, and 48 likely pathogenic variants in 36 genes were identified among 39 cases. The diagnostic yield was 54.2%. Of the 58 positive variants, 27 were novel. FBN1 was the most frequently positive gene in both Stanford A and Stanford B. Twenty-seven positive variants from 18 COL family genes were distributed in 36.8% of Stanford A and 6.7% of Stanford B cases. We emphasize that positive variants of COL family genes show distribution predominance and strong pathogenicity in Stanford A, while positive variants of smooth muscle cell pathway genes present distribution advantages mainly in Stanford B cases. Our findings provide a new perspective for both the pathogenic mechanism and the treatment of AD."	"Asprosin, a novel glucogenic adipokine, is encoded by two exons (exon 65 and exon 66) of the gene <i>Fibrillin 1</i> (<i>FBN1</i>) and mainly synthesized and released by white adipose tissue during fasting. Asprosin plays a complex role in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral tissues, and organs. It is involved in appetite, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR), cell apoptosis, etc. In this review, we will summarize the newly discovered roles of asprosin in metabolic diseases including diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which may contribute to future clinical diagnosis and treatment."	"Fibrillin-1 is the major component of extracellular matrix microfibrils. Microfibrils dysfunction is responsible for the onset of various connective tissue diseases, including Marfan syndrome. Although ADAMTSL (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-like) 6β is one of the fibrillin-1 binding proteins, the detailed mechanism underlying the involvement of ADAMTSL6β in microfibril formation remains unclear. In this study, we created deletion mutants of ADAMTSL6β and examined their interactions with fibrillin-1 assembly. Pull-down assay of the ADAMTSL6β deletion mutants and fibrillin-1 protein revealed that ADAMTSL6β binds to fibrillin-1 through the third thrombospondin type I domain. Furthermore, we observed that formation of fibrillin-1 matrix assembly was enhanced in MG63 cells, expressing full-length ADAMTSL6β, when compared with that of wild type MG63 cells. While MG63 cells expressing Δ TSP3-ADAMTSL6β form showed enhanced assembly formation, Δ TSP2-ADAMTSL6β form did not enhance that, indicating the difference between Δ TSP2-Δ TSP3 has a critical role for fibrillin-1 assembly. As the difference of Δ TSP2-Δ TSP3 is the third thrombospondin type I domain, we concluded that the third thrombospondin type I domain of ADAMTSL6β influence the microfibril formation. Our data are the functional presentation of the biological role of ADAMTSL6β in the process of microfibril formation."
"LOX"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Core browning of 'Whangkeumbae' pear has become an urgent problem in the Chinese pear industry, which often appears after several months of low-temperature storage. However, little is known regarding the crosstalk between physiology and molecular mechanisms regulating the core browning process of the pear. In this study, the physiological and genetic responses of the core were identified during storage. The results showed that the malonyldialdehyde (MDA) content, electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) content and superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>·<sup>-</sup>) production rate progressively increased during the browning process. Polyphenoloxidase (PPO), phospholipase D (PLD) and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity initially slightly increased but then sharply increased during the later storage stage. A total of 33,265 unigenes was generated via high-throughput sequencing, and 5121 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. These DEGs were functionally annotated and some core browning-related DEGs involved in the redox reaction, membrane lipid metabolism and enzymatic browning were also determined. We found that the changes in the gene expression accorded with the physiological variation, indicating the close crosstalk between physiological and genetic response during storage. Our study provides a basis for future research on the core browning mechanism during pear storage."	"Human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase-1 (h15-LOX-1 or ALOX15) and platelet 12-lipoxygenase (h12-LOX or ALOX12) catalysis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the maresin precursor, 14S-hydroperoxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid (14S-HpDHA), were investigated to determine their product profiles and relative rates in the biosynthesis of the key maresin intermediate, 13S,14S-epoxy-4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid (13S,14S-epoxy-DHA). Both enzymes were shown to be efficient at converting DHA to 14S-HpDHA, with h12-LOX having a 39-fold greater kcat/KM value (14.0 +/- 0.8 s-1μM-1) than that of h15-LOX-1 (0.36 +/- 0.08 s-1μM-1) and a 1.8-fold greater 14S-HpDHA product selectivity, 81% and 46%, respectively. However, h12-LOX was shown to be markedly less effective at producing 13S,14S-epoxy-DHA from 14S-HpDHA than h15-LOX-1, with a 4.6-fold smaller kcat/KM value, 0.0024 +/- 0.0002 s-1μM-1 and 0.11 +/- 0.006 s-1μM-1, respectively. This is the first evidence of the ability of h15-LOX-1 to catalyze this reaction and reveals a novel and more effective in vitro pathway for maresin biosynthesis. In addition, it was observed that the epoxidation of 14S-HpDHA is negatively regulated through allosteric oxylipin binding to h15-LOX-1 and h12-LOX. For h15-LOX-1, the oxylipins, 14S-HpDHA (Kd = 6.0 μM), 12S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE) (Kd = 3.5 μM), and 14S-hydroxy-7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid (14S-HDPAω-3) (Kd = 4.0 μM) were shown to decrease 13S,14S-epoxy-DHA production, adding to the biological properties of the previously reported LOX allosteric site. h12-LOX was also shown to be allosterically regulated by 14S-HpDHA (Kd = 3.5 μM) and 14S-HDPAω-3 (Kd =4.0 μM), however, 12S-HETE showed no effect, indicating for the first time an allosteric response by h12-LOX to an oxylipin. Finally, 14S-HpDHA was observed to inhibit platelet aggregation at a level markedly lower than previously reported oxylipins, such as 12S-HETrE, which may have implications in the benefits of diets rich in DHA. These novel in vitro biosynthetic pathways and allosteric regulation of maresin production may help illuminate the details of in vivo maresin biosynthesis and possibly direct therapeutic interventions."	"The mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment play a crucial role in modulating cell function, and many pathophysiological processes are accompanied by variations in extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. Lysyl oxidase (LOx) is one of the enzymes involved in several ECM-stiffening processes. Here, we engineered poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels with controlled mechanical properties in the range typical of soft tissues. These hydrogels were functionalized featuring free primary amines, which allows an additional chemical LOx-responsive behavior with increase in crosslinks and hydrogel elastic modulus, mimicking biological ECM-stiffening mechanisms. Hydrogels with elastic moduli in the range of 0.5-4 kPa were obtained after a first photopolymerization step. The increase in elastic modulus of the functionalized and enzyme-responsive hydrogels was also characterized after the second-step enzymatic reaction, recording an increase in hydrogel stiffness up to 0.5 kPa after incubation with LOx. Finally, hydrogel precursors containing HepG2 (bioinks) were used to form three-dimensional (3D) <i>in vitro</i> models to mimic hepatic tissue and test PEG-based hydrogel biocompatibility. Hepatic functional markers were measured up to 7 days of culture, suggesting further use of such 3D models to study cell mechanobiology and response to dynamic variation of hydrogels stiffness. The results show that the functionalized hydrogels presented in this work match the mechanical properties of soft tissues, allow dynamic variations of hydrogel stiffness, and can be used to mimic changes in the microenvironment properties of soft tissues typical of inflammation and pathological changes at early stages (e.g., fibrosis, cancer)."	"Excessive prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> production is a hallmark of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Enhanced expression of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> receptor EP4 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been demonstrated in human AAAs. Although moderate expression of EP4 contributes to vascular homeostasis, the roles of excessive EP4 in vascular pathology remain uncertain. We aimed to investigate whether EP4 overexpression in VSMCs exacerbates AAAs. Approach and Results: We constructed mice with EP4 overexpressed selectively in VSMCs under an SM22α promoter (EP4-Tg). Most EP4-Tg mice died within 2 weeks of Ang II (angiotensin II) infusion due to AAA, while nontransgenic mice given Ang II displayed no overt phenotype. EP4-Tg developed much larger AAAs than nontransgenic mice after periaortic CaCl<sub>2</sub> application. In contrast, EP4<sup>fl/+</sup>;SM22-Cre;ApoE<sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> and EP4<sup>fl/+</sup>;SM22-Cre mice, which are EP4 heterozygous knockout in VSMCs, rarely exhibited AAA after Ang II or CaCl<sub>2</sub> treatment, respectively. In Ang II-infused EP4-Tg aorta, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocyte/macrophage infiltration and MMP-9 (matrix metalloprotease-9) activation were enhanced. An unbiased analysis revealed that EP4 stimulation positively regulated the genes binding cytokine receptors in VSMCs, in which IL (interleukin)-6 was the most strongly upregulated. In VSMCs of EP4-Tg and human AAAs, EP4 stimulation caused marked IL-6 production via TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1), NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38. Inhibition of IL-6 prevented Ang II-induced AAA formation in EP4-Tg. In addition, EP4 stimulation decreased elastin/collagen cross-linking protein LOX (lysyl oxidase) in both human and mouse VSMCs.Dysregulated EP4 overexpression in VSMCs promotes inflammatory monocyte/macrophage infiltration and attenuates elastin/collagen fiber formation, leading to AAA exacerbation."	"Leaves are formed by coordinated growth of tissue layers driven by cell proliferation and expansion. Compensation, in which a defect in cell proliferation induces compensated cell enlargement (CCE), plays an important role in cell-size determination during leaf development. We previously reported that CCE triggered by an3 mutation is observed in epidermal and subepidermal layers in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) leaves. Interestingly, CCE is induced in a non-cell-autonomous manner between subepidermal cells. However, whether CCE in the subepidermis affects cell size in the adjacent epidermis is still unclear. We induced layer-specific expression of AN3 in an3 leaves, and found that CCE in the subepidermis had little impact on cell-size determination in the epidermis, and vice versa, suggesting that CCE is induced in a tissue-autonomous manner. Examination of the epidermis in an3 leaves having AN3-positive and -negative sectors generated by Cre/lox-P revealed that, in contrast to the subepidermis, CCE occurred exclusively in AN3-negative epidermal cells, indicating a cell-autonomous action of an3-mediated compensation in the epidermis. These results clarified that the epidermal and subepidermal tissue layers have different cell autonomies in CCE. In addition, quantification of cell expansion kinetics in epidermal and subepidermal tissues of the an3 showed that the tissues exhibited a similar temporal profile to reach a peak cell-expansion rate as comparable to WT. This might be one feature representing that the two tissue layers retain their growth coordination even in the presence of CCE."	"An in vivo direct-immersion SPME sampling coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography - time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-ToFMS) was employed to capture real-time changes in the metabolome of 'Honeycrisp' apples during ripening on the tree. This novel sampling approach was successful in acquiring a broad metabolic fingerprint, capturing unique metabolites and detecting changes in metabolic profiles associated with fruit maturation. Several metabolites and chemical classes, including volatile esters, phenylpropanoid metabolites, 1-octen-3-ol, hexanal, and (2E,4E)-2,4-hexadienal were found to be up-regulated in response to fruit maturation. For the first time, Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, metabolites with important biological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, were detected in apples. Considering the elimination of oxidative degradation mechanisms that adversely impact the representativeness of metabolome obtained ex vivo, and further evidence that lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway contributes to volatile production in intact fruit, in vivo DI-SPME represents an attractive approach for global plant metabolite studies."	"Much of the morbidity and mortality due to prostate cancer happen because of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which invariably develops after anti-androgenic therapy. FDA-approved enzalutamide is commonly prescribed for CRPC which works by blocking androgen receptor function. However, even after initial good response, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (ERPC) develops which eventually leads to widespread metastasis. Management of ERPC is extremely difficult because available therapeutic regimen cannot effectively kill and eliminate ERPC cells. Though the mechanism behind enzalutamide-resistance is not properly understood, over-activation of c-Myc has been found to be a common event which plays an important role in the maintenance and progression of ERPC phenotype. However, direct-targeting of c-Myc poses special problem because of its non-enzymatic nature and certain amount of c-Myc activity is needed by non-cancer cells as well. Thus, c-Myc has emerged as an elusive target which needs to be managed by novel agents and strategies in a cancer-specific way. We investigated the effects of pharmacological and genetic inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) on cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasive potential of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. Transcriptional activity of c-Myc was analyzed by DNA-binding, luciferase-assays, and expression of c-Myc-target genes. We found that 5-Lox regulates c-Myc signaling in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and inhibition of 5-Lox by Quiflapon/MK591 or shRNA interrupts oncogenic c-Myc signaling and kills ERPC cells by triggering caspase-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, MK591 does not affect normal, non-cancer cells in the same experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that inhibition of 5-Lox may emerge as a promising new approach to effectively kill ERPC cells sparing normal cells and suggest that development of a long-term curative therapy of prostate cancer may be possible by killing and eliminating ERPC cells with suitable 5-Lox-inhibitors."	"To investigate the presence of the variants of lysyl oxygenase (<i>LOX</i>) and superoxide dismutase 1 (<i>SOD1</i>) genes in Brazilian patients with advanced keratoconus.Donor genomic DNA extracted from blood samples was screened for 5'UTR, exonic <i>LOX,</i> and <i>SOD1</i> variants in a subset of 26 patients presenting with advanced keratoconus (KISA <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">                        <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo>                    </mml:math> 1000% and I-S <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">                        <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo>                    </mml:math> 2.0) by Sanger sequencing. The impact of non-synonymous amino acid changes was evaluated by SIFT, PMUT, and PolyPhen algorithms. The Mutation Taster tool was used to evaluate the potential impact of formation of new donor and acceptor splice sites in the promoter region of affected volunteers carrying sequence variants. A 7-base <i>SOD1</i> deletion (IVS2 + 50del7bp) previously associated with keratoconus was screened in 140 patients presenting classical keratoconus by gel fragment analysis, and positive samples were sequenced for confirmation.We found an unreported missense variant in <i>LOX</i> exon 6 in one heterozygous patient, leading to substitution of proline with threonine at residue 392 (p. Thr392Pro) of <i>LOX</i> protein sequence. This mutation was predicted to be potentially damaging to <i>LOX</i> protein. Another <i>LOX</i> variant, Arg158Gln, was also detected in another patient but predicted to be non-pathogenic. Two additional new polymorphisms in <i>LOX</i> 5'UTR region (-116C <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">                        <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo>                    </mml:math> T and -58C <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">                        <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo>                    </mml:math> T) were found in two patients presenting with advanced keratoconus and were predicted to modulate or create donor/acceptor splice sites in <i>LOX</i> transcripts. Additionally, <i>SOD1</i> deletion was detected in one patient presenting with severe keratoconus, not in control samples.We described three novel LOX polymorphisms identified for the first time in Brazilian patients with advanced keratoconus, as well as a previously described <i>SOD1</i> deletion strongly associated with keratoconus. A possible role of these variants in modulating transcript levels in the cornea of affected individual requires further investigation."	"The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can preserve heart structure and function, but its role in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis (AS) is unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role and biological function of HRD1 in AS. HRD1 expression was significantly decreased in atherosclerotic intima and ox-LDL led to a decrease of HRD1 level in endothelial cells (ECs). Forced expression of HRD1 inhibited the endothelial apoptosis induced by ox-LDL. The transcription factor KLF2 specifically bound to the HRD1 promoter and positively regulated HRD1 expression. KLF2 up-regulation could reverse the decrease of HRD1 level in ECs treated with ox-LDL. Further analysis showed that HRD1 interacted with LOX-1 and promoted ubiquitination and degradation of LOX-1 by the proteasome. Deletion of LOX-1 attenuated the ECs apoptosis induced by HRD1 downregulation. Pravastatin, which protected EC from damage via a KLF2-dependent mechanism, could dose-dependently enhanced HRD1 expression in EC exposed to ox-LDL. Interestingly, interference of HRD1 abolished the cytoprotective effect of pravastatin. Collectively, our data indicate that decreased HRD1 expression leads to apoptosis of ECs and restoration of HRD1 expression could represent a novel strategy for human AS therapy."	"Urolithins, gut microbial metabolites derived from ellagic acid (EA), reach significant concentrations in the human colon. Urolithin-A (Uro-A) exerts anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We hypothesized that urolithins could modulate the biosynthesis of leukocyte-derived inflammatory eicosanoids from the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-LOX/COX-2 pathways, relevant in the onset and progression of IBDs, including 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (5-HETEs), leukotriene-B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub> ), prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub> ) and hemiketals (HKE<sub>2</sub> and HKD<sub>2</sub> ).Leukocytes, obtained from six healthy donors, were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and calcium ionophore A23187. Urolithins, at concentrations found in the human colon (1-15 μM), decreased eicosanoid biosynthesis and COX-2 levels in the activated leukocytes. In contrast, EA and conjugated urolithins (glucuronides and sulfates) were inactive. Uro-A and isourolithin-A (IsoUro-A) reduced the formation of the 5-LOX/COX-2 products HKE<sub>2</sub> and HKD<sub>2</sub> through the COX-2 pathway (down-regulation of COX-2 and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> ), whereas urolithin C reduced 5-HETE and LTB<sub>4</sub> via inhibition of 5-LOX.Our results show that physiologically relevant colonic urolithins target eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways. The effect on HKs and LTB<sub>4</sub> formation is unprecedented and expands the knowledge on anti-inflammatory mechanisms of urolithins against IBDs. This article is protected by copyright.

"Our own studies and those of others have shown that defects in essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolism occurs in age-related disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, immune dysfunction and cancer. It has been noted that in all these disorders there could occur a defect in the activities of desaturases, cyclo-oxygenase (COX), and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes leading to a decrease in the formation of their long-chain products gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This leads to an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxanes (TXs), and leukotrienes (LTs) and a decrease in anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins and maresins. All these bioactive molecules are termed as bioactive lipids (BALs). This imbalance in the metabolites of EFAs leads to low-grade systemic inflammation and at times acute inflammatory events at specific local sites that trigger the development of various age-related disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, and immune dysfunction as seen in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, nephritis and other localized inflammatory conditions. This evidence implies that methods designed to restore BALs to normal can prevent age-related disorders and enhance longevity and health."	"PH46A (1) demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory activity in phenotypic models but its mechanism and site of action have been elusive. Current study focused on the bioactivity of PH46 (2) and related novel indane dimers (6-10) to investigate the impact of changes in substitution and stereochemistry at the C-1 and C-2 positions of the PH46 (2) scaffold.Cytotoxicity profiles of compounds were established using THP-1 macrophages and SW480 cells. Effects of the compounds were then evaluated at 10 µm using 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) and 15-LOX enzymes, and 5-LOX binding was evaluated in silico against NDGA, nitric oxide (NO) released from LPS-induced SW480 cells and cytokines in THP-1 macrophages (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ) and in SW480 cells (IL-8).PH46 (2) and 7 cause reduction in NO, inhibition of 5-LOX with high binding energy and no cytotoxicity effects in THP-1 macrophages and SW480 cell lines (up to 50 µm). The cytokine profiling of the series demonstrated inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-α in THP-1 macrophages together with IL-8 in SW480 cells.The observed profile of cytokine modulation (IL-6/ TNF-α, IL-8) and inhibition of release of NO and 5-LOX may contribute to the in vivo effects demonstrated by indane dimers and PH46A (1) in murine models of colitis."	"Osteoporosis is associated with vessel diseases attributed to hyperlipidemia, and bone resorption by multinucleated osteoclasts is related to lipid metabolism. In this study, we generated <i>low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)/lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1)</i> double knockout (dKO) mice. We found that, like <i>LDLR</i> single KO (sKO), <i>LDLR/LOX-1</i> dKO impaired cell-cell fusion of osteoclast-like cells (OCLs). <i>LDLR/LOX-1</i> dKO and <i>LDLR</i> sKO preosteoclasts exhibited decreased uptake of LDL. The cell surface cholesterol levels of both <i>LDLR/LOX-1</i> dKO and <i>LDLR</i> sKO osteoclasts were lower than the levels of wild-type OCLs. Additionally, the amount of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the cell surface was attenuated in <i>LDLR/LOX-1</i> dKO and <i>LDLR</i> sKO pre-OCLs, while the PE distribution in wild-type OCLs was concentrated on the filopodia in contact with neighboring cells. Abrogation of the ATP binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) transporter, which transfers PE to the cell surface, caused decreased PE translocation to the cell surface and subsequent cell-cell fusion. The findings of this study indicate the involvement of a novel cascade (LDLR∼ABCG1∼PE translocation to cell surface∼cell-cell fusion) in multinucleation of OCLs."	"Background Leukocyte-directed biosynthesis of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrates physiological inflammation after myocardial infarction. Deficiency of SPMs drives pathological and nonresolving inflammation, leading to heart failure (HF). Differences in SPMs and inflammatory responses caused by sex-specific differences are of interest. We differentiated leukocyte-directed biosynthesis of lipid mediators in male and female mice, focusing on leukocyte populations, structural remodeling, functional recovery, and survival rates. Methods and Results Risk-free male and female C57BL/6 mice were selected as naïve controls or subjected to myocardial infarction surgery. Molecular and cellular mechanisms that differentiate survival, heart function, and structure and leukocyte-directed lipid mediators were quantified to describe physiological inflammation after myocardial infarction. Female mice show improved survival in acute HF but no statistical difference during chronic HF compared with male mice. Female mice improved survival is marked with functional recovery and limited remodeling compared with male mice. Male and female mice are similarly responsive to arachidonate lipoxygenase (<i>LOX-5</i>, <i>LOX-12</i>, <i>LOX</i>-15) or cyclooxygenase (<i>COX-1</i>, <i>COX-2</i>) in acute HF and particularly male infarcted heart had overall increased SPMs. Female cardiac healing is marked with the biosynthesis of differential p450-derived product, particularly 11,12 epoxyeicosatrienoic acid in acute HF. A sex-specific difference of dendritic cells in acute HF is distinct, with limited changes in chronic HF. Conclusions Cardiac repair is marked with increased SPM biosynthesis in male mice and amplified epoxyeicosatrienoic acid in female mice. Female mice showed improved survival, functional recovery, and limited remodeling, which are signs of fine-tuned physiological inflammation after myocardial infarction. These results rationalize the sex-specific precise therapies and differential treatments in acute and chronic HF."	"Asian Taenia is a human-infecting Taenia tapeworm known as Taenia asiatica following morphological examination of adult and larval stages of the tapeworm by Eom and Rim (1993). The life cycle of T. asiatica differs from that of T. saginata in its intermediate host (pigs versus cattle) as well as in the infected organs (liver versus muscle). T. asiatica can be differentiated from T. solium and T. saginata by examination of morphological characteristics such as the scolex, mature and gravid proglottids in the adult stage, and the scolex and bladder surface in the larval stage. T. asiatica has been identified in Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Lao PDR, Nepal and India. The molecular tools employed for T. asiatica identification have been developed to differentiate T. asiatica from other human-infecting Taenia tapeworms based on genetic information such as nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial genes, nuclear ribosomal genes and nuclear genes that lead to development of the subsequent molecular techniques, such as PCR-RFLP, PCR-RAPD, BESST-base, LAMP and qPCR. Investigation of the phylogenetic relationships among human Taenia species revealed that T. asiatica is a sister species with T. saginata, which is genetically more similar than other Taenia species in terms of the nucleotide sequences of cox1, nad1 and 28S rDNA. The mitochondrial genomes of human Taenia tapeworms comprise 13,703bp (T. asiatica), 13,670bp (T. saginata) and 13,709bp (T. solium), and contain 36 genes including 12 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs, a small and a large subunit), and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Sequence differences in the full genome of T. asiatica and T. saginata mitochondria is 4.6%, while T. solium differs by 11%. Hox gene orthology in T. asiatica was established by comparative analysis with Platyhelminthes Hox genes. T. asiatica Hox revealed six Hox orthologs including two lab/Hox1, two Hox3, one Dfd/Hox4 and one Lox/Lox4. Hybridization between T. asiatica and T. saginata was definitely observed in these species which are sympatrically endemic in the regions of Korea, Thailand, China and Lao PDR. Comparative analyses of T. asiatica, T. saginata and T. solium genomes were also reported with genome features. Taenia asiaticus nomen novum was proposed for T. asiaticaEom and Rim, 1993 which is a homonym of T. asiatica Linstow, 1901 (Davaineidae)."	"In response to tissue injury, stromal cells secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) components that remodel the tissue and lead to fibrosis. Parenchymal stellate cells are the primary contributors to fibrosis in models of hepatocellular and cholestatic injury. The liver comprises different, heterogenous compartments; stromal cells within those compartments might have unique identities and regional functions. The portal tract contains the bile duct, which is surrounded by stromal cells often called portal fibroblasts. We investigated the contributions of these cells to hepatic injury.We performed studies with Gli1:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; Rosa26:lox-STOP-lox-tdTomato mice. Mice underwent bile duct ligation or were fed 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine to induce cholestatic injury or were given CCL<sub>4</sub> to induce liver fibrosis. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence, and mesenchymal cells were isolated. We performed lineage tracing experiments to determine the fates of peribiliary mesenchymal cells (PMCs) that surround the bile duct after cholestatic and hepatocellular injury. We used cell sorting, combined with RNA-sequencing, to isolate stellate cells and PMCs, and identified determinants of cell identity within each population. Liver tissues were obtained from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or without disease and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR.Gli1 was a marker of mesenchymal cells that surround the biliary tree, but not epithelial cells of the canals of Hering. Lineage-traced Gli1<sup>+</sup> PMCs proliferated and acquired a myofibroblast phenotype after cholestatic injury; Gli1<sup>+</sup> PMCs were found only surrounding the main duct of a portal tract, but not the epithelial cells of the ductular reaction, which were instead encased by stellate cells. Compared with stellate cells, Gli1<sup>+</sup> PMCs expressed a different subset of genes, including genes that are markers of active hedgehog signaling, Osr1 (encodes a transcription factor), and ECM-related genes. Loss of hedgehog signaling reduced expression of Osr1 and PMC-specific ECM genes. Liver tissues from patients with liver disease had increased expression of genes that define PMC identity, compared with control liver tissues.In lineage-tracing studies of mice, we found that Gli1<sup>+</sup> PMCs are a subset of stromal cells characterized by active hedgehog signaling that proliferate, acquire a myofibroblast phenotype, and surround the biliary tree in response to cholestatic injury."	"Remodelling of collagen fibers has been described during every phase of cancer genesis and progression. Changes in morphology and organization of collagen fibers contribute to the formation of microenvironment that favors cancer progression and development of metastasis. However, there are only few data about remodelling of collagen fibers in healthy looking mucosa distant from the cancer. Using SHG imaging, electron microscopy and specialized softwares (CT-FIRE, CurveAlign and FiberFit), we objectively visualized and quantified changes in morphology and organization of collagen fibers and investigated possible causes of collagen remodelling (change in syntheses, degradation and collagen cross-linking) in the colon mucosa 10 cm and 20 cm away from the cancer in comparison with healthy mucosa. We showed that in the lamina propria this far from the colon cancer, there were changes in collagen architecture (width, straightness, alignment of collagen fibers and collagen molecules inside fibers), increased representation of myofibroblasts and increase expression of collagen-remodelling enzymes (LOX and MMP2). Thus, the changes in organization of collagen fibers, which were already described in the cancer microenvironment, also exist in the mucosa far from the cancer, but smaller in magnitude."	"Two novel resistant QTLs mapped and candidate genes identified for Aspergillus flavus resistance in cultivated peanut using SLAF-seq. Aflatoxin contamination in peanuts caused by Aspergillus flavus is a serious food safety issue for human health around the world. Host plant resistance to fungal infection and reduction in aflatoxin are crucial for mitigating this problem. Identification of the resistance-linked markers can be used in marker-assisted breeding for varietal development. Here we report construction of two high-density genetic linkage maps with 1975 SNP loci and 5022 SNP loci, respectively. Two consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified as qRAF-3-1 and qRAF-14-1, which located on chromosomes A03 and B04, respectively. QTL qRAF-3-1 was mapped within 1.67 cM and had more than 19% phenotypic variance explained (PVE), while qRAF-14-1 was located within 1.34 cM with 5.15% PVE. While comparing with the reference genome, the mapped QTLs, qRAF-3-1 and qRAF-14-1, were located within a physical distance of 1.44 Megabase pair (Mbp) and 2.22 Mbp, harboring 67 and 137 genes, respectively. Among the identified candidate genes, six genes with the same function were found within both QTLs regions. In addition, putative disease resistance RPP13-like protein 1 (RPP13), lipoxygenase (Lox), WRKY transcription factor (WRKY) and cytochrome P450 71B34 genes were also identified. Using microarray analysis, genes responded to A. flavus infection included coding for RPP13, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing-like protein, and Lox which may be possible candidate genes for resistance to A. flavus. The QTLs and candidate genes will further facilitate marker development and validation of genes for deployment in the molecular breeding programs against A. flavus in peanuts."	"Oleacein is a secoiridoid group polyphenol found mostly in Olea europea L. and Ligustrum vulgare L. (Oleaceae). The aim of the present study was to investigate a potential role of oleacein in prevention of the foam cell formation.Oleacein was isolated from Ligustrum vulgare leaves. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained from monocytes cultured with Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)Then, cells were incubated with 20 M or 50 M of oleacein and with oxidized low-density&amp;nbsp;lipoprotein (oxLDL) (50 g/mL). Visualization of lipid deposition within macrophages was carried out using Oil-Red-O. Expression of CD36, Scavenger receptor A1 (SRA1) and Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) was determined by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using Annexin V assay. STAT3 and Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase type 1 (ACAT1)levels were determined by ELISA. P-STAT3, P-JAK1, P-JAK2 expressions were determined by Western blot (WB).Oleacein in dose-dependent manner significantly reduced lipid deposits in macrophages as well as their expression of selected scavenger receptors. The highest decrease of expression was found for CD36 and SRA1 receptors, from above 20% to more than 75% compared to oxLDL and the lowest for LOX-1 receptor, from approx. 8% to approx. 25% compared to oxLDL-stimulated macrophages. Oleacein significantly reduced (2.5-fold) early apoptosis of oxLDL-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, oleacein significantly increased the protein expression of JAK/STAT3 pathway and had no effect on ACAT1 level.Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that oleacein inhibits foam cell formation in human monocyte-derived macrophages and thus can be a valuable tool in the prevention of early and advanced atherosclerotic lesions."	"Inflammation is strictly associated with cancer and plays a key role in tumor development and progression. Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that inflammation can predispose to tumors, therefore targeting inflammation and the molecules involved in the inflammatory process could represent a good strategy for cancer prevention and therapy. In the past, several clinical studies have demonstrated that many anti-inflammatory agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are able to interfere with the tumor microenvironment by reducing cell migration and increasing apoptosis and chemo-sensitivity. This review focuses on the link between inflammation and cancer by describing the anti-inflammatory agents used in cancer therapy, and their mechanisms of action, emphasizing the use of novel anti-inflammatory agents with significant anticancer activity."
"MYH11"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"The development of fully functional small diameter vascular grafts requires both a properly defined vessel conduit and tissue-specific cellular populations. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from the Wharton's Jelly (WJ) tissue can be used as a source for obtaining vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), while the human umbilical arteries (hUAs) can serve as a scaffold for blood vessel engineering.To develop VSMCs from WJ-MSCs utilizing umbilical cord blood platelet lysate.WJ-MSCs were isolated and expanded until passage (P) 4. WJ-MSCs were properly defined according to the criteria of the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy. Then, these cells were differentiated into VSMCs with the use of platelet lysate from umbilical cord blood in combination with ascorbic acid, followed by evaluation at the gene and protein levels. Specifically, gene expression profile analysis of VSMCs for <i>ACTA2</i>, <i>MYH11</i>, <i>TGLN</i>, <i>MYOCD</i>, <i>SOX9</i>, <i>NANOG</i> homeobox, <i>OCT4</i> and <i>GAPDH</i>, was performed. In addition, immunofluorescence against ACTA2 and MYH11 in combination with DAPI staining was also performed in VSMCs. HUAs were decellularized and served as scaffolds for possible repopulation by VSMCs. Histological and biochemical analyses were performed in repopulated hUAs.WJ-MSCs exhibited fibroblastic morphology, successfully differentiating into &quot;osteocytes&quot;, &quot;adipocytes&quot; and &quot;chondrocytes&quot;, and were characterized by positive expression (&gt; 90%) of CD90, CD73 and CD105. In addition, WJ-MSCs were successfully differentiated into VSMCs with the proposed differentiation protocol. VSMCs successfully expressed <i>ACTA2, MYH11, MYOCD, TGLN</i> and <i>SOX9</i>. Immunofluorescence results indicated the expression of ACTA2 and MYH11 in VSMCs. In order to determine the functionality of VSMCs, hUAs were isolated and decellularized. Based on histological analysis, decellularized hUAs were free of any cellular or nuclear materials, while their extracellular matrix retained intact. Then, repopulation of decellularized hUAs with VSMCs was performed for 3 wk. Decellularized hUAs were repopulated efficiently by the VSMCs. Biochemical analysis revealed the increase of total hydroyproline and sGAG contents in repopulated hUAs with VSMCs. Specifically, total hydroxyproline and sGAG content after the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> wk was 71 ± 10, 74 ± 9 and 86 ± 8 μg hydroxyproline/mg of dry tissue weight and 2 ± 1, 3 ± 1 and 3 ± 1 μg sGAG/mg of dry tissue weight, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed between all study groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).VSMCs were successfully obtained from WJ-MSCs with the proposed differentiation protocol. Furthermore, hUAs were efficiently repopulated by VSMCs. Differentiated VSMCs from WJ-MSCs could provide an alternative source of cells for vascular tissue engineering."	"To search for specific protein makers and target proteins for intervention with Yimusake Tablets (YT) in the penile tissue of rats with ED induced by compound cold stress and explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of ED.Eighty adult male rats were screened and divided into three groups, normal control (n = 10), ED model control (n = 15) and YT intervention (n = 15). The model of compound cold stress-induced ED was established in the latter two groups, and meanwhile the animals in the YT intervention group were treated with oral YT for 2 weeks. After that, proteins were extracted from the penile tissues of the rats for screening and identification by iTRAQ labeling combined with LC-MS-MS proteomics, and the IPA bioinformatics software was used for analysis of differentially expressed proteins.A total of 48 differentially expressed proteins were identified from the penile tissue of the ED model controls, of which 18 were associated with endothelial function, 5 with smooth muscle activity and 4 with inflammation, involving the biological processes of glucose metabolism and alcohol catabolism and the signaling pathways of glucose metabolism, calcium and RXR activation. In comparison, 29 differentially expressed proteins were identified from the rats in the YT intervention group, of which 5 were associated with endothelial function, 1 with smooth muscle activity and 4 with inflammation, involving the biological processes of glucose metabolism, vasodilation and acute-phase response and the signaling pathways glucose metabolism, RXR activation and acute-phase response. Seven ED-associated candidate biomarkers were obtained from the differentially expressed proteins in the ED model control and YT intervention group, including Collagen alpha-1(III) chain（COL3α1）, Collagen alpha-1(I) chain（COL1α1）, Collagen alpha-2(I) chain（COL1α2）, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase（GAPDH）, T-kininogen 1（MAP1）,Biglycan（BGN）, and Myosin-11（MYH11）.Changes of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle functions in the penile tissue are likely to be the key mechanisms underlying the development and progression of compound stress-induced ED, which is also associated with inflammation as well as the interaction of the identified differentially expressed proteins and their participation in the relevant signaling pathways. The 7 proteins obtained can be used as the markers of compound stress-induced ED in the rat penile tissue, of which MAP1, GAPDH, BGN and MYH11 may serve as target proteins for YT intervention."	"To explore the thoracic ascending aortic （TAA） pathophysiological characteristics of heterozygous mutant <i>Myh</i>11 <sup>R247C/+</sup> mice under the norepinephrine-induced hypertension mode.Female heterozygous mutant <i>Myh</i>11 <sup>R247C/+</sup> and wild type <i>Myh</i>11 <sup>+/+</sup> mice were selected as experimental group (HET group) and control group (WT group)，respectively. The hypertensive model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of norepinephrine (NE)，and TAA diameter and invasive blood pressure (Bp) data were collected dynamically in real time using high-frequency ultrasound imaging and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring technique，so as to indirectly analyze TAA compliance of two groups of mice. At the same time，the incidences of hemothorax and TAA rupture were further analyzed by autopsy and histology.After injection of NE，heterozygous mice did not show a higher Bp increase percentage in systole or diastole comparing with wildtype mice. However，heterozygous mice exhibited 17% and 32% higher TAA diameter dilation percentage than wildtype ones in systole and diastole respectively. Two heterozygous mice had TAA dissection and rupture，and the incidence of hemothorax in heterozygous mice (3/5) was higher than that in wildtype (0/5).It was very likely that the altered TAA wall compliance of mutant <i>Myh</i>11 <sup>R247C/+</sup> mice had led to a higher TAA dilation degree than that in wildtype，and even could be the potential reason of TAA dissection and rupture."	"<b>Rationale:</b> microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression by negatively regulating translation of target genes. While the role of several miRNAs in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been extensively characterized, the function of miR-128-3p (miR-128) is still unknown. <b>Objective:</b> To determine if miR-128 modulates VSMC phenotype, and to define the underlying mechanisms. <b>Methods and Results:</b> We screened for miRNAs whose expression is modulated by an altered DNA methylation status in VSMCs, and among the hits we selected miR-128. We found that miR-128 was expressed in various tissues, primary murine cells, and pathological murine and human vascular specimens. Through gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we determined that miR-128 affects VSMC proliferation, migration, differentiation, and contractility. The alterations of those properties were dependent upon epigenetic regulation of key VSMC differentiation genes; notably, Kruppel-like factor 4 was found to be a direct target of miR-128 and able to modulate the methylation status of the pivotal VSMC gene Myosin Heavy Chain 11 (Myh11). Finally, in vivo lentiviral delivery of miR-128 prevented intimal hyperplasia in a mouse model of carotid restenosis without modifying vital cardiovascular parameters. <b>Conclusions:</b> miR-128 is a critical modulator of VSMCs and is regulated by epigenetic modifications upon stress. Its modulation in the context of disease could be exploited for therapeutic purposes."	"Del(16q) is an uncommon cytogenetic abnormality that can occur in different types of myeloid neoplasms. A small number of cases with del(16q) have been reported. Here, we report del(16q) in an adult patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML). Examination of bone marrow aspirate smears and cytochemical stains, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping diagnosed the case as AMML. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for inv(16) was performed using the CBFB-MYH11 translocation dual fusion probe. Accidently, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a loss of 16q22 in most of the examined interphase cells, indicating the presence of del(16q). The CBFB-MYH11 translocation dual fusion probe can be very helpful in detecting del(16q)."	"Serial assessments of measurable (or minimal) residual disease (MRD) by qPCR may identify nascent relapse in children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and enable pre-emptive therapy. We investigated the kinetics and prognostic impact of recurrent fusion transcripts (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, KMT2A-MLLT3 or KMT2A-ELL) in 774 post-induction samples from bone marrow (BM, 347) and peripheral blood (PB, 427) from 75 children with AML. BM MRD persistence during consolidation did not increase the risk of relapse, and MRD at therapy completion did not correlate to outcome (HR = 0·64/MRD log reduction (CI: 0·32-1·26), P = 0·19). In contrast, 8/8 patients with detectable MRD in PB after first consolidation relapsed. Persistence (n = 4) and shifting from negative to positive (n = 10) in PB during follow-up predicted relapse in 14/14 patients. All 253 PB samples collected during follow-up from 36 patients in continuous complete remission were MRD negative. In core-binding factor AML, persistent low-level MRD positivity in BM during follow-up was frequent but an increment to above 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> heralded subsequent haematological relapse in 12/12 patients. We demonstrate that MRD monitoring in PB after induction therapy is highly informative and propose an MRD increment above 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> in PB and BM as a definition of molecular relapse since it always leads to haematological relapse."	"BACKGROUND Rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is associated with high rates of mortality around the world. Use of intestinal probiotics can regulate the pathophysiology of aneurysms, but the details of the mechanism involved have been unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS The GEO2R analysis website was used to detect the DEGs between IAs, AAAs, samples after supplementation with probiotics, and normal samples. The online tool DAVID provides functional classification and annotation analyses of associated genes, including GO and KEGG pathway. PPI of these DEGs was analyzed based on the STRING database, followed by analysis using Cytoscape software. RESULTS We found 170 intersecting DEGs (contained in GSE75240 and more than 2 of the 4 aneurysms datasets), 5 intersecting DEGs (contained in all datasets) and 1 intersecting DEG (contained in GSE75240 and all IAs datasets). GO analysis results suggested that the DEGs primarily participate in signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune response, response to drug, extracellular matrix organization, cell-cell signaling, and inflammatory response in the BP terms, and the KEGG pathways are mainly enriched in focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, amoebiasis, chemokine signaling pathway, proteoglycans, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in cancer pathways. Through PPI network analysis, we confirmed 2 candidates for further study: CAV1 and MYH11. These downregulated DEGs are associated with the formation of aneurysms, and the change of these DEGs is the opposite in probiotics-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that MYH11 and CAV1 are potential target genes for prevention of aneurysms. Further experiments are needed to verify these findings."	"Despite the well-defined role of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RUNX1/RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11 transcripts in core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after intensive chemotherapy, there has been a paucity of data assessing the utility of MRD monitoring at and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).Patients with CBF AML who underwent HSCT in complete remission (first or second) from January 2007 through December 2018 were included in this analysis.MRD by polymerase chain reaction at HSCT was assessed in 50 of 76 patients, and 44 (88%) had evidence of MRD (MRDpos). MRDpos patients had 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates of 69.3% and 66.3%, respectively. Six MRD-negative patients had 3-year OS and LFS rates of 100% and 100%, respectively. Thirty-five of the 70 evaluable patients (50%) had a day +100 MRD assessment by RT-PCR, and 14 (40%) were MRDpos. The presence of MRD by RT-PCR on day +100 was not associated with lower estimates of LFS (75% vs 82.2%; P = .3) but was associated with a higher relapse incidence, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (27.6% vs 9.7%; P = .2).Durable complete remissions can be achieved in patients with CBF AML with HSCT even if they are MRDpos by RT-PCR at HSCT. The clinical impact of frequent MRD monitoring for identifying a group at high risk for early relapse and then for determining the best time point for therapeutic interventions to prevent impending relapse warrants investigation in prospectively designed clinical trials."	"All organs of human body are a conglomerate of various cells types with multi-directional interplay between the different cells and the surrounding microenvironment, leading to a stable tissue formation, homeostasis and function. In order to develop a functional smooth muscle tissue, we need to simulate and create a multicellular microenvironment. The multi-lineage adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC), which can be easily harvested in large numbers, may provide an alternative cell source for the replacement of smooth muscle cells (SMC) in cell-based detrusor bioengineering therapeutic approaches. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pre-differentiated smooth muscle-like ADSC (pADSC) can support SMC to generate stable smooth muscle tissue trough remodeling of ECM and factor secretion. Rat SMC and pADSC were mono- and co-cultured in the cell ratios 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:5 (SMC-pADSC) and grown for up to two weeks in vitro. The expression of the SMC-specific markers alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), calponin, myosin heavy chain 11 (MyH11) and smoothelin was assessed and cell proliferation and contractility analyzed. Proteomic analysis of the secretome (cell-cell contact were compared to a 1:1 non-contact co-culture) and the cell pellets was performed, with the focus on ECM deposition and remodeling, integrin expression and growth factor secretion. SMC and pADSC were strongly positive for all smooth muscle markers. After one and two weeks of culture, the 1:1 cell ratio developed a significantly higher number of smooth muscle organoids and improved contractility. These organoids were highly structured, consisting of an SMC core surrounded by a pADSC layer. The deposition of various EMC proteins, such as collagens 1a1, 1a2, 2a1, 3a1, 5a2, 6a2, 12a1 and fibrillin 1 was significantly increased. A decreased MMP3, MMP9 and MMP13 secretion, as well as an increased TIMP1 and TIMP2 secretion were found in the contact co-culture compared to the monoculture controls. SMC-pADSC 1:1 co-cultures exhibits an improved cell proliferation, contractility and organoid formation compared to all other ratios and monoculture, while retaining a stable phenotype that is comparable to the SMC monoculture. These effects are mediated by increased ECM deposition and tight ECM remodeling by the secreted MMP and TIMP."	"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with either t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) is referred to as core binding factor (CBF) AML. Although categorized as favorable risk, long-term survival for these patients is only ∼50% to 60%. Mutated (mut) or overexpressed KIT, a gene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, has been found almost exclusively in CBF AML and may increase the risk of disease relapse. We tested the safety and clinical activity of dasatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, in combination with chemotherapy. Sixty-one adult patients with AML and CBF fusion transcripts (RUNX1/RUNX1T1 or CBFB/MYH11) were enrolled on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 10801. Patients received cytarabine/daunorubicin induction on days 1 to 7 and oral dasatinib 100 mg/d on days 8 to 21. Upon achieving complete remission, patients received consolidation with high-dose cytarabine followed by dasatinib 100 mg/d on days 6 to 26 for 4 courses, followed by dasatinib 100 mg/d for 12 months. Fifteen (25%) patients were older (aged ≥60 years); 67% were CBFB/MYH11-positive, and 19% harbored KITmut. There were no unexpected or dose-limiting toxicities. Fifty-five (90%) patients achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 45 months, only 16% have relapsed. The 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 75% and 77% (79% and 85% for younger patients [aged &lt;60 years], and 60% and 51% for older patients). Patients with KITmut had comparable outcome to those with wild-type KIT (3-year rates: disease-free survival, 67% vs 75%; overall survival, 73% vs 76%), thereby raising the question of whether dasatinib may overcome the negative impact of these genetic lesions. CALGB 10801 was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01238211."	"The MYH11 gene codes for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, which has a critical function in maintaining vascular wall stability. Patients with this mutation most commonly have aortic and cardiac defects. Documented involvement of intracranial vessels is exceptional.A 29-year-old woman with a history of patent ductus arteriosus and aortic dissection was found to have incidental bilateral stenosis of the terminal internal carotid arteries as well as the proximal anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, and posterior cerebral arteries on magnetic resonance angiography that was obtained for unrelated symptoms. There was no evidence of basal collateral formation, and a generalized straightening of the vessels was observed. These angiographic findings have been typically observed in patients with ACTA2 mutations. Thus, genetic testing was pursued, which uncovered the presence of an MYH11 mutation. Follow-up imaging at 51 months demonstrated that the intracranial stenosis remained stable without evidence of basal collateral formation. She did not experience any neurologic events during the follow-up interval.Intracranial vessel involvement in patients with MYH11 mutations is rare. Vigilant cerebrovascular monitoring should be practiced in this population to guide appropriate management. Reporting of similar cases is important to improve understanding of the development of idiopathic intracranial stenosis in young individuals."	"Transposable element (TE)-derived sequences comprise more than half of the human genome, and their presence has been documented to alter gene expression in a number of different ways, including the generation of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms. Alternative splicing has been associated with tumorigenesis for a number of different cancers. The objective of this study was to broadly characterize the role of human TEs in generating alternatively spliced transcript isoforms in cancer. To do so, we screened for the presence of TE-derived sequences co-located with alternative splice sites that are differentially used in normal versus cancer tissues. We analysed a comprehensive set of alternative splice variants characterized for 614 matched normal-tumour tissue pairs across 13 cancer types, resulting in the discovery of 4820 TE-generated alternative splice events distributed among 723 cancer-associated genes. Short interspersed nuclear elements (Alu) and long interspersed nuclear elements (L1) were found to contribute the majority of TE-generated alternative splice sites in cancer genes. A number of cancer-associated genes, including <i>MYH11</i>, <i>WHSC1</i> and <i>CANT1</i>, were shown to have overexpressed TE-derived isoforms across a range of cancer types. TE-derived isoforms were also linked to cancer-specific fusion transcripts, suggesting a novel mechanism for the generation of transcriptome diversity via <i>trans</i>-splicing mediated by dispersed TE repeats. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation'."	"Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are characterized by a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Contractile differentiation is governed by myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), in particular myocardin (MYOCD), and when their drive is lost, the cells become proliferative and synthetic with an expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER is responsible for assembly and folding of secreted proteins. When the load on the ER surpasses its capacity, three stress sensors (activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6], inositol-requiring enzyme 1α [IRE1α]/X-box binding protein 1 [XBP1], and PERK/ATF4) are activated to expand the ER and increase its folding capacity. This is referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we hypothesized that there is a reciprocal relationship between SMC differentiation and the UPR. Tight negative correlations between SMC markers (MYH11, MYOCD, KCNMB1, SYNPO2) and UPR markers (SDF2L1, CALR, MANF, PDIA4) were seen in microarray data sets from carotid arterial injury, partial bladder outlet obstruction, and bladder denervation, respectively. The UPR activators dithiothreitol (DTT) and tunicamycin (TN) activated the UPR and reduced MYOCD along with SMC markers in vitro. The IRE1α inhibitor 4μ8C counteracted the effect of DTT and TN on SMC markers and MYOCD expression. Transfection of active XBP1s was sufficient to reduce both MYOCD and the SMC markers. MRTFs also antagonized the UPR as indicated by reduced TN and DTT-mediated induction of CRELD2, MANF, PDIA4, and SDF2L1 following overexpression of MRTFs. The latter effect did not involve the newly identified MYOCD/SRF target MSRB3, or reduced production of either XBP1s or cleaved ATF6. The UPR thus counteracts SMC differentiation via the IRE1α/XBP1 arm of the UPR and MYOCD repression."	"This study investigated the diagnostic utility of nontargeted genomic testing in patients with pediatric heart disease.We analyzed genome sequencing data of 111 families with cardiac lesions for rare, disease-associated variation.In 14 families (12.6%), we identified causative variants: seven were de novo (ANKRD11, KMT2D, NR2F2, POGZ, PTPN11, PURA, SALL1) and six were inherited from parents with no or subclinical heart phenotypes (FLT4, DNAH9, MYH11, NEXMIF, NIPBL, PTPN11). Outcome of the testing was associated with the presence of extracardiac features (p = 0.02), but not a positive family history for cardiac lesions (p = 0.67). We also report novel plausible gene-disease associations for tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary stenosis (CDC42BPA, FGD5), hypoplastic left or right heart (SMARCC1, TLN2, TRPM4, VASP), congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (UBXN10), and early-onset cardiomyopathy (TPCN1). The identified candidate genes have critical functions in heart development, such as angiogenesis, mechanotransduction, regulation of heart size, chromatin remodeling, or ciliogenesis.This data set demonstrates the diagnostic and scientific value of genome sequencing in pediatric heart disease, anticipating its role as a first-tier diagnostic test. The genetic heterogeneity will necessitate large-scale genomic initiatives for delineating novel gene-disease associations."	"Vascular calcification is a life-threatening clinical condition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with reduced zinc serum levels. Anemia is another frequent complication of CKD. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizers, also known as HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHI), are promising candidates to treat CKD-associated anemia by increasing erythropoietin synthesis. Recent evidence suggests that HIFs play a pivotal role in vascular calcification. Our study explored feasible impacts of HIF PHI on phosphate (Pi)-induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and tested whether zinc might inhibit this mineralization process. Treatment of VSMCs with PHI aggravated Pi-induced calcium deposition and Pi uptake. PHI promoted Pi-induced loss of smooth muscle cell markers (ACTA-2, MYH11, SM22α) and enhanced osteochondrogenic gene expression (Msx-2, BMP-2, Sp7) triggering osteochondrogenic phenotypic switch of VSMCs. These effects of PHI paralleled with increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) expression, decreased Runx2 Ser451 phosphorylation, and reduced cell viability. Zinc inhibited Pi-induced mineralization of VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner and also attenuated the pro-calcification effect of PHI in Pi-induced mineralization. Zinc inhibited osteochondrogenic phenotypic switch of VSMCs reflected by lowering Pi uptake, decreasing the expressions of Msx-2, BMP-2, and Sp7 as well as the loss of smooth muscle cell-specific markers. Zinc preserved phosphorylation state of Runx2 Ser451, decreased PDK4 level, and restored cell viability. PHI alone reduced the expression of smooth muscle markers without inducing mineralization, which was also inhibited by zinc. In addition, we observed a significantly lower serum zinc level in CKD as well as in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy compared to healthy individuals. Conclusion - PHI promoted the loss of smooth muscle markers and augmented Pi-induced osteochondrogenic phenotypic switch leading to VSMCs calcification. This mineralization process was attenuated by zinc. Enhanced vascular calcification is a potential risk factor during PHI therapy in CKD which necessitates the strict follow up of vascular calcification and zinc supplementation."	"Gastrointestinal motility disorders include a spectrum of mild to severe clinical phenotypes that are caused by smooth muscle dysfunction. We investigated the genetic etiology of severe esophageal, gastric, and colonic dysmotility in two unrelated families with autosomal dominant disease presentation. Using exome sequencing, we identified a 2 base pair insertion at the end of the myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) gene in all affected members of Family 1 [NM_001040113:c.5819_5820insCA(p.Gln1941Asnfs*91)] and a 1 base pair deletion at the same genetic locus in Proband 2 [NM_001040113:c.5819del(p.Pro1940Hisfs*91)]. Both variants are predicted to result in a similarly elongated protein product. Heterozygous dominant negative MYH11 pathogenic variants have been associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection while biallelic null alleles have been associated with megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome. This report highlights heterozygous protein-elongating MYH11 variants affecting the SM2 isoforms of MYH11 as a cause for severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, and we hypothesize that the mechanistic pathogenesis of this disease, dominant hypercontractile loss-of-function, is distinct from those implicated in other diseases involving MYH11 dysfunction."	"Congenital ductus arteriosus aneurysms develop in the third trimester of fetal life, possibly due to abnormal intimal cushion formation or elastin expression in the ductal wall. It is often diagnosed in infants before 2 months of age. Most have a benign course and resolve spontaneously. However, life-threatening complications have been reported. We report a case of large ductal aneurysm diagnosed incidentally in a neonate, in whom there was a novel mutation in the smooth muscle myosin protein gene-MYH11."	"The prognostic impact of KIT mutation on core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) remains controversial. We registered 199 newly diagnosed de novo CBF-AML patients, aged 16 to 64 years, who achieved complete remission. They received 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine therapy and no further treatment until hematological relapse. Mutations in exons 8, 10-11, and 17 of the KIT gene were analyzed. Furthermore, we analyzed mutations in 56 genes that are frequently identified in myeloid malignancies and evaluated minimal residual disease (MRD). The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS) according to KIT mutations. The RFS in KIT-mutated patients was inferior to that in unmutated patients (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.00; P = .003). Based on subgroup analysis, KIT mutations had a prognostic impact in patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, but not in those with CBFB-MYH11, and only exon 17 mutation had a significant prognostic impact. Multivariate Cox regression analysis with stepwise selection revealed that the KIT exon 17 mutation and the presence of extramedullary tumors in patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and loss of chromosome X or Y and NRAS mutation in patients with CBFB-MYH11 were poor prognostic factors for RFS. MRD was evaluated in 112 patients, and it was associated with a poorer RFS in the patients with CBFB-MYH11, but not in those with RUNX1-RUNX1T1. These results suggested that it is necessary to separately evaluate AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 according to appropriate prognostic factors. This study was registered at www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as #UMIN000003434."	"The fusion genes CBFB/MYH11 and RUNX1/RUNX1T1 block differentiation through disruption of the core binding factor (CBF) complex and are found in 10-15% of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. This AML subtype is associated with a favorable prognosis; however, nearly half of CBF-rearranged patients cannot be cured with chemotherapy. This divergent outcome might be due to additional mutations, whose spectrum and prognostic relevance remains hardly defined. Here, we identify nonsilent mutations, which may collaborate with CBF-rearrangements during leukemogenesis by targeted sequencing of 129 genes in 292 adult CBF leukemia patients, and thus provide a comprehensive overview of the mutational spectrum ('mutatome') in CBF leukemia. Thereby, we detected fundamental differences between CBFB/MYH11- and RUNX1/RUNX1T1-rearranged patients with ASXL2, JAK2, JAK3, RAD21, TET2, and ZBTB7A being strongly correlated with the latter subgroup. We found prognostic relevance of mutations in genes previously known to be AML-associated such as KIT, SMC1A, and DHX15 and identified novel, recurrent mutations in NFE2 (3%), MN1 (4%), HERC1 (3%), and ZFHX4 (5%). Furthermore, age &gt;60 years, nonprimary AML and loss of the Y-chromosomes are important predictors of survival. These findings are important for refinement of treatment stratification and development of targeted therapy approaches in CBF leukemia."	NA
"MYLK"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Diarrhea represents one of the most frequent major problems during piglets' neonatal and post-weaning periods leading to tremendous economic losses in the swine industry. Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) F4 is regarded as the most important cause of diarrhea in piglets. However, some pigs are naturally resistant to those diarrheas caused by ETEC-F4, because they have no F4 receptors (F4R) on their small intestine epithelial cells that allow F4 fimbriae attachment. Thus, our study characterized a complete transcriptome of small intestine epithelial cells of Large White piglets using RNA-Seq. The aim of the study was to identify DEGs with regard to differences in the F4R phenotypes and SNP (C/T) genotypes at <i>ITGB5</i> and important pathways associated with ETEC-F4ac susceptibility in small intestine epithelial cells of Large White piglets and derive molecular markers as a result of loss of F4acR in swine.A total of eight samples of small intestine epithelial cells obtained from Large White piglets (35 days old) used in this study were selected on the basis of two criteria. One was the adhesion phenotype to ETEC-F4ac fimbriae, and the other was the comparison of <i>ITGB5</i> SNP (C &gt; T) genotype sequences across all the samples. The samples were then divided into two groups, non-adhesive with CC genotype (n = 4), and adhesive with TT genotype (n = 4).More down-regulated DEGs (p &lt; 0.05, |log<sub>2</sub>FC| &gt; 2) were detected in the comparison of non-adhesive vs. adhesive small intestine epithelial cells in the present study. Six genes, of which two (<i>CNGA4, SLC25A31</i>) exclusively expressed and four (<i>HCN4, MYLK, KCNMA1</i>, and <i>KCNMB1)</i> DEGs with up-regulation pattern in adhesive (F4R positive) pigs were involved in two pathways associated with diarrhea. The DEGs with up-regulation pattern in non-adhesive (F4R negative) pigs were mostly engaged in multiple immune response-related pathways.The results provide insights on the biology of the phenotypes of F4R positive and negative pigs. One gene (<i>MYLK</i>) located on SSC13 locus for F4acR strongly support that it might have played a role in the adhesion phenotype which was obviously detected by adhesion assay in adhesive (F4R positive) group."	"Suicidal behavior is result of the interaction of several contributors, including genetic and environmental factors. The integration of approaches considering the polygenic component of suicidal behavior, such as polygenic risk scores (PRS) and DNA methylation is promising for improving our understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in this behavior. The aim of this study was the evaluation of DNA methylation differences between individuals with high and low genetic burden for suicidality. The present study was divided into two phases. In the first phase, genotyping with the Psycharray chip was performed in a discovery sample of 568 Mexican individuals, of which 149 had suicidal behavior (64 individuals with suicidal ideation, 50 with suicide attempt and 35 with completed suicide). Then, a PRS analysis based on summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium was performed in the discovery sample. In a second phase, we evaluated DNA methylation differences between individuals with high and low genetic burden for suicidality in a sub-sample of the discovery sample (target sample) of 94 subjects. We identified 153 differentially methylated sites between individuals with low and high-PRS. Among genes mapped to differentially methylated sites, we found genes involved in neurodevelopment (CHD7, RFX4, KCNA1, PLCB1, PITX1, NUMBL) and ATP binding (KIF7, NUBP2, KIF6, ATP8B1, ATP11A, CLCN7, MYLK, MAP2K5). Our results suggest that genetic variants might increase the predisposition to epigenetic variations in genes involved in neurodevelopment. This study highlights the possible implication of polygenic burden in the alteration of epigenetic changes in suicidal behavior."	"<b>Background:</b> UBASH3B (STS1) is an important gene that negatively regulates T-cell receptor signaling in activated T-lymphocytes that involved in cancers. However, the function of UBASH3B in prostate cancer (PCa) and the correlation between UBASH3B and tumor-infiltrating immune cells still remain unclear. <b>Methods:</b> Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were applied to detect mRNA and protein expression of UBASH3B in PCa patients and benign prostate hyperplasia patients (BPH). Clinical features of patients with PCa were recorded and Kaplan Meier curve was subsequently plotted. Based on mRNA expression of UBASH3B, patients with PCa from TCGA database were divided into low-UBASH3B-expression group and high-UBASH3B-expression group for construct lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and analyzing GO and KEGG pathways. Single gene analysis method was performed by using GSEA to interpret gene expression data in PCa. The PPI network was constructed using STRING and the correlation between UBASH3B and tumor-infiltrating immune cells was analyzed by TIMER and CIBERSORT. <b>Results:</b> The mRNA and protein expression of UBASH3B were upregulated in PCa. The abundant expression of UBASH3B is associated with poor prognosis in PCa. The subnetwork of UBASH3B contains three lncRNAs (MIAT, LINC01297, MYLK-AS1) and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-200a-3p, hsa-miR-455-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p, hsamiR- 215-5P). The mRNA expression of UBASH3B was involved in 28 KEGG pathways. GSEA analysis showed that 18 hallmark gene sets were significantly enriched in high-UBASH3B-expression, whereas 1 gene set was enriched in low-UBASH3B-expression. PPI network revealed a tightly interaction between UBASH3B and LCP2 (an immune related gene). TIMER and CIBERSORT database indicated that UBASH3B was correlated with 11 types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (naïve B cell, memory B cells, resting CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cell, activated CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cell, regulatory T cell, activated NK cell, M2 macrophages, resting dendritic cells, activated dendritic cells, resting mast cells, neutrophils). <b>Conclusions:</b> In conclusion, UBASH3B may be a novel potential prognostic biomarker and is associated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells in tumor microenvironment, suggesting UBASH3B as a potential target for future treatment of PCa."	"Prior studies have implicated myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in the regulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the renal collecting duct. To discover signaling targets of MLCK, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete the MLCK gene (<i>Mylk</i>) to obtain MLCK-null mpkCCD cells and carried out comprehensive phosphoproteomics using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture for quantification. Immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated a defect in the processing of AQP2-containing early endosomes to late endosomes. The phosphoproteomics experiments revealed that, of the 1,743 phosphopeptides quantified over multiple replicates, 107 were changed in abundance by MLCK deletion (29 decreased and 78 increased). One of the decreased phosphopeptides corresponded to the canonical target site in myosin regulatory light chain. Network analysis indicated that targeted phosphoproteins clustered into distinct structural/functional groups: actomyosin, signaling, nuclear envelope, gene transcription, mRNA processing, energy metabolism, intermediate filaments, adherens junctions, and tight junctions. There was significant overlap between the derived MLCK signaling network and a previously determined PKA signaling network. The presence of multiple proteins in the actomyosin category prompted experiments showing that MLCK deletion inhibits the normal effect of vasopressin to depolymerize F-actin, providing a potential explanation for the AQP2 trafficking defect. Changes in phosphorylation of multiple proteins in the nuclear envelope prompted measurement of nuclear size, showing a significant increase in average nuclear volume. We conclude that MLCK is part of a multicomponent signaling pathway in both the cytoplasm and nucleus that includes much more than simple regulation of conventional nonmuscle myosins through myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation."	"The purpose of this review is to discuss current knowledge on pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction. We will also review new mutations that have been identified through advancement in genetic testing, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of intestinal dysmotility and potential etiologies.With the advancements in genetic testing, new mutations have been identified in the diagnosis of megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), a disorder leading to pediatric pseudo-obstruction. MYLK, LMOD1, MYL9, and MYH11 encode for various proteins within smooth muscle cells; abnormalities within these proteins lead to abnormal intestinal smooth muscle contractions. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is defined by symptoms of bowel obstruction in the absence of a lumen-occluding lesion. CIPO is a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the enteric neurons, intestinal smooth muscle, and/or the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Symptoms can be non-specific and etiologies include both primary and secondary causes of CIPO that contribute to the delay in recognizing this condition and making the correct diagnosis. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction has been recognized in both adults and children with fundamental differences in the etiology, symptom onset, clinical features and natural history of this disorder. For this reason, it has been considered a separate entity referred to as pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction (PIPO)."	"Endometrial cancer develops as a result of abnormal cell growth associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation, excessive activation of signaling pathways and miRNA activity. The aim of this study was to determine the expression profile of genes associated with cell proliferation and to assess which miRNAs can participate in the regulation of their expression. The study enrolled 40 patients with endometrial cancer and 10 patients without neoplastic changes. The expression profile of genes associated with cell proliferation and the expression profile of miRNAs were assessed using microarrays. RT-qPCR was performed to validate mRNA microarray results. The mirTAR tool was used to identify miRNAs that regulate the activity of genes associated with cell proliferation. Decreased expression of <i>IGF1</i> and <i>MYLK</i>, as well as <i>SOD2</i> overexpression, were observed in endometrial cancer using both mRNA microarrays and RT-qPCR. Microarray analysis showed low levels of <i>NES</i> and <i>PRKCA</i>, but this was only partially validated using RT-qPCR. Reduced activity of <i>MYLK</i> may be caused by increased miR-200c, miR-155 and miR-200b expression. Cell proliferation is disturbed in endometrial cancer, which may be associated with an overexpression of miR-200a, miR-200c, and miR-155, making it a potential diagnostic marker."	"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in several malignances, involving nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a heterogeneous disease. This study investigated mechanism of serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2-alternative splicing (SRRM2-AS) in NPC cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Initially, differentially expressed lncRNAs were screened out via microarray analysis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein positive rate and microvessel density (MVD) were determined in NPC and adjacent tissues. NPC CNE-2 cells were treated with a series of vector and small interfering RNA to explore the effect of SRRM2-AS in NPC. The target relationship between myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) and SRRM2-AS was verified. Levels of SRRM2-AS, MYLK, cGMP, PKG, VEGF, PCNA, Ki-67, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase 3 were determined after transfection. Finally, the effect of SRRM2-AS on cell proliferation, colony formation, angiogenesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis in NPC was evaluated. SRRM2-AS was highly expressed and MYLK was poorly expressed in NPC tissues. VEGF protein positive rate and MVD were elevated in NPC tissues. MYLK was confirmed to be a target gene of SRRM2-AS. Silencing of SRRM2-AS elevated levels of MYLK, cGMP, PKG, Bax, and Caspase 3, but decreased levels of VEGF, PCNA, Ki-67, and Bcl-2. Especially, silencing of SRRM2-AS suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation and angiogenesis, blocked cell cycle, and enhanced cell apoptosis in NPC. Our results suggested that silencing of SRRM2-AS protected against angiogenesis of NPC cells by upregulating MYLK and activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, which provides a new target for NPC treatment."	"The lung mesenchyme gives rise to multiple distinct lineages of cells in the mature respiratory system, including smooth muscle cells of the airway and vasculature. However, a thorough understanding of the specification and mesenchymal cell diversity in the human lung is lacking.We completed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of fetal human lung tissues. Canonical correlation analysis, clustering, cluster marker gene identification and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding representation was performed in Seurat. Cell populations were annotated using ToppFun. Immunohistochemistry and <i>in situ</i> hybridisation were used to validate spatiotemporal gene expression patterns for key marker genes.We identified molecularly distinct populations representing &quot;committed&quot; fetal human lung endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Early endothelial lineages expressed &quot;classic&quot; endothelial cell markers (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule/CD31 and claudin 5), while pericytes expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein and basement membrane molecules (collagen IV, laminin and proteoglycans). We observed a large population of &quot;nonspecific&quot; human lung mesenchymal progenitor cells characterised by expression of collagen I and multiple elastin fibre genes (<i>ELN</i>, <i>MFAP2</i> and <i>FBN1</i>). We closely characterised the diversity of mesenchymal lineages defined by α<sub>2</sub>-smooth muscle actin (<i>ACTA2</i>) expression. Two cell populations, with the highest levels of <i>ACTA2</i> transcriptional activity, expressed unique sets of markers associated with airway or vascular smooth muscle cells. Spatiotemporal analysis of these marker genes confirmed early and persistent spatial specification of airway (<i>HHIP</i>, <i>MYLK</i> and <i>IGF1</i>) and vascular (<i>NTRK3</i> and <i>MEF2C</i>) smooth muscle cells in the developing human lung.Our data suggest that specification of distinct airway and vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypes is established early in development and can be identified using the markers we provide."	"Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal-hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a rare and severe disorder characterized by functional obstruction in the urinary and gastrointestinal tract. The molecular basis of this condition has been defined recently. Heterozygous variants in ACTG2, homozygous mutations in LMOD1, MYLK, and MYH9 were related to the pathogenesis of the syndrome, which encodes proteins involved in the process of smooth muscle contraction, supporting a myopathic basis for the disease. Recent studies have identified homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in MYH11 as a candidate gene of MMIHS. In this report, we described a nonconsanguineous Chinese family with three male fetuses affected with megacystis. Trio-targeted exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants, c.2051 G &gt; A (p.R684H) and c.3540_3541delinsTT (p.(E1180D, Q1181Ter)), in MYH11 (NM_001040114). The variants were inherited from the parents, respectively. Western blotting showed a marked decrease in MYH11 protein in the proband's umbilical cord tissue compared with the control sample. The study's results confirmed that MYH11 is a candidate gene for MMIHS with autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance and expanded the mutation spectrum for this clinical condition. Combining clinical phenotype with molecular diagnosis may enable the identification of candidate genes for potential monogenic diseases and facilitate accurate genetic counseling, informed decision-making, and prenatal diagnosis."	"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a common aggressive head and neck cancer. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the expression profile and biological role of circMYLK in LSCC. We found that circMYLK was highly expressed in LSCC tissues and cell lines. circMYLK overexpression promoted LSCC cell proliferation and G<sub>1</sub>/S cell cycle transition; whereas circMYLK knockdown had the contrary effects. Mechanistically, circMYLK can serve as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-195 to increase cyclin D1 expression in LSCC, and rescue experiments further showed that restoration of miR-195 could block the oncogenic role of circMYLK in LSCC. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the circMYLK/miR-195/cyclin D1 regulatory axis could affect the proliferation and cell cycle progression of LSCC cells, and may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of LSCC."	"CircRNA myosin light chain kinase (circRNA MYLK) has been shown to promote the progression of various tumor diseases. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential molecular mechanism of circMYLK in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expressions of circMYLK, miR-362-3p and Rab23 in HCC tissues and cell lines. Huh7 and Hep3B cells were selected to explore the role of circMYLK in proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells in vitro. The interaction among circMYLK, miR-362-3p and Rab23 was investigated by biological information and dual luciferase gene reporter assay. The effect of circMYLK on HCC tumor growth in vivo was studied in a tumor xenograft model in mice.CircMYLK was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, which was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In addition, knockdown of circMYLK remarkably inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. MiR-362-3p was a direct target of circMYLK, and Rab23 was a direct target gene of miR-362-3p. Meanwhile, circMYLK was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-362-3p and positively correlated with Rab23 expression. Moreover, either overexpressed miR-362-3p or silencing Rab23 could observably suppress the enhanced proliferation, invasion, and migration induced by circMYLK in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Finally, knockdown of circMYLK and overexpressed miR-362-3p could suppress the expression of Rab23, thus inhibiting the growth and proliferation of Hep3B cells in vivo.circMYLK promotes the occurrence and development of HCC by regulating the miR-362-3p/Rab23 axis, which provides a novel direction and theoretical basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC."	"Development of white striping (WS) and wooden breast (WB) in broiler breast meat have been linked to hypoxia, but their etiologies are not fully understood. This study aimed at investigating absolute expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) and genes involved in stress responses and muscle repair using a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was isolated from pectoralis major collected from male 6-week-old medium (carcass weight ≤ 2.5 kg) and heavy (carcass weight &gt; 2.5 kg) broilers. Samples were classified as &quot;non-defective&quot; (n = 4), &quot;medium-WS&quot; (n = 6), &quot;heavy-WS&quot; (n = 7) and &quot;heavy-WS+WB&quot; (n = 3) based on abnormality scores. The HIF1A transcript was up-regulated in all of the abnormal groups. Transcript abundances of genes encoding 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA), and phosphorylase kinase beta subunit (PHKB) were increased in heavy-WS but decreased in heavy-WS+WB. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was up-regulated in non-defective samples. The muscle-specific mu-2 isoform of glutathione S-transferases (GSTM2) was up-regulated in the abnormal samples, particularly in the heavy groups. The genes encoding myogenic differentiation (MYOD1) and myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) exhibited similar expression pattern, of which medium-WS and heavy-WS significantly increased compared to non-defective whereas expression in heavy-WS+WB was not different from either non-defective or WS-affected group. The greatest and the lowest levels of calpain-3 (CAPN3) and delta-sarcoglycan (SCGD) were observed in heavy-WS and heavy-WS+WB, respectively. Based on micrographs, the abnormal muscles primarily comprised fibers with cross-sectional areas ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 μm2. Despite induced glycolysis at the transcriptional level, lower stored glycogen in the abnormal muscles corresponded with the reduced lactate and higher pH within their meats. The findings support hypoxia within the abnormal breasts, potentially associated with oversized muscle fibers. Between WS and WB, divergent glucose metabolism, cellular detoxification and myoregeneration at the transcriptional level could be anticipated."	"Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIPO) is a rare gastrointestinal disorder, which affects the smooth muscle contractions of the gastrointestinal tract. Dominant mutations in the smooth muscle actin gene, ACTG2, accounts for 44%-50% of CIPO patients. Other recessive or X-linked genes, including MYLK, LMOD1, RAD21, MYH11, MYL9, and FLNA were reported in single cases. In this study, we used Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) to study 23 independent CIPO families including one extended family with 13 affected members. A dominantly inherited rare mutation, c.5819delC (p.Pro1940HisfsTer91), in the smooth muscle myosin gene, MYH11, was found in the extended family, shared by 7 affected family members but not by 3 unaffected family members with available DNA, suggesting a high probability of genetic linkage. Gene burden analysis indicates that additional genes, COL4A1, FBLN1 and HK2, may be associated with the disease. This study expanded our understanding of CIPO etiology and provided additional genetic evidence to physicians and genetic counselors for CIPO diagnosis."	"Copy number variation (CNV) is a form of genetic variation caused by genome rearrangement, with abnormal fragments ranging from 50 bp to Mb. And, CNV is closely related to disease, growth and reproductive shape of livestock. As a member of myosin light chain kinase (<i>MYLK</i>) family with serine/threonine specificity, <i>MYLK4</i> belongs to an enzyme encoded by <i>MYLK4</i> gene. Although <i>MYLK4</i> is a recognized kinase, its function has yet to be revealed in subsequent studies. This study aims to analyze CNV and genetic effects of <i>MYLK4</i> gene in goats. We used qPCR to detect CNV of <i>MYLK4</i> gene in African Nubian goat (<i>n</i> = 32), Guizhou black goat (<i>n</i> = 196) and Guizhou white goat (<i>n</i> = 95), respectively, and correlated CNV data of <i>MYLK4</i> gene with goat growth traits in Chinese goats. The results showed that the effect of <i>MYLK4</i> gene CNV on body weight, body length and body height of goats had significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, <i>Q</i> &lt; 0.05), in which CNV showed better growth traits in type of deletion. Therefore, CNV of <i>MYLK4</i> gene can be used as a molecular marker for assisted selection of goat growth traits, which provides a theoretical basis for the genetic improvement of goat breeds in China."	"Pig is one of the major dietary protein sources for human consumption, from which muscle is the largest protein origin. However, molecular mechanisms concerning early porcine embryonic muscle development distinctions between pig breeds are still unclear. In this study, an integrated analysis of transcriptome and miRNAome was conducted using longissimus dorsi muscle of 4 early embryonic stages around the primary myofiber formation time (18-, 21-, 28-, and 35-d post coitus) from 2 pig breeds (Landrace [LR] and Wuzhishan [WZS]) differing in meat mass. The global miRNA/mRNA expression profile showed that WZS prepared for myogenic developmental processes earlier than LR. After identifying and analyzing the interaction network of top 100 up-/down-regulated miRNA and their target genes, we were able to find 3 gene clusters: chromatin modification-related (Chd2, H3f3a, Chd6, and Mll1), myogenesis-related (Pax3, Pbx1, Mef2a, and Znf423), and myosin component-related (Mylk, Myo5a, Mylk4, Myh9, and Mylk2) gene clusters. These genes may involve in miRNA-gene myogenic regulatory network that plays vital role in regulating distinct early porcine embryonic myogenic processes between LR and WZS. In summary, our study reveals an epigenetic-mediated myogenic regulatory axial that will help us to decipher molecular mechanisms concerning early porcine embryonic muscle development distinctions between pig breeds."	"Tibetan chicken, an indigenous breed, is highly adapted to the extreme environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It serves as a model organism to identify genetic differences between hypoxia-adapted and lowland breeds. However, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation are yet unclear. This study aimed to identify differently abundant proteins (DAPs) and elucidate the mechanisms involved in hypoxic adaptation in the Tibetan chicken. In this study, we obtained proteome data for the embryonic heart tissues of Tibetan and Chahua chickens incubated under hypoxia (TCH and CHH) and normoxia (TCN and CHN) using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology. We identified 4210 proteins from 53,352 unique peptides in the heart tissue of chicken embryos. Pairwise TCH vs. CHH, TCH vs. TCN, CHH vs. CHN, and TCN vs. CHN comparisons revealed 118, 176, 103, and 162 differently abundant proteins, respectively. Several key proteins (EGLN1, MAP2K2, MYLK, QARS, NOTCH2, and MYH7) and pathways (glutathione metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, and vascular smooth muscle contraction) were identified and considered important candidates for high-altitude adaptation in Tibetan chicken. This study provides novel insights into the chicken embryonic heart tissue and furthers the current understanding of the mechanisms of survival among animals in high-altitude environments."	"The general transcription factor E2F1 reportedly functions in a protumorigenic manner in several cancer models. We show that the genetic context of cancer cells influence E2F1's role to impede the protumorigenic role. Thirty to fifty percent of melanoma patients carry mutant BRAF with about 90% of mutant BRAF melanomas being V<sup>600E</sup> mutation. Tissue microarrays from melanoma patients were used to establish an association between E2F1 and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> . We show for the first time that low E2F1 levels in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanomas are associated with lymph node metastasis. Genetic manipulation of E2F1 in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and BRAF<sup>wt</sup> cells were used to determine its role in malignant melanoma progression by examining effects on migration and invasion. E2F1-mediated negative regulation of myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) increased migration and invasion in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> cells by phosphorylating myosin light chain and increased stress fiber formation. We show that E2F1 inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> cells and provide evidence for a negative feedback loop between E2F1 and ERK in these cells. This study shows for the first time that E2F1 has a cancer protective role in oncogenic BRAF-activated melanoma cells and that loss of E2F1 can allow disease progression through a novel mechanism of E2F1-mediated MYLK regulation. This study has implications for oncogenic BRAF-activated tumors and resistance to targeted oncogenic BRAF therapy."	"Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have identified several causative genes for hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAADs), including Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and familial non-syndromic TAADs. Syndromic TAADs are typically caused by pathogenic variants in the transforming growth factor-β signal and extracellular matrix-related genes (e.g. FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, and COL3A1). On the other hand, approximately 20% of the non-syndromic hereditary TAADs result from altered components of the contractile apparatus of vascular smooth muscle cells, which are encoded by ACTA2, MYH11, MYLK, and PRKG1 genes; however, the remaining 80% cannot be explained by previously reported candidate genes. Moreover, the relationship between the genotype and phenotype of TAADs has extensively been reported to investigate better methods for risk stratification and further personalized treatment strategies. With regard to MFS-causing FBN1, recent reports have shown significantly increased risk of aortic events in patients carrying a truncating variant or a variant exhibiting a haploinsufficient-type effect, typically comprising nonsense or small insertions/deletions resulting in out-of-frame effects, compared to those carrying a variant with dominant negative-type effect, typically comprising missense variants. Therefore, cardiologists are required to have sufficient knowledge regarding the genetics of hereditary TAADs for providing the best clinical management, with an appropriate genetic counseling. In the current review, we present current advances in the genetics of hereditary TAADs and discuss the benefits and limitations with respect to the use of this genetic understanding in clinical settings."	"Growing evidence has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an important impact on tumorigenesis and tumor progression via a mechanism involving competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). However, their use in predicting the survival of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to develop a novel lncRNA expression-based risk score system to accurately predict the survival of patients with HCC. In our study, using expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lncRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) were explored in patients with HCC and normal liver tissues, and then a ceRNA network constructed. A risk score system was established between lncRNA expression of the ceRNA network and overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS); it was further analyzed for associations with the clinical features of patients with HCC. In HCC, 473 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 63 differentially expressed miRNAs, and 1417 differentially expressed mRNAs were detected. The ceRNA network comprised 41 lncRNA nodes, 12 miRNA nodes, 24 mRNA nodes, and 172 edges. The lncRNA expression-based risk score system for OS was constructed based on six lncRNAs (MYLK-AS1, AL359878.1, PART1, TSPEAR-AS1, C10orf91, and LINC00501), while the risk score system for RFS was based on four lncRNAs (WARS2-IT1, AL359878.1, AL357060.1, and PART1). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed the risk score systems for OS or RFS were significant independent factors adjusted for clinical factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the area under the curve for the risk score system was 0.704 for OS, and 0.71 for RFS. Our result revealed a lncRNA expression-based risk score system for OS or RFS can effectively predict the survival of patients with HCC and aid in good clinical decision-making."	"Jinhua pig, a well-known Chinese indigenous breed, has evolved as a pig breed with excellent meat quality, greater disease resistance, and higher prolificacy. The reduction in the number of Jinhua pigs over the past years has raised concerns about inbreeding. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) along the genome have been applied to quantify individual autozygosity to improve the understanding of inbreeding depression and identify genes associated with traits of interest. Here, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of ROH using next-generation sequencing data to characterize autozygosity in 202 Jinhua pigs, as well as to identify the genomic regions with high ROH frequencies within individuals. The average inbreeding coefficient, based on ROH longer than 1 Mb, was 0.168 ± 0.052. In total, 18,690 ROH were identified in all individuals, among which shorter segments (1-5 Mb) predominated. Individual ROH autosome coverage ranged from 5.32 to 29.14% in the Jinhua population. On average, approximately 16.8% of the whole genome was covered by ROH segments, with the lowest coverage on SSC11 and the highest coverage on SSC17. A total of 824 SNPs (about 0.5%) and 11 ROH island regions were identified (occurring in over 45% of the samples). Genes associated with reproduction (<i>HOXA3, HOXA7, HOXA10</i>, and <i>HOXA11</i>), meat quality (<i>MYOD1, LPIN3</i>, and <i>CTNNBL1</i>), appetite (<i>NUCB2</i>) and disease resistance traits (<i>MUC4, MUC13, MUC20, LMLN, ITGB5, HEG1, SLC12A8</i>, and <i>MYLK</i>) were identified in ROH islands. Moreover, several quantitative trait loci for ham weight and ham fat thickness were detected. Genes in ROH islands suggested, at least partially, a selection for economic traits and environmental adaptation, and should be subject of future investigation. These findings contribute to the understanding of the effects of environmental and artificial selection in shaping the distribution of functional variants in the pig genome."
"PRKG1"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 339 million people worldwide and has a considerable impact on the pediatric population. Asthma symptoms can be controlled by pharmacological treatment. However, some patients do not respond to therapy and continue suffering from symptoms, which impair the quality of life of patients and limit their daily activity. Genetic variation has been shown to have a role in treatment response. The aim of this review is to update the main findings described in pharmacogenetic studies of pediatric asthma published from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. During this period, the response to short-acting beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids in childhood asthma has been evaluated by eleven candidate-gene studies, one meta-analysis of a candidate gene, and six pharmacogenomic studies. The findings have allowed validating the association of genes previously related to asthma treatment response (<i>ADRB2, GSDMB, FCER2, VEGFA, SPAT2SL, ASB3</i>, and <i>COL2A1</i>), and identifying novel associations (<i>PRKG1, DNAH5, IL1RL1, CRISPLD2, MMP9, APOBEC3B-APOBEC3C, EDDM3B</i>, and <i>BBS9</i>). However, some results are not consistent across studies, highlighting the need to conduct larger studies in diverse populations with more homogeneous definitions of treatment response. Once stronger evidence was established, genetic variants will have the potential to be applied in clinical practice as biomarkers of treatment response enhancing asthma management and improving the quality of life of asthma patients."	"The genetic factors and molecular mechanisms predisposing to essential tremor (ET) remains largely unknown.The objective of this study was to identify pathways and genes relevant to ET by integrating multiomics approaches.Case-control RNA sequencing of 2 cerebellar regions was done for 64 samples. A phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) of the differentially expressed genes was conducted, and a genome-wide gene association study (GWGAS) was done to identify pathways overlapping with the transcriptomic data. Finally, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was done to identify novel risk genes for ET.We identified several novel dysregulated genes, including CACNA1A and SHF. Pathways including axon guidance, olfactory loss, and calcium channel activity were significantly enriched. The ET GWGAS data found calcium ion-regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters to be significantly enriched. The TWAS also found calcium and olfactory pathways enriched. The pheWAS identified that the underexpressed differentially expressed gene, SHF, is associated with a blood pressure medication (P = 9.3E-08), which is used to reduce tremor in ET patients. Treatment of cerebellar DAOY cells with the ET drug propranolol identified increases in SHF when treated, suggesting it may rescue the underexpression.We found that calcium-related pathways were enriched across the GWGAS, TWAS, and transcriptome. SHF was shown to have significantly decreased expression, and the pheWAS showed it was associated with blood pressure medication. The treatment of cells with propranolol showed that the drug restored levels of SHF. Overall, our findings highlight the power of integrating multiple different approaches to prioritize ET pathways and genes. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."	"To evaluate aortic disease progression and reintervention after an initial thoracic aortic dissection in pathogenic variant carriers.Of 175 participants diagnosed with thoracic aortic dissection, 31 had a pathogenic variant (pathogenic group) across 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFBR2) identified by whole exome sequencing. Those with benign or normal variants (benign/normal group, n = 144) comprised the control group. Clinical data were collected through medical record review (1985-2018) and supplemented with the National Death Index database (December 2018).The entire cohort (n = 175) consisted of 108 type A aortic dissections and 67 type B aortic dissections, similarly distributed between groups. The pathogenic group was significantly younger (43 vs 56 years, P &lt; .0001) and had significantly more aortic root replacements and similar extents of arch replacement at initial type A aortic dissection repair. The median follow-up time was 7.5 (4.6-12) years. After initial treatment, the pathogenic group required significantly more aortic reinterventions (median 1 vs 0, P &lt; .0001) and mean cumulative aortic reinterventions for each patient (10 years: 1 vs 0.5, P = .029). Both incidence rate (12%/year vs 1.2%/year, P = .0001) and cumulative incidence of reinterventions (9 years: 70% vs 6%, P &lt; .0001) for the preserved native aortic root were significantly higher in the pathogenic group, but were similar for the preserved native aortic arch and distal aorta between groups. Ten-year survival was similar in the pathogenic and benign/normal groups (92% vs 85%).Aggressive aortic root replacement and similar arch management should be considered in pathogenic variant carriers at initial type A aortic dissection repair compared with benign/normal variant carriers."	"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-EOCs) is generally sensitive to front-line platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapy although most patients at an advanced stage relapse with progressive resistant disease. Clinical or molecular data to identify primary resistant cases at diagnosis are not yet available. HGS-EOC biopsies from 105 Pt-sensitive (Pt-s) and 89 Pt-resistant (Pt-r) patients were retrospectively selected from two independent tumor tissue collections. Pathway analysis was done integrating miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. Signatures were further validated in silico on a cohort of 838 HGS-EOC cases from a published dataset. In all, 131 mRNAs and 5 miRNAs belonging to different functionally related molecular pathways distinguish Pt-s from Pt-r cases. Then, 17 out of 23 selected elements were validated by orthogonal approaches (SI signature). As resistance to Pt is associated with a short progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), the prognostic role of the SI signature was assessed, and 14 genes associated with PFS and OS, in multivariate analyses (SII signature). The prognostic value of the SII signature was validated in a third extensive cohort. The expression profiles of SDF2L1, PPP1R12A and PRKG1 genes (SIII signature) served as independent prognostic biomarkers of Pt-response and survival. The study identified a prognostic molecular signature based on the combined expression profile of three genes which had never been associated with the clinical outcome of HGS-EOC. This may lead to early identification, at the time of diagnosis, of patients who would not greatly benefit from standard chemotherapy and are thus eligible for novel investigational approaches."	"Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may hold great potential in the field of pain. We systematically reviewed the literature exploring epigenetic mechanisms in people with pain. Four databases have been interrogated: MEDLINE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, Scopus, and Web of Science, following PRISMA guidelines in conducting study selection and assessment. Thirty-seven studies were included. Studies explored epigenetics in conditions such as fibromyalgia, CRPS, neuropathies, or osteoarthritis. Research focussed on genome-wide and gene-specific DNA methylation, and miRNA expression. Bioinformatics analyses exploring miRNA-associated molecular pathways were also performed. Several genes already known for their role in pain (BDNF, HDAC4, PRKG1, IL-17, TNFRSF13B, etc.), and several miRNAs linked to inflammatory regulation, nociceptive signalling and protein kinases functions have been found to differ significantly between people with chronic pain and healthy controls. Although the studies included were cross-sectional in nature, and no conclusion on causal links between epigenetic changes and pain could be drawn, we summarised the large amount of data available in literature on the topic, highlighting results that have been replicated by independent investigations. The field of pain epigenetics appears very exciting and has all the potential to lead to remarkable scientific advances. However, high-quality, well-powered, longitudinal studies are warranted. PERSPECTIVE: Though more high-quality research is needed, available research exploring epigenetic mechanisms or miRNAs in people with pain shows that genes regulating synaptic plasticity and excitability, protein kinases, and elements of the immune system might hold great potential in understanding the pathophysiology of different conditions."	"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most frequent malignancies in oral cancer. Herein, we aimed to investigate the influence of lncRNA protein kinase cGMP-dependent type I-Antisense RNA 1 (PRKG1-AS1) in OSCC progression.Basing on the data acquired from TCGA database, the expression and prognostic value of PRKG1-AS1 in OSCC patients were assessed. The expression of PRKG1-AS1 in OSCC cells was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell growth was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and colony-forming assays. Transwell assay was employed to test cell invasion and migration. The protein expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers was detected by Western blotting.The consequences displayed that PRKG1-AS1 was highly expressed in OSCC tissues and high expression of PRKG1-AS1 predicted poor outcomes. The expression of PRKG1-AS1 was higher in CAL27, SCC-9, and SCC-4 than that in normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK). The results of biological experiments showed that deficiency of PRKG1-AS1 suppressed cell growth, invasion, and migration in CAL27 cells, and over-expression of PRKG1-AS1 accelerated cell growth, invasion, and migration in SCC-4 cells. Finally, silencing of PRKG1-AS1 obviously facilitated the protein expression levels of E-cadherin and reduced levels of N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail in CAL27 cells whereas over-expression of PRKG1-AS1 led to opposite results in SCC-4 cells.These outcomes indicated that PRKG1-AS1 functioned as a facilitator in OSCC cell growth, migration, and invasion, which all might be achieved by regulating EMT."	"Achalasia is a rare idiopathic disease with a complex etio-pathogenesis still unknown. This study aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA regulatory networks underlying achalasia.The investigation was performed in tissue specimens from 11 patients and five controls using the microarray technology followed by an integrated bioinformatics analysis.One hundred and six miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 64 were down-regulated in achalasia patients. The expression of the most 10 differential expressed miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-504-5p, miR-187-3p, miR-133b, miR-200c-3p, miR-375, miR-200b-5p, miR-200b-3p, and miR203a) was confirmed by droplet digital PCR in an independent cohort. The interactions between the significant miRNAs and their targets uncovered 14 miRNA-mRNA interacting pairs with experimentally predicted genes (ie, FN1, ROCK2, DPYSL2), and 35 pairs with not experimentally target genes (ie, SULF1, MRVI1, PRKG1); all genes were involved in immune cell trafficking, skeletal and muscular system development, nervous system development macro-processes.The mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks described in this study provide new insights in the genetic background of the disease, suggesting further investigations in novel pathogenic mechanisms."	"People heterozygous for an activating mutation in protein kinase G1 (PRKG1, p.Arg177Gln) develop thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD) as young adults. Here we report that mice heterozygous for the mutation have a three-fold increase in basal protein kinase G (PKG) activity, and develop age-dependent aortic dilation. Prkg1<sup>R177Q/+</sup> aortas show increased smooth muscle cell apoptosis, elastin fiber breaks, and oxidative stress compared to aortas from wild type littermates. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-to increase wall stress in the ascending aorta-induces severe aortic pathology and mortality from aortic rupture in young mutant mice. The free radical-neutralizing vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-analog cobinamide completely prevents age-related aortic wall degeneration, and the unrelated anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine ameliorates TAC-induced pathology. Thus, increased basal PKG activity induces oxidative stress in the aorta, raising concern about the widespread clinical use of PKG-activating drugs. Cobinamide could be a treatment for aortic aneurysms where oxidative stress contributes to the disease, including Marfan syndrome."	"We previously conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) strategy for milk fatty acids in Chinese Holstein, and identified 83 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 314 suggestive significant SNPs. Among them, two SNPs, BTB-01077939 and BTA-11275-no-rs associated with C10:0, C12:0, and C14 index (P = 0.000014 ~ 0.000024), were within and close to (0.85 Mb) protein kinase, cGMP-dependent, type І (PRKG1) gene on BTA26, respectively. PRKG1 gene plays a key role in lipolysis to release fatty acids and glycerol through the hydrolysis of triacyglycerol in adipocytes. We herein considered it as a promising candidate for milk fatty acids. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PRKG1 had effects on milk fatty acids.By direct sequencing the PCR products of pooled DNA, we identified a total of six SNPs, including one in 5' flanking region, four in 3' untranslated region (UTR), and one in 3' flanking region. The single-locus association analysis was carried out, and showed that the six SNPs mainly had significant associations with C6:0, C8:0 and C17:1 (P &lt; 0.0001 ~ 0.0035). In addition, we observed a haplotype block formed by g.6903810G &gt; A and g.6904047G &gt; T with Haploview 4.1, and it was strongly associated with C8:0, C10:0, C16:1, C17:1, C20:0 and C16 index (P = &lt; 0.0001 ~ 0.0123). The SNP, g.8344262A &gt; T, was predicted to alter the binding site (BS) of transcription factor (TF) GAGA box with Genomatix software, and the subsequent luciferase assay verified that it really changed the transcriptional activity of PRKG1 gene (P = 0.0009).In conclusion, to our best of knowledge, we are the first who identified the significant effects of PRKG1 on milk fatty acids in dairy cattle."	"Thoracic aortic dissection is an emergent life-threatening condition. Routine screening for genetic variants causing thoracic aortic dissection is not currently performed for patients or family members.We performed whole exome sequencing of 240 patients with thoracic aortic dissection (n=235) or rupture (n=5) and 258 controls matched for age, sex, and ancestry. Blinded to case-control status, we annotated variants in 11 genes for pathogenicity.Twenty-four pathogenic variants in 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, and TGFBR2) were identified in 26 individuals, representing 10.8% of aortic cases and 0% of controls. Among dissection cases, we compared those with pathogenic variants to those without and found that pathogenic variant carriers had significantly earlier onset of dissection (41 versus 57 years), higher rates of root aneurysm (54% versus 30%), less hypertension (15% versus 57%), lower rates of smoking (19% versus 45%), and greater incidence of aortic disease in family members. Multivariable logistic regression showed that pathogenic variant carrier status was significantly associated with age &lt;50 (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% CI, 1.6-19.7), no history of hypertension (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.4-22.3), and family history of aortic disease (mother: OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.4-22.3, siblings: OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.1-23.9, children: OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.4-26.7).Clinical genetic testing of known hereditary thoracic aortic dissection genes should be considered in patients with a thoracic aortic dissection, followed by cascade screening of family members, especially in patients with age-of-onset &lt;50 years, family history of thoracic aortic disease, and no history of hypertension."	"Aberrant phospho-signaling is a hallmark of cancer. We investigated kinase-substrate regulation of 33,239 phosphorylation sites (phosphosites) in 77 breast tumors and 24 breast cancer xenografts. Our search discovered 2134 quantitatively correlated kinase-phosphosite pairs, enriching for and extending experimental or binding-motif predictions. Among the 91 kinases with <i>auto</i>-phosphorylation, elevated EGFR, ERBB2, PRKG1, and WNK1 phosphosignaling were enriched in basal, HER2-E, Luminal A, and Luminal B breast cancers, respectively, revealing subtype-specific regulation. CDKs, MAPKs, and ataxia-telangiectasia proteins were dominant, master regulators of substrate-phosphorylation, whose activities are not captured by genomic evidence. We unveiled phospho-signaling and druggable targets from 113 kinase-substrate pairs and cascades downstream of kinases, including AKT1, BRAF and EGFR. We further identified kinase-substrate-pairs associated with clinical or immune signatures and experimentally validated activated phosphosites of ERBB2, EIF4EBP1, and EGFR. Overall, kinase-substrate regulation revealed by the largest unbiased global phosphorylation data to date connects driver events to their signaling effects."	"Chronic hypoxia causes pulmonary hypertension (PH), vascular remodeling, right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, and cardiac failure. Protein kinase G Iα (PKGIα) is susceptible to oxidation, forming an interprotein disulfide homodimer associated with kinase targeting involved in vasodilation. Here we report increased disulfide PKGIα in pulmonary arteries from mice with hypoxic PH or lungs from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. This oxidation is likely caused by oxidants derived from NADPH oxidase-4, superoxide dismutase 3, and cystathionine γ-lyase, enzymes that were concomitantly increased in these samples. Indeed, products that may arise from these enzymes, including hydrogen peroxide, glutathione disulfide, and protein-bound persulfides, were increased in the plasma of hypoxic mice. Furthermore, low-molecular-weight hydropersulfides, which can serve as &quot;superreductants&quot; were attenuated in hypoxic tissues, consistent with systemic oxidative stress and the oxidation of PKGIα observed. Inhibiting cystathionine γ-lyase resulted in decreased hypoxia-induced disulfide PKGIα and more severe PH phenotype in wild-type mice, but not in Cys42Ser PKGIα knock-in (KI) mice that are resistant to oxidation. In addition, KI mice also developed potentiated PH during hypoxia alone. Thus, oxidation of PKGIα is an adaptive mechanism that limits PH, a concept further supported by polysulfide treatment abrogating hypoxia-induced RV hypertrophy in wild-type, but not in the KI, mice. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis of hypoxic lungs before structural remodeling identified up-regulation of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways in the KI compared with wild-type mice. Thus, disulfide PKGIα is an intrinsic adaptive mechanism that attenuates PH progression not only by promoting vasodilation but also by limiting maladaptive growth and fibrosis signaling."	"Hepatic steatosis is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. Both genetic and environmental factors are known as causes of the disease although their underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. This study investigated the association of DNA methylation with oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis. It also examined effects of food components on DNA methylation in hepatic steatosis. Genome-wide DNA methylation of oleic acid (OA)-induced lipid accumulation in vitro cell model was investigated using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Changes of DNA methylation were also analyzed after treatment with food components decreasing OA-induced lipid accumulation in the model. We identified total 81 regions that were hypermethylated by OA but hypomethylated by food components or vice versa. We determined the expression of seven genes proximally located at the selected differentially methylated regions. Expression levels of WDR27, GNAS, DOK7, MCF2L, PRKG1, and CMYA5 were significantly different between control vs OA and OA vs treatment with food components. We demonstrated that DNA methylation was associated with expression of genes in the model of hepatic steatosis. We also found that food components reversely changed DNA methylation induced by OA and alleviated lipid accumulation. These results suggest that DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms causing the hepatic steatosis and its regulation by food components provides insights that may prevent or alleviate lipid accumulation."	"Olfaction is an important sense influencing food preferences, appetite, and eating behaviors. This hypothesis-driven study aimed to assess associations between olfactory pathway gene methylation signatures, obesity features, and dietary intakes.A nutriepigenomic analysis was conducted in 474 adults from the Methyl Epigenome Network Association (MENA) project. Anthropometric measurements, clinical data, and serum metabolic profiles of the study population were obtained from structured databases of the MENA cohorts. Habitual dietary intake was assessed using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. DNA methylation was measured in circulating white blood cells by microarray (Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChips). FDR values (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) were used to select those CpGs that showed the best correlation with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Pathway analyses involving the characterization of genes involved in the olfactory transduction system were performed using KEGG and pathDIP reference databases.Overall, 15 CpG sites at olfactory pathway genes were associated with BMI (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and WC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) after adjustments for potential confounding factors. Together, methylation levels at the15 CpG sites accounted for 22% and 20% of the variability in BMI and WC (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.219, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, and <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.204, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). These genes encompassed olfactory receptors (<i>OR4D2</i>, <i>OR51A7</i>, <i>OR2T34</i>, and <i>OR2Y1</i>) and several downstream signaling molecules (<i>SLC8A1</i>, <i>ANO2</i>, <i>PDE2A</i>, <i>CALML3</i>, <i>GNG7</i>, <i>CALML6</i>, <i>PRKG1</i>, and <i>CAMK2D</i>), which significantly regulated odor detection and signal transduction processes within the complete olfactory cascade, as revealed by pathway enrichment analyses (<i>p</i> = 1.94 × 10<sup>-10</sup>). Moreover, <i>OR4D2</i> and <i>OR2Y1</i> gene methylation patterns strongly correlated with daily intakes of total energy (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), carbohydrates (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), protein (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and fat (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).The results of this study suggest novel relationships between olfactory pathway gene methylation signatures, obesity indices, and dietary intakes."	"Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have identified several causative genes for hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAADs), including Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and familial non-syndromic TAADs. Syndromic TAADs are typically caused by pathogenic variants in the transforming growth factor-β signal and extracellular matrix-related genes (e.g. FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, and COL3A1). On the other hand, approximately 20% of the non-syndromic hereditary TAADs result from altered components of the contractile apparatus of vascular smooth muscle cells, which are encoded by ACTA2, MYH11, MYLK, and PRKG1 genes; however, the remaining 80% cannot be explained by previously reported candidate genes. Moreover, the relationship between the genotype and phenotype of TAADs has extensively been reported to investigate better methods for risk stratification and further personalized treatment strategies. With regard to MFS-causing FBN1, recent reports have shown significantly increased risk of aortic events in patients carrying a truncating variant or a variant exhibiting a haploinsufficient-type effect, typically comprising nonsense or small insertions/deletions resulting in out-of-frame effects, compared to those carrying a variant with dominant negative-type effect, typically comprising missense variants. Therefore, cardiologists are required to have sufficient knowledge regarding the genetics of hereditary TAADs for providing the best clinical management, with an appropriate genetic counseling. In the current review, we present current advances in the genetics of hereditary TAADs and discuss the benefits and limitations with respect to the use of this genetic understanding in clinical settings."	"The c.530G&gt;A (p.Arg177Gln) mutation in PRKG1 has been shown to be associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. This rare mutation accounts for an estimated 1% of nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease. We sought to describe the clinical presentation of type B aortic dissection (TBAD), management, and outcomes in patients with this mutation.This is a descriptive multi-institutional retrospective study of patients from six families with the PRKG1 mutation. Patients with TBAD were selected for analysis. Demographics, family histories, TBAD management, and outcomes were reviewed.Of the 29 individuals diagnosed with the PRKG1 mutation, 12 (41.3%) had TBAD (50% male, TBAD median age: 31 years [range, 16-58 years], median follow-up: 6 years [range, 3-15 years] after TBAD). All had a family history of aortic dissections and none had features of Marfan syndrome. The median size of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) at TBAD was 4.1 cm (range, 3.8-5 cm). Most cases (9 acute TBAD, 1 incidental TBAD diagnosis during screening) were managed medically. One case had open DTA repair the acute phase. Repair for dissection-related aneurysmal degeneration was performed in seven cases (58.3%) in the chronic phase at a median of 2 years (range, 1-8 years) after TBAD. In four cases (33.3%), the DTA remained stable in size over a range of 1 to 7 years after TBAD. Type A aortic dissection subsequent to TBAD occurred in three cases (25%). There were four (33.3%) deaths in the series, all aortic related at a median age of 24 years (range, 19-43 years).The PRKG1 (p.Arg177Gln) mutation although rare is associated with nonsyndromic TBAD in young and middle-aged patients. Workup for this gene mutation should be included as part of the workup for TBAD etiology in relatively young patients and those with familial history of aortic dissections. Once diagnosed, testing of first-degree family members is warranted. In all individuals with a PRKG1 mutation, close follow-up for aortic root dilatation and hypertension control is essential to reduce the risk of type A or type B aortic dissection, and in cases of TBAD, to decrease the risk of dissection-related aneurysmal degeneration."	"Foraging is a goal-directed behavior that balances the need to explore the environment for resources with the need to exploit those resources. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, distinct phenotypes have been observed in relation to the <i>foraging</i> gene (<i>for</i>), labeled the rover and sitter. Adult rovers explore their environs more extensively than do adult sitters. We explored whether this distinction would be conserved in humans. We made use of a distinction from regulatory mode theory between those who &quot;get on with it,&quot; so-called locomotors, and those who prefer to ensure they &quot;do the right thing,&quot; so-called assessors. In this logic, rovers and locomotors share similarities in goal pursuit, as do sitters and assessors. We showed that genetic variation in <i>PRKG1</i>, the human ortholog of <i>for</i>, is associated with preferential adoption of a specific regulatory mode. Next, participants performed a foraging task to see whether genetic differences associated with distinct regulatory modes would be associated with distinct goal pursuit patterns. Assessors tended to hug the boundary of the foraging environment, much like behaviors seen in <i>Drosophila</i> adult sitters. In a patchy foraging environment, assessors adopted more cautious search strategies maximizing exploitation. These results show that distinct patterns of goal pursuit are associated with particular genotypes of <i>PRKG1</i>, the human ortholog of <i>for</i>."	"Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a common condition associated with high mortality. It is predominantly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance and variable expression. The genetic basis of the majority of TAAD cases remains unknown.We described a 53 years old male presented with abdominal aortic dissection as well as aortic tortuosity. To investigate the genetic basis of the clinical presentation, whole-exome sequencing was performed. Exome sequencing identified a de novo heterozygous undescribed mutation in the PRKG1 gene (NM_001098512.2: c.1108 G &gt; A), predicted to cause the missense change p.Gly370Ser in the ATP binding motif of the protein. This mutation was not reported in the dbSNP, 1000 Genome Project, and Exome sequencing databases. Furthermore, the Glycine370 residue of PRKG1 is highly conserved among various species and it is predicted to be damaging by multiple in silico programs, suggesting that this substitution may cause a major disruption of protein function. To our knowledge, this is the second reported mutation locus of PRKG1 accounting for the disease.Our study expands the mutation spectrum of PRKG1 and clinical phenotype of mutation-carriers. Screening for PRKG1 mutations should be considered in patients with unexplained aortic disease, and identification of the causative gene will aid in individualized, gene-tailored management."	NA	NA
"SMAD3"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Int J Mol Med 41: [Related article:] 1030‑1038, 2018; DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2017.3268. An interested reader drew to our attention the fact that the western blots featured in Fig. 2B in the above article contained duplicated data: The data shown for the TGF‑β and vimentin protein bands were apparently identical; furthermore, there was a strong likelihood that the protein bands featured for the ZO‑1 and SMAD‑3 experiments were also the same, but flipped horizontally relative to the other. Following an investigation, the Journal was able to confirm that this duplication of the research data had probably occurred. On those grounds, the Editor of International Journal of Molecular Medicine has decided that the above paper should be retracted. We were unable to make contact with the authors of the article published in International Journal of Molecular Medicine, despite every effort to do so. The Editor deeply regrets any inconvenience that this retraction has caused to the the readership of the Journal."	"Intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) represent one of the most common diseases in women of reproductive age. Patients with moderate‑to‑severe IUA can experience a decrease in normal menstrual patterns, amenorrhea and even infertility. At present, the first‑line treatment strategies for IUAs in the clinical practice are hysteroscopic transuterine resection of adhesion and postoperative adjuvant therapy, including oestrogen. However, a high recurrence rate of IUAs remains. In recent years, studies have demonstrated that aspirin combined with oestrogen may significantly prevent the postoperative disease recurrence rate, improve endometrial receptivity and improve the conception rate by increasing endometrial blood supply and angiogenesis more effectively. The TGF‑β1‑Smad2/Smad3 pathway is one of the important mechanisms involved in endometrial fibrosis. However, whether aspirin can inhibit endometrial fibrosis through the TGF‑β1‑Smad2/Smad3 pathway to prevent postoperative re‑adhesion remains to be elucidated. The results of the present study suggested that aspirin inhibits endometrial fibrosis by suppressing the TGF‑β1‑Smad2/Smad3 pathway, which may provide new hypotheses for the mechanism of action of aspirin in the treatment of IUAs."	"Phosphorus is an essential mineral for all living organisms and a limited resource worldwide. Variation and heritability of phosphorus utilization (PU) traits were observed, indicating the general possibility of improvement. Molecular mechanisms of PU, including host and microbial effects, are still poorly understood. The most promising molecules that interact between the microbiome and host are microRNAs. Japanese quail representing extremes for PU were selected from an F2 population for miRNA profiling of the ileal tissue and subsequent association with mRNA and microbial data of the same animals. Sixty-nine differentially expressed miRNAs were found, including 21 novel and 48 known miRNAs. Combining miRNAs and mRNAs based on correlated expression and target prediction revealed enrichment of transcripts in functional pathways involved in phosphate or bone metabolism such as RAN, estrogen receptor and Wnt signaling, and immune pathways. Out of 55 genera of microbiota, seven were found to be differentially abundant between PU groups. The study reveals molecular interactions occurring in the gut of quail which represent extremes for PU including miRNA-16-5p, miR-142b-5p, miR-148a-3p, <i>CTDSP1</i>, <i>SMAD3</i>, <i>IGSF10</i>, Bacteroides, and Alistipes as key indicators due to their trait-dependent differential expression and occurrence as hub-members of the network of molecular drivers of PU."	"The carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) lattice laser has been successfully used to treat facial skin photoaging induced by UV light. In this study, we analyzed the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> lattice laser irradiation on skin photoaging, and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the laser promoted collagen synthesis and proliferation of primary human skin fibroblasts, inhibited cell senescence, and induced expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the signaling protein SMAD3. In addition, this laser reversed cell cycle arrest and fibroblast apoptosis induced by UVB irradiation, and restored fibroblast proliferation inhibited by SMAD3 silencing. Using a rat model of photoaging, our results show that the laser increased collagen expression and dermal thickness, demonstrating that the CO<sub>2</sub> lattice laser has a profound therapeutic effect on photoaged skin. Together, our <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data show that the CO<sub>2</sub> lattice laser can reverse the skin aging caused by UVB, and indicate that this effect is mediated through SMAD3."	"Although emerging studies have provided evidence that osteocytes are actively involved in fracture healing, there is a general lack of a detailed understanding of the mechanistic pathway, cellular events and expression of markers at different phases of healing.This systematic review describes the role of osteocytes in fracture healing from early to late phase. Literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase. Original animal and clinical studies with available English full-text were included. Information was retrieved from the selected studies.A total of 23 articles were selected in this systematic review. Most of the studies investigated changes of various genes and proteins expression patterns related to osteocytes. Several studies have described a constant expression of osteocyte-specific marker genes throughout the fracture healing cascade followed by decline phase with the progress of healing, denoting the important physiological role of the osteocyte and the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network in fracture healing. The reports of various markers suggested that osteocytes could trigger coordinated bone healing responses from cell death and expression of proinflammatory markers cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin 6 at early phase of fracture healing. This is followed by the expression of growth factors bone morphogenetic protein-2 and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 that matched with the neo-angiogenesis, chondrogenesis and callus formation during the intermediate phase. Tightly controlled regulation of osteocyte-specific markers E11/Podoplanin (E11), dentin matrix protein 1 and sclerostin modulate and promote osteogenesis, mineralisation and remodelling across different phases of fracture healing. Stabilised fixation was associated with the finding of higher number of osteocytes with little detectable bone morphogenetic proteins expressions in osteocytes. Sclerostin-antibody treatment was found to result in improvement in bone mass, bone strength and mineralisation.To further illustrate the function of osteocytes, additional longitudinal studies with appropriate clinically relevant model to study osteoporotic fractures are crucial. Future investigations on the morphological changes of osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network during healing, osteocyte-mediated signalling molecules in the transforming growth factor-beta-Smad3 pathway, perilacunar remodelling, type of fixation and putative biomarkers to monitor fracture healing are highly desirable to bridge the current gaps of knowledge.The translational potential of this article: This systematic review provides an up-to-date chronological overview and highlights the osteocyte-regulated events at gene, protein, cellular and tissue levels throughout the fracture healing cascade, with the hope of informing and developing potential new therapeutic strategies that could improve the timing and quality of fracture healing in the future."	"Background Vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic change and consequential intimal hyperplasia (IH) cause arterial stenosis and posttreatment restenosis. Smad3 is a master transcription factor, yet its underlying functional mechanisms in this disease context are not well defined. Methods and Results In cultured smooth muscle cells, Smad3 silencing and overexpression respectively reduced and increased the mRNA and protein of NRP2 (neuropilin 2), a recently reported pro-IH signaling factor. Smad3 silencing attenuated pro-IH smooth muscle cell phenotypes including proliferation, migration, and dedifferentiation (reduced smooth muscle α-actin). While increased Smad3 enhanced these phenotypes, NRP2 silencing abolished this enhancement. Interestingly, the 5' untranslated region but not the promoter of NRP2 was indispensable for Smad3-enhanced transcriptional activity (luciferase assay); both chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed predominant Smad3 binding in the +51 to +78 bp region of NRP2's 5' untranslated region. In vivo, Smad3 haploinsufficiency reduced NRP2 (immunostaining) and IH (by 47%) in wire-injured mouse femoral arteries. Conclusions Smad3 controls NRP2 expression by occupying its 5' untranslated region in promoting smooth muscle cell phenotypic change in vitro. This and in vivo results shed new light on the long-debated role of Smad3 in IH."	"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that is manifested clinically by an elevation in hepatic triglycerides, inflammation, and fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH remains incompletely understood. Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, has been implicated in the fatty liver disease; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms in the NASH pathogenesis are elusive. The aims of this study were to elucidate the role of hepatic Sirt6 in NASH.Wild-type (WT), liver-specific Sirt6 knockout (KO), hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-specific Sirt6 knockout (HSC-KO), and Sirt6 transgenic (Tg) mice were subjected to a Western diet for 4 weeks. Hepatic phenotypes were characterized and underlying mechanisms were investigated.Remarkably, both the liver-KO and HSC-KO mice developed much worse NASH than the WT mice did whereas the Tg mice were protected from the diet-induced NASH. Our cell signaling analysis revealed that Sirt6 negatively regulates the TGFβ-Smad3 pathway. Biochemical analysis showed a physical interaction between Sirt6 and Smad3 in hepatic stellate cells. Moreover, our molecular data further demonstrated that Sirt6 deacetylates Smad3 at key lysine residues K333 and K378 and attenuates its transcriptional activity induced by TGFβ in the hepatic stellate cells.Our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a critical role in the protection against the NASH development and it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for NASH."	"Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) show great potential as the therapeutic targets attributing to their implication in the progression of various human cancers, including ovarian cancer (OC). Here, we aimed to explore the biological function of lncRNA cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B antisense RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1) in OC and its mechanism of action. The abundances of CDKN2B-AS1, miR-143-3p, and SMAD3 mRNA were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) was performed to analyze cell proliferation. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and western blot analyses. Trans-well assay was utilized to analyze cell migration and invasion abilities. Tumor xenograft was performed to confirm the role of CDKN2B-AS1 in ovarian tumor growth in vivo. The protein level of SMAD3 was examined by western blot assay. The interaction between CDKN2B-AS1 and miR-143-3p, or miR-143-3p and SMAD3 was demonstrated by bioinformatic, luciferase reporter, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. CDKN2B-AS1 was upregulated in OC and correlated with clinicopathologic features. The knockdown of CDKN2B-AS1 hampered the development of OC, as reflected by the suppression of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the enhancement of cell apoptosis, whereas the effects could be rescued by the overexpression of SMAD3. The absence of CDKN2B-AS1 blocked tumor growth in vivo. CDKN2B-AS1 served as a molecular sponge for miR-143-3p, leading to the derepression of miR-143-3p target SMAD3, which eventually triggered the progression of OC. In conclusion, CDKN2B-AS1 promoted tumor growth, invasion, and migration of OC by regulation of miR-143-3p/SMAD3 axis, hinting that CDKN2B-AS1 might be a potential biomarker for OC diagnosis and treatment."	"TGFβ induces the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts but underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Because endocytosis of TGFβ receptor II (TβRII), in response to TGFβ stimulation, is a prerequisite for TGF signaling, we investigated the role of protein diaphanous homolog 1 (known as Diaph1 or mDia1) for the myofibroblastic activation of HSCs. Using shRNA to knockdown Diaph1 or SMIFH2 to target Diaph1 activity of HSCs, we found that the inactivation of Diaph1 blocked internalization and intracellular trafficking of TβRII and reduced SMAD3 phosphorylation induced by TGFβ1. Mechanistic studies revealed that the N-terminal portion of Diaph1 interacted with both TβRII and Rab5a directly and that Rab5a activity of HSCs was increased by Diaph1 overexpression and decreased by Diaph1 knockdown. Additionally, expression of Rab5aQ79L (active Rab5a mutant) increased whereas the expression of Rab5aS34N (inactive mutant) reduced the endosomal localization of TβRII in HSCs compared to the expression of wild-type Rab5a. Functionally, TGFβ stimulation promoted HSCs to express tumor-promoting factors, and α-smooth muscle actin, fibronection, and CTGF, markers of myofibroblastic activation of HSCs. Targeting Diaph1 or Rab5a suppressed HSC activation and limited tumor growth in a tumor implantation mouse model. Thus, Dipah1 and Rab5a represent targets for inhibiting HSC activation and the hepatic tumor microenvironment."	"Serum prolactin levels gradually increase from birth to puberty in both male and female rats, with higher levels observed in female since the first days of life. The increase in lactotroph secretion was attributed to the maturation of prolactin-inhibiting and -releasing factors; however, those mechanisms could not fully explain the gender differences observed. Prolactin secretion from isolated lactotrophs, in the absence of hypothalamic control, also increases during the first weeks of life suggesting the involvement of intra-pituitary factors. We postulate that pituitary transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) is involved in the regulation of prolactin secretion as well as in the gender differences observed at early postnatal age. Several components of the local TGFβ1 system were evaluated during postnatal development (11-, 23- and 45-days) in female and male Sprague Dawley rats. In vivo assays were performed to study local TGFβ1 activation and its impact on prolactin secretion. 11d female pituitaries present high levels of active TGFβ1, concomitant with the highest expression of TGFβ1 target genes and the phospho-Smad3 immunostaining in lactotrophs. The steady increase in prolactin secretion inversely correlates with active TGFβ1 levels only in females. Dopamine and estradiol induce TGFβ1 activation at 11d, in both genders, but its activation induces the inhibition of prolactin secretion only in females. Our findings demonstrate that: 1- TGFβ1 activation is regulated by dopamine and estradiol; 2- the inhibitory regulation of local TGFβ1 on prolactin secretion is gender-specific; and 3- this mechanism is responsible, at least partially, of the gender differences observed being relevant during postnatal development."	"Tumor progression and metastasis are the major causes of death among cancer associated mortality. Metastatic cells acquire features of migration and invasion and usually undergo epithelia-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Acquirement of these various hallmarks rely on different cellular pathways, including TGF-β and Wnt signaling. Recently, we reported that WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) acts as a tumor suppressor and has anti-metastatic activities involving regulation of several key microRNAs (miRNAs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we report that WWOX restoration in highly metastatic MDA-MB435S cancer cells alters mRNA expression profiles; further, WWOX interacts with various proteins to exert its tumor suppressor function. Careful alignment and analysis of gene and miRNA expression in these cells revealed profound changes in cellular pathways mediating adhesion, invasion and motility. We further demonstrate that WWOX, through regulation of miR-146a levels, regulates SMAD3, which is a member of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Moreover, proteomic analysis of WWOX partners revealed regulation of the Wnt-signaling activation through physical interaction with Disheveled. Altogether, these findings underscore a significant role for WWOX in antagonizing metastasis, further highlighting its role and therapeutic potential in suppressing tumor progression."	"Paeoniflorin, a prominent component in some Chinese formulas for hyperprolactinemia-associated disorders, has been found to inhibit prolactin secretion in prolactinoma cells.To examine the efficacy of paeoniflorin on hyperprolactinemia and the underlying mechanisms of action.Hyperprolactinemia in female rats was generated by administration of olanzapine (5 mg/kg, by a gavage method, once daily, × 13 weeks). The rats were co-treated with paeoniflorin (10 and 50 mg/kg). Prolactin and TGF-β1 concentrations were detected by ELISA. Protein expression was determined by Western blot. The effect in MMQ cells was also examined.Paeoniflorin inhibited olanzapine-induced increases in plasma prolactin concentration and prolactin protein overexpression in the pituitary and hypothalamus of rats. Further, paeoniflorin restored olanzapine-induced downregulation of pituitary and hypothalamic dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) protein expression. More importantly, paeoniflorin attenuated olanzapine-suppressed protein expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and its downstream genes, type II TGF-β receptor, type I TGF-β receptor and phosphorylated SMAD3 in the tissues. However, paeoniflorin did not affect plasma TGF-β1 concentration and hepatic TGF-β1 protein expression. In accord, olanzapine-induced increase in prolactin concentration, upregulation of prolactin protein expression, and downregulation of protein expression of the D2R and TGF-β1 signals in MMQ cells were attenuated.This study demonstrates that paeoniflorin ameliorates olanzapine-induced hyperprolactinemia in rats by attenuating impairment of the D2R and TGF-β1 signaling pathways in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Our findings may provide evidence to support the use of paeoniflorin-contained Chinese herbs and formulas for hyperprolactinemia and its associated disorders."	"In the current issue of JEM, Kang et al. (https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191499) describe somatic mutations in the SMAD3 gene causing endosteal melorheostosis. Using osteoblast models, the identified mutations are demonstrated to exert a gain-of-function mechanism, augmenting transforming growth factor (TGF) β signaling. These findings provide further insights into the genetic etiology of melorheostosis and consolidate the importance of the TGFβ pathway in skeletal disorders."	"Burn injury is common, and antimicrobial agents are often applied immediately to prevent wound infection and excessive inflammatory response. Although inflammation is essential for clearing bacteria and creating an environment conducive to the healing process, it is unclear what time-frame inflammation should be present for optimal wound healing. This study critically investigated the role of early inflammation in burn wound healing, and also revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-healing effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). We created a burn injury mouse model using wild-type and Smad3-/- mice, which were topically treated with AgNPs at different post-burn days, and examined the healing processes of the various groups. We also delineated the molecular pathways underlying the anti-inflammation and pro-healing effects of AgNPs by morphological and histological analysis, immuno-histochemistry, and western blotting. Our results showed that (1) AgNPs regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 production of keratinocytes and neutrophils infiltration through KGF-2/p38 signaling pathway, (2) Topical AgNPs treatment immediately after burn injury significantly supressed early inflammation but resulted in delayed healing, (3) A short delay in AgNPs application (post-burn day 3 in our model) allowed early inflammation in a controlled manner, and led to optimal burn wound healing. Thus, our current study showed that some degree of early inflammation was beneficial, but prolonged inflammation was detrimental for burn wound healing. Further evaluation and clinical translation of this finding is warranted."	"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to alleviate renal fibrosis, however, the role of individual HDAC isoforms in this process is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the role of HDAC8 in the development of renal fibrosis and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT). In a murine model of renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), HDAC8 was primarily expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells and time-dependently upregulated. This occurred in parallel with the deacetylation of cortactin, a nonhistone substrate of HDAC8, and increased expression of three fibrotic markers: α-smooth muscle actin, collagen 1, and fibronectin. Administration of PCI34051, a highly selective inhibitor of HDAC8, restored acetylation of contactin and reduced expression of those proteins. PCI34051 treatment also reduced the number of renal tubular epithelial cells arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and suppressed phosphorylation of Smad3, STAT3, β-catenin, and expression of Snail after ureteral obstruction. In contrast, HDAC8 inhibition reversed UUO-induced downregulation of BMP7 and Klotho, two renoprotective proteins. In cultured murine proximal tubular cells, treatment with PCI34051 or specific HDAC8 siRNA was also effective in inhibiting transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)-induced deacetylation of contactin, EMT, phosphorylation of Smad3, STAT3, and β-catenin, upregulation of Snail, and downregulation of BMP7 and Klotho. Collectively, these results suggest that HDAC8 activation is required for the EMT and renal fibrogenesis by activation of multiple profibrotic signaling and transcription factors, and suppression of antifibrotic proteins. Therefore, targeting HDAC8 may be novel therapeutic approach for treatment of renal fibrosis."	"This study evaluates the possible protective effects of gallic acid (GaA) and ferulic acid (FeA) against an experimentally induced liver fibrosis by thioacetamide (TAA) in rats. Animals were divided into: Control group, GaA group (20 mg/kg/day, p.o), FeA (20 mg/kg/day, p.o), TAA group (receiving 250 mg/kg twice/week, I.P), TAA + GaA group, TAA + FeA group (received the same previous doses) and TAA+silymarin group (received silymarin at 100 mg/kg/day+TAA as mentioned above). After 6 consecutive weeks, animals were sacrificed and the assessment of liver functions, oxidative stress biomarkers and histopathological examination of the liver tissues were performed. In addition, the effect on TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling and the expression of miR-21, miR-30 and miR-200 were evaluated. The results showed that administration of GaA or FeA with TAA induced a significant reduction in serum ALT, AST and ALP activities and protected the integrity of liver tissues. Furthermore, they increased the activities of the hepatic antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase and catalase while decreased malondialdehyde content to a normal level. The hepatic expression of TGF-β1, phosphorylated and total Smad3 proteins were significantly decreased. In addition, miR-21 expression was downregulated while miR-30 and miR-200 expressions were upregulated by administration of gallic acid or ferulic acid. In conclusion, gallic and ferulic acids exhibit hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects against TAA-induced liver fibrosis in rats. These effects are mediated through inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling and differentially regulating the hepatic expression level of miR-21, miR-30 and miR-200."	"Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), characterized predominantly by erythema, vesiculation, and pruritus, is a T cell-mediated skin inflammatory condition. Among immune cells involved in ACD, mast cells (MCs) play an essential role in its pathogenesis. As an inhibitor of proinflammatory IL-1 family members, interleukin 37 (IL-37) has been shown to ameliorate inflammatory responses in various allergic diseases. In this study, we assessed the immunomodulatory effect of IL-37 on allergic inflammation using a 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced ACD rat model and isolated rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs). Systematic application of IL-37 significantly relieved ear swelling, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-13), inhibited MC recruitment, lowered IgE levels, and reduced IL-33 production in the local ear tissues with DNFB challenge. Additionally, RPMCs isolated from ACD rats with IL-37 intervention showed downregulation of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-13, and MCP-1 production following IL-33 stimulation, and reduction of β-hexosaminidase and histamine release under DNP-IgE/HSA treatment. Moreover, IL-37 treatment also significantly restrained NF-κB activation and P38 phosphorylation in ACD RPMCs. SIS3, a specific Smad3 inhibitor, abolished the suppressive effects of IL-37 on MC-mediated allergic inflammation, suggesting the participation of Smad3 in the anti-ACD effect of IL-37. These findings indicated that IL-37 protects against IL-33-regulated MC inflammatory responses via inhibition of NF-κB and P38 MAPK activation accompanying the regulation of Smad3 in rats with ACD."	"Emerging evidence shows that the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is involved in fibrosis in many organs. However, its role in diabetic cardiac fibrosis remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the expression level of TRPV4 in the diabetic heart and clarify its role in diabetes-induced cardiac fibrosis. A diabetic animal model was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin into Sprague-Dawley rats. We also investigated cardiac fibroblasts isolated from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats. TRPV4 expression was significantly upregulated in both diabetic myocardium and cardiac fibroblasts cultured in high-glucose medium. Masson's trichrome staining revealed that the TRPV4 antagonist HC067047 attenuated the diabetes-induced cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, HC067047 reduced collagen Ι synthesis and suppressed the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) level as well as the phosphorylation of Smad3 in the diabetic heart. In addition, the TRPV4 antagonist inhibited the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, collagen Ι synthesis, and activation of the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway induced by high-glucose culture medium. Our findings demonstrate that the upregulation of TRPV4 expression mediates diabetic cardiac fibrosis via activation of the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway."	"Patients with the Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) have mutations in the TGF-<i>β</i>R1, TGF-<i>β</i>R2, and SMAD3 genes. However, little is known about the redox homeostasis in the thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) they develop. Here, we evaluate the oxidant/antioxidant profile in the TAA tissue from LDS patients and compare it with that in nondamaged aortic tissue from control (C) subjects. We evaluate the enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms, and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). We also analyze some antioxidants from a nonenzymatic system such as selenium (Se), glutathione (GSH), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Oxidative stress markers such as lipid peroxidation and carbonylation, as well as xanthine oxidase (ORX) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expressions, were also evaluated. TAA from LDS patients showed a decrease in GSH, Se, TAC, GPx, GST, CAT, and TrxR. The SOD activity and ORX expressions were increased, but the Nrf2 expression was decreased. The results suggest that the redox homeostasis is altered in the TAA from LDS patients, favoring ROS overproduction that contributes to the decrease in GSH and TAC and leads to LPO and carbonylation. The decrease in Se and Nrf2 alters the activity and/or expression of some antioxidant enzymes, thus favoring a positive feedback oxidative background that contributes to the TAA formation."	"As one of the most widely produced engineered nanomaterials, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO<sub>2</sub>) are used in biomedicine and healthcare products, and as implant scaffolds; therefore, the toxic mechanism of nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> has been extensively investigated with a view to guiding application. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models can simplify the complex physiological environment and mimic the in vivo architecture of tissues, which is optimal for the assessment of nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> toxicity under ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation.In the present study, the toxicity of nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> under UVA irradiation was investigated in 3D H22 spheroids cultured in fibrin gels. A significant reduction of approximately 25% in spheroid diameter was observed following treatment with 100 μg/mL nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> under UVA irradiation after seven days of culture. Nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> under UVA irradiation triggered the initiation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, increasing the expression levels of TGF-β1, Smad3, Cdkn1a, and Cdkn2b at both the mRNA and protein level, which resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In addition, nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> under UVA irradiation also triggered the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were shown to be involved in cell cycle regulation and the induction of TGF-β1 expression.Nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> under UVA irradiation induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and the formation of smaller spheroids, which were associated with TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway activation and ROS generation. These results reveal the toxic mechanism of nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> under UVA irradiation, providing the possibility for 3D spheroid models to be used in nanotoxicology studies."
"TGFB2"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"The formation and development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is accompanied by inflammation and fibrosis. Existing treatments are expensive and can cause irreversible complications. Pirfenidone (PFD) exerts anti‑inflammatory and anti‑fibrotic effects; however, its applications in the eye remain unclear. Male C57BL/6J mice (aged 6‑8 weeks) were used to explore whether PFD can inhibit the formation of laser‑induced CNV. The localization of transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2) was determined through immunofluorescent staining. After laser photocoagulation, the vehicle and PFD groups were intravitreally injected with 1 µl PBS and 1 µl 0.5% PFD, respectively. At day 7 after intravitreal injection, the expression of TGFβ2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed. Fundus fluorescein angiography was performed to investigate the extent of fluorescence leakage, and the CNV areas were analyzed using a choroidal flat mount. The results demonstrated that, on day 7 after photocoagulation, the expression of TGFβ2 and VEGF was reduced in the experimental group. In addition, fluorescein angiography showed that the leakage area of CNV was significantly smaller in the PFD injection group than those observed in the control and vehicle groups. Moreover, the areas of CNV in the PFD injection group were smaller compared with those reported in the other two injection groups. Histopathological and TUNEL analyses performed on day 28 revealed that there were no notable abnormalities on the layers of the neural retina of PFD‑treated mice. In conclusion, intravitreal injection of PFD inhibited the formation of CNV in mice, likely via the downregulation of VEGF and TGFβ2, which did not cause damage to the mouse retina after 28 days of treatment."	"Osteosarcoma metastasizes to the lung, and there is a link between the predominance of tumor-promoting immunosuppressive M2 macrophages in the metastases and poor patient survival. By contrast, M1 macrophage predominance correlates with longer survival. M2 macrophages can be induced by various stimuli in the tumor microenvironment, including exosomes, which are 40- to 150-nm vesicles that are involved in intercellular communication and contribute to tumor progression and immune evasion. Recognizing that tumor cells can influence the tumor microenvironment to make it more permissive and because of the link between M2 dominance and curtailed patient survival, we evaluated the effect of exosomes from non-metastatic K7 and Dunn osteosarcoma cells and the metastatic sublines K7M3 and DLM8 on macrophage phenotype and function. Incubating MHS mouse alveolar macrophages with K7M3 and DLM8 exosomes induced expression of IL10, TGFB2, and CCL22 mRNA (markers of M2 macrophages) and decreased phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing. In contrast, exosomes from non-metastatic K7 or Dunn cells did not inhibit phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity or induce increased expression of IL10, TGFB2 or CCL22 mRNA. In addition, metastatic osteosarcoma cell exosomes significantly increased the secretion of TGFB2, a key signaling pathway associated with tumor- mediated immune suppression. Finally, the inhibition of TGFB2 reversed the suppressive activity of alveolar macrophages exposed to metastatic osteosarcoma cell exosomes. Our data suggest that the exosomes from metastatic osteosarcoma cells can modulate cellular signaling of tumor-associated macrophages, thereby promoting the M2 phenotype and creating an immunosuppressive, tumor-promoting microenvironment through the production of TGFB2."	"Human genome-wide association studies and animal models suggest a role for TGFB2 in contributing to the corneal thickness phenotype. No specific mutations, however, have been reported in this gene that affect corneal thickness. We sought to determine if haploinsufficiency of TGFB2 in humans associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 4 is associated with corneal thinning.Observational cohort study of families with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 4, caused specifically by TGFB2 mutations, in a tertiary care setting.Three probands with pathogenic mutations in TGFB2 and family members underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination.Clinical assessment included Scheimpflug imaging, specular microscopy, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. We measured visual acuity, axial length, refractive error, and central corneal thickness.Clinical evaluation of 2 probands identified corneal thinning and cornea guttata, despite a young age and distinct mutations in TGFB2 (c.905G&gt;A, p.Arg302His; c.988C&gt;A, p.Arg330Ser). In the third family, corneal thinning co-segregated with a TGFB2 mutation (c.1103G&gt;A, p.Gly368Glu), although without apparent guttae.In this series, participants with TGFB2 mutations associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 4 demonstrated decreased corneal thickness, and in 2 cases with splice site mutations, also demonstrated cornea guttata. The data demonstrate the importance of considering distinct phenotype-genotype correlations within this condition."	"β-Carbolines (BC) are pyridoindoles, which can be found in various exogenous and endogenous sources. Recent studies revealed neurostimulative, neuroprotective, neuroregenerative and anti-inflammatory effects of 9-methyl-BC (9-Me-BC). Additionally, 9-me-BC increased neurite outgrowth of dopaminergic neurons independent of dopamine uptake into these neurons. In this study, the role of astrocytes in neurostimulative, neuroregenerative and neuroprotective properties of 9-me-BC was further explored.9-Me-BC exerted anti-proliferative effects without toxic properties in dopaminergic midbrain and cortical astrocyte cultures. The organic cation transporter (OCT) but not the dopamine transporter seem to mediate at least part the effect of 9-me-BC on astrocytes. Remarkably, 9-me-BC stimulated the gene expression of several important neurotrophic factors for dopaminergic neurons like Artn, Bdnf, Egln1, Tgfb2 and Ncam1. These factors are well known to stimulate neurite outgrowth and to show neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties to dopaminergic neurons against various toxins. Further, we show that effect of 9-me-BC is mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Additionally, 9-me-BC showed inhibitory properties to monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity with an IC50 value of 1 µM for MAO-A and of 15.5 µM for MAO-B. The inhibition of MAO by 9-me-BC might contribute to the observed increased dopamine content and anti-apoptotic properties in cell culture after 9-me-BC treatment in recent studies. Thus, 9-me-BC have a plethora of beneficial effects on dopaminergic neurons warranting its exploration as a new multimodal anti-parkinsonian medication."	"Background： Excessive scarring of filtering blebs is the main cause of surgical failure in glaucoma. Previous studies have highlighted the role of chloride channels in scar formation , whereas the role of chloride channels in scarring of filtering blebs has not been studied.To investigate the effects of the ClC-2 chloride channel on scar formation of filtering blebs after glaucoma filtering surgery.ClC-2 siRNA-transfected Human conjunctival fibroblasts (HconFs) were cultured in type I collagen gels in the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Collagen gel contraction was evaluated based on the gel area. 3D-cultured HConFs were treated with the chloride channel blocker NPPB in the presence of TGF-β1, and cell proliferation collagen synthesis and contractility were measured. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in HConFs were assessed by western blotting and q-PCR.TGF-β1induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, collagen synthesis, and collagen gel contraction in HConFs. TGF-β1 increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels but inhibited the expression of TIMPs. NPPB and ClC-2 siRNA transfection inhibited TGF-β2-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, collagen synthesis, and collagen gel contraction, mediated by HConFs. TGF-β2-induced increases in MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also inhibited by NPPB and ClC-2 siRNA transfection, but TIMP expression was increased by NPPB and ClC-2 siRNA transfection.These findings demonstrate that ClC-2 chloride channels modulate TGF-β1-induced cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, and collagen gel contraction of HConFs by attenuating MMP-2 and MMP-9 production and by stimulating TIMP-1 production. NPPB may therefore prove to be of clinical value for the inhibition of scar formation of filtering blebs."	"To understand the functions of secretory proteins in odontogenesis and to further the understanding of the different molecular events during odontogenesis and osteogenesis, we induced the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of stem cells from dental apical papilla (SCAPs) and bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) <i>in vitro</i> and compared the expression of secretory proteins during early odonto/osteogenic differentiation using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The results revealed significant changes by at least 50% in 139 SCAP proteins and 203 BMSC proteins during differentiation. Of these, 92 were significantly upregulated and 47 were significantly downregulated during the differentiation of SCAPs. Most of these proteins showed the same trend during the differentiation of BMSCs. Among the proteins that showed significantly changes during the differentiation of SCAPs and BMSCs, we found that transforming growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) is a key protein in the network with powerful mediation ability. TGFβ2 was secreted more by SCAPs than BMSCs, was significantly upregulated during the differentiation of SCAPs and was significantly downregulated during the differentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, the effects of recombinant human TGFβ2 and TGFβ1 on the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of SCAPs and BMSCs were investigated. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting data revealed that TGFβ2 enhanced the odontogenic-related markers [dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)] and inhibited the osteogenic-related marker bone sialoprotein (BSP) in SCAPs, whereas TGFβ1 enhanced the BSP expression and inhibited the DSPP and DMP1 expression at early odonto/osteogenic differentiation of SCAPs. However, in BMSCs, TGFβ2 enhanced the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), DSPP, and DMP1, whereas TGFβ1 enhanced the expression of ALP and RUNX2, with no significant intergroup difference of DSPP at the early odonto/osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. TGFβ2 is a potentially important molecule with a distinct function in the regulation of odontogenesis and osteogenesis."	"The friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli-1) gene is involved in the expression control of key genes in multiple pathogenic/physiological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis; this implies that Fli-1 is a strong candidate for drug development. In our previous study, a 3',5'-diprenylated chalcone, (E)-1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,5-diprenyl) phenyl-3-(3-pyridinyl)-propene-1-one (<b>C10</b>), was identified as a novel anti-prostate cancer (PCa) agent. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of <b>C10</b> on the growth, metastasis, and invasion of PC3 cells in vitro. Our results show that <b>C10</b> exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on proliferation and metastasis of PC3 cells via several cellular and flow cytometric analyses. Further mechanism studies revealed that <b>C10</b> likely serves as an Fli-1 agonist for regulating the expression of Fli-1 target genes including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<i>P110</i>), murine double minute2 (<i>MDM2</i>), B-cell lymphoma-2 (<i>Bcl-2</i>), Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (<i>SHIP-1</i>), and globin transcription factor-1 (<i>Gata-1</i>) as well as the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1 (<i>ERK1</i>). Further, we confirmed that C10 can regulate the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (<i>VEGF-1</i>), transforming growth factor-β2 (<i>TGF-β2</i>), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (<i>ICAM-1</i>), p53, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (<i>MMP-1</i>) genes associated with tumor apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Thus, <b>C10</b> exhibits stronger anticancer activity with novel molecular targets and regulatory molecular mechanisms, indicating its great potency for development as a novel targeted anticancer drug."	"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the leading cause of visual impairment in the aging population. The goal of this study was to identify aberrantly-methylated, differentially-expressed genes (MDEGs) in AMD and explore the involved pathways via integrated bioinformatics analysis.Data from expression profile GSE29801 and methylation profile GSE102952 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We analyzed differentially-methylated genes and differentially-expressed genes using R software. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed using the R package and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes online database. Hub genes were identified using Cytoscape.In total, 827 and 592 genes showed high and low expression, respectively, in GSE29801; 4117 hyper-methylated genes and 511 hypo-methylated genes were detected in GSE102952. Based on overlap, we categorized 153 genes as hyper-methylated, low-expression genes (Hyper-LGs) and 24 genes as hypo-methylated, high-expression genes (Hypo-HGs). Four Hyper-LGs (CKB, PPP3CA, TGFB2, SOCS2) overlapped with AMD risk genes in the Public Health Genomics and Precision Health Knowledge Base. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that Hypo-HGs were enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, whereas Hyper-LGs were enriched in sphingolipid metabolism. In GO analysis, Hypo-HGs were enriched in fibroblast migration, membrane raft, and coenzyme binding, among others. Hyper-LGs were enriched in mRNA transport, nuclear speck, and DNA binding, among others. In PPI network analysis, 23 nodes and two edges were established from Hypo-HGs, and 151 nodes and 73 edges were established from Hyper-LGs. Hub genes (DHX9, MAPT, PAX6) showed the greatest overlap.This study revealed potentially aberrantly MDEGs and pathways in AMD, which might improve the understanding of this disease."	"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a medium vessel vasculitis that affects young children. Despite extensive research over the last 50 years, the etiology of KD remains an enigma. Seasonal change in wind patterns was shown to have correlation with the epidemics of KD in Japan. Occurrence of disease in epidemiological clusters, seasonal variation, and a very low risk of recurrence suggest that KD is triggered by an infectious agent. The identification of oligoclonal IgA response in the affected tissues suggests an antigen-driven inflammation. The recent identification of a viral antigen in the cytoplasm of bronchial ciliated epithelium also favors infection as the main trigger for KD. Pointers that suggest a genetic basis of KD include a high disease prevalence in North-East Asian populations, a high risk among siblings, and familial occurrence of cases. Dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses are evident in the acute stages of KD. In addition to the coronary wall inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and impaired vascular remodeling contribute to the development of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) and thrombosis. Genetic aberrations in certain intracellular signaling pathways involving immune effector functions are found to be associated with increased susceptibility to KD and development of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). Several susceptible genes have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and linkage studies (GWLS). The genes that are studied in KD can be classified under 4 major groups-enhanced T cell activation (ITPKC, ORAI1, STIM1), dysregulated B cell signaling (CD40, BLK, FCGR2A), decreased apoptosis (CASP3), and altered transforming growth factor beta signaling (TGFB2, TGFBR2, MMP, SMAD). The review aims to highlight the role of several genetic risk factors that are linked with the increased susceptibility to KD."	"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have displayed dysregulated expression in several types of cancer. However, the functions of the majority of circRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the expression, functions and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in PDAC. The circRNAs, mRNAs and the microRNA (miRNAs) expression profiles were obtained from three Gene Expression Omnibus microarray datasets, and a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA-hubgene network was established. The interactions between proteins were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database, and hubgenes were identified using the MCODE plugin. A total of eight differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs), 44 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and 2,052 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were identified. The present study successfully constructed a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on four circRNAs, six miRNAs and 111 mRNAs in PDAC. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways analyses indicated that DEmRNAs may participate in the pathogenesis and progression of PDAC. The protein-protein interaction network and module analysis identified six hubgenes (THBS1, FN1, TIMP3, TGFB2, ITGA1 and ITGA3). Furthermore, the circRNA-miRNA-hubgene regulatory modules were constructed based on the three DEcircRNAs, one DEmiRNAs and five DEmRNAs. In conclusion, the results of the present study improve the current understanding of the pathogenesis of PDAC."	"Recent studies have shown that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Our previous studies have reported that TAMs promote the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer (GC) cells through the Kindlin-2 pathway. However, the mechanism needs to be clarified.THP-1 monocytes were induced by PMA/interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 to establish an efficient TAM model <i>in vitro</i> and M2 macrophages were isolated via flow cytometry. A dual luciferase reporter system and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were used to investigate the mechanism of transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2) regulating Kindlin-2 expression. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the relationships among TAM infiltration in human GC tissues, Kindlin-2 protein expression, clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in human GC tissues. A nude mouse oncogenesis model was used to verify the invasion and metastasis mechanisms <i>in vivo</i>.We found that Kindlin-2 expression was upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in GC cells cocultured with TAMs, associated with higher invasion rate. Kindlin-2 knockdown reduced the invasion rate of GC cells under coculture condition. TGFβ2 secreted by TAMs regulated the expression of Kindlin-2 through the transcription factor NF-кB. TAMs thus participated in the progression of GC through the TGFβ2/NF-κB/Kindlin-2 axis. Kindlin-2 expression and TAM infiltration were significantly positively correlated with TNM stage, and patients with high Kindlin-2 expression had significantly poorer overall survival than patients with low Kindlin-2 expression. Furthermore, Kindlin-2 promoted the invasion of GC cells <i>in vivo</i>.This study elucidates the mechanism of TAMs participating in GC cell invasion and metastasis through the TGFβ2/NF-κB/Kindlin-2 axis, providing a possibility for new treatment options and approaches."	"Elevated levels of transforming-growth-factor (TGF)-β2 in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and aqueous humor are associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The underlying mechanism includes alteration of extracellular matrix homeostasis through Smad-dependent and independent signaling. Smad4, an essential co-Smad, upregulates hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis. Here, we explored whether TGF-β2 upregulates hepcidin, implicating iron in the pathogenesis of POAG.Primary human TM cells and human and bovine ex vivo anterior segment organ cultures were exposed to bioactive TGF-β2, hepcidin, heparin (a hepcidin antagonist), or N-acetyl carnosine (an antioxidant), and the change in the expression of hepcidin, ferroportin, ferritin, and TGF-β2 was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) was quantified with dihydroethidium, an ROS-sensitive dye.Primary human TM cells and bovine TM tissue synthesize hepcidin locally, which is upregulated by bioactive TGF-β2. Hepcidin downregulates ferroportin, its downstream target, increasing ferritin and iron-catalyzed ROS. This causes reciprocal upregulation of TGF-β2 at the transcriptional and translational levels. Heparin downregulates hepcidin, and reduces TGF-β2-mediated increase in ferritin and ROS. Notably, both heparin and N-acetyl carnosine reduce TGF-β2-mediated reciprocal upregulation of TGF-β2.The above observations suggest that TGF-β2 and hepcidin form a self-sustained feed-forward loop through iron-catalyzed ROS. This loop is partially disrupted by a hepcidin antagonist and an anti-oxidant, implicating iron and ROS in TGF-β2-mediated POAG. We propose that modification of currently available hepcidin antagonists for ocular use may prove beneficial for the therapeutic management of TGF-β2-associated POAG."	"Heat stress has a negative impact on dairy cow productivity. In order to reveal the mechanisms of heat-stress response, the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of five cows under chronic heat-stress and thermoneutral conditions were assayed in blood by high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 540 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs were expressed differently under heat-stress and thermoneutral conditions. Functional analyses revealed that MAPK signaling pathway, cellular senescence, circadian entrainment, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, and pathways in cancer were enriched for differently expressed mRNAs; meanwhile cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, thermogenesis, and protein digestion and absorption were enriched for differently expressed miRNAs. In addition, GADD45G, TGFB2, and GNG11 may play roles in the heat stress, and bta-miR-423-5p might be one of the regulators of heat-stress response in cows as potential mediators of chronic heat-stress response. In conclusion, the present study described the mRNA and miRNA expression patterns in blood extracted from cows during the transition from heat-stress to thermoneutral conditions. The results provide new data that could help in identifying mechanisms that mediate cows' response to chronic heat stress."	"Global DNA hydroxymethylation mediated by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme was induced in allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in mouse lung tissues and specifically in isolated airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. TET is an α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent enzyme, and the production of α-KG is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). However, the role of IDHs in the regulation of DNA hydroxymethylation in ASM cells is unknown. In comparison with non-asthmatic cells, asthmatic ASM cells exhibited a higher TET activity and IDH2 (not IDH-1 and -3) gene expression level. We modified the expression of IDH2 in ASM cells from human asthmatics by small interference RNA (siRNA), and the α-KG level, TET activity, global DNA hydroxymethylation, cell proliferation, and expression of ASM phenotypic genes were examined. Inhibition of IDH2 in asthmatic ASM cells decreased the α-KG level, TET activity, and global DNA hydroxymethylation and reversed the aberrant ASM phenotypes (including decreased cell proliferation and ASM phenotypic gene expression). Specifically, asthmatic cells transfected with siRNA against IDH2 (siIDH2) showed decreased 5hmC level at the transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2) promoter determined by oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq). Taken together, our findings revealed that IDH2 plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of ASM phenotypic changes in asthmatic ASM cells, suggesting that IDH2 is a potential therapeutic target for reversing the abnormal phenotypes seen in asthma."	"Fibroblast-like transformation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is a pathological feature of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) that may cause blindness. The effect of oxidative stress alone or together with transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2) on epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is not fully understood in RPE. TGF-β2 induced the upregulation EMT markers including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Snail, and Slug and downregulation of E-cadherin (E-cad) in ARPE-19 cells. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) not only upregulated α-SMA but also enhanced the effect of TGF-β2 on the expression of Snail and Slug. The CXCL family of cytokines could be the mediators of EMT induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and TGF-β2. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced CXCL1, that upregulated α-SMA and fibronectin. Both SB225002, an inhibitor of CXCR2, and antioxidant N-acetylcysteine suppressed the TGF-β2-induced EMT in ARPE-19 cells. Taken together, the results suggest that oxidative stress enhanced TGF-β2-induced EMT through the possible autocrine effect of CXCL1 on CXCR2 in ARPE-19 cells."	"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is characterised by the contraction and growth of fibrotic membranes on the retina and within the vitreous body. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, a major cellular component of the fibrotic membrane, is one of the cell types that have been previously reported to associate with PVR pathogenesis. During PVR, RPE cells undergo increased cell proliferation, migration and the secretion of extracellular matrix molecules, such as fibronectin and type I collagen. A variety of cytokines and growth factors are involved in the formation of the fibrotic membrane. Although gremlin has been reported to serve an important role in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in PVR, the relationship between gremlin and the expression of profibrogenic factors in human RPE cells remains unclear. In the present study, gremlin promoted RPE cell proliferation and the expression of type I collagen and fibronectin. In addition, knocking down gremlin expression by siRNA significantly suppressed the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1- and TGF-β2-induced expression of type I collagen and fibronectin in RPE cells. These findings suggest that gremlin may serve an important role in the development of PVR."	"One of the most common complications of the use of foreign material, in both reconstructive and cosmetic breast surgery, is capsular contracture. Historically, research on capsular contracture has focused mainly on reducing bacterial contamination through antibiotic solutions. Only secondary studies have focused on pharmacological control of the inflammation process, with particular attention paid to the main inflammation pathway, the arachidonic acid cascade. An important role in the arachidonic acid cascade is played by the omega-3 fatty acids, which are found mainly in oily fish and food supplements. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of omega-3 supplements on capsule contraction.Female C57BL/6 mice were implanted with custom-made silicone gel implants and divided into two groups. The treated group received omega-3 oil daily while the control group received water daily by gavage. After mice were euthanized, samples of capsules were collected to evaluate thickness and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β expression.The results showed that capsules in the omega-3 group were thinner and more transparent than those found in the control group. In addition, a significant downregulation of the TGF-β2 gene transcript was observed in the omega-3 group.Omega-3 supplementation seems to be effective in reducing the occurrence of capsular formation, mainly through inhibition of the TGF-β pathway and impairment of collagen deposit. Omega-3 supplementation is a simple and promising method that could be used to prevent or at least reduce capsular contracture after silicone implant surgery."	"Renal fibrosis denotes a common complication of diabetic nephropathy and is a predominant cause of end-stage renal disease. Despite the association between microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) and renal fibrosis, miRNAs have been reported to play a vital role in the development of chronic renal fibrosis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible function of miR-101a in chronic renal fibrosis. Initially, microarray-based gene expression profiling of renal fibrosis was employed to screen the differentially expressed genes. An in vivo mouse model of chronic renal fibrosis induced by a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and an in vitro cell model induced by aristolochic acid (AA) were constructed. miR-101a expression was examined using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, the interaction between miR-101a and KDM3A was identified using an online website combined with a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to elucidate the effect of miR-101a on the expression of Col1a1, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and YAP-TGF-β (transforming growth factor β)-Smad signaling pathway-related genes, as well as the degree of renal fibrosis. miR-101a was poorly expressed while KDM3A was robustly induced in chronic renal fibrosis tissues and cells. In addition, miR-101a could target and downregulate KDM3A expression, which led to elevated TGIF1, inhibited expression of Collagen I (Col1a1), fibronectin, α-SMA, YAP1, and TGF-β2 along with the extent of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, as well as delayed renal fibrosis degree. Besides, overexpressed YAP/TGF-β2 or inhibited TGIF1 partially restored the inhibitory effect of miR-101a on chronic renal fibrosis. Taken together, miR-101a could potentially slow down chronic renal fibrosis by the inactivation of the YAP-TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway via KDM3A, highlighting the potential of miR-101a as a therapeutic target for chronic renal fibrosis treatment."	"Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a pathological process that initially occurs in the weight-bearing field of the femoral head. Due to the unknown pathogenesis, this study was for the investigation of the effect of microRNA-141 (miR-141) targeting transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) on regulating osteoblast activity and osteoclast activity in steroid-induced ONFH.Tissues of ONFH and normal femoral head were collected for detecting the expression of miR-141 and TGF-β2. A rat model of ONFH was constructed by injection of hormones, and transfected with miR-141 inhibitors and overexpressed TGF-β2. The apoptosis of bone cells was detected by TUNEL staining. The expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL), Bcl-2, Bax, Runx2, BMP2 and RANK were detected.Highly expressed miR-141 and lowly expressed TGF-β2 existed in femoral head tissues in ONFH. Inhibited miR-141 resulted in elevated TGF-β2 in femoral head tissues in ONFH of rats. Depressed miR-141 or overexpressed TGF-β2 inhibited the apoptosis of bone cells of rats with ONFH and induced elevated OPG, Bcl-2, BMP2, Runx2 and declined OPGL, Bax and RANK expression in the femoral head tissues of rats with ONFH.Altogether, we find that down-regulated miR-141 promotes osteoblast activity and inhibits osteoclast activity to ameliorate ONFH via up-regulated TGF-β2 expression."	"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle paralysis. Respiratory complications are the main cause of death in ALS. For this reason, initial respiratory status and its decline over disease progression are strong independent predictors of survival. Riluzole, a glutamatergic neurotransmission inhibitor, is the only drug that has shown to extend survival. Therefore, both novel molecular biomarkers and treatment strategies are needed. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines are important regulators of cell fate affecting both neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. Several studies demonstrate that TGF-β signalling protects neurons from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, a recognized mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS. Recent studies report dysregulations of the TGF-β system as a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders. The upregulation of this system has been linked with ALS progression. We have quantified TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 serum levels in 23 ALS patients and 12 healthy controls, our preliminary results support the hypothesis that TGF-β3 levels can be a marker disease severity ALS. Further results are necessary to confirm this hypothesis."
"TGFBR1"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers in the world. MicroRNAs play a pivotal role in the progression of various cancers. To date, very little attention has been paid to miR-4458. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore the function and underlying molecular mechanism of miR-4458 in HCC. We found that the expression of miR-4458 was reduced in HCC tissues and cell lines. Forced overexpression of miR-4458 inhibited the migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells, while downregulation of miR-4458 promoted the aggressive phenotype. Furthermore, transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1), the modulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway, was verified to be a novel target gene of miR-4458 by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Upregulated miR-4458 dramatically abolished TGFBR1 and p-Smad2/3 expression, thus blocking the TGF-β signaling pathway. Moreover, restoration of TGFBR1 partially rescued the miR-4458-mediated suppressive effect on the migration, invasion, and EMT and reactivated the TGF-β signaling pathway in HCC cells. In summary, our findings first demonstrated a mechanism of miR-4458 in HCC cell migration, invasion, and EMT by regulating the TGF-β signaling pathway via directly targeting TGFBR1."	"Patient-oriented applications of cell culture include cell therapy of organ failure like chronic renal failure. Clinical deployment of a cell-based device for artiﬁcial renal replacement requires qualitative and quantitative ﬁdelity of a cultured cell to its in vivo counterpart. Active speciﬁc apicobasal ion transport reabsorbs 90-99% of the ﬁltered load of salt and water in the kidney. In a bioengineered kidney, tubular transport concentrates wastes and eliminates the need for hemodialysis, but renal tubule cells in culture transport little or no salt and water. We previously identiﬁed TGF-β as a signaling pathway necessary for in vitro differentiation of renal tubule cells. Inhibition of TGFBR1 led to active inhabitable electrolyte and water transport by primary human renal tubule epithelial cells in vitro. Addition of metformin increased transport, in the context of a transient effect on AMPK phosphorylation. The signals that undermine in vitro differentiation are complex but susceptible to pharmacologic intervention. This achievement overcomes a major hurdle limiting the development of a bioreactor of cultured cells for renal replacement therapy that encompasses not only endocrine and metabolic functions, but also transport and excretion."	"To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Congrong Shujing Granules ( , CSGs) in treating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome of Shen (Kidney) essence deficiency, and to investigate the potential mechanism involving efficacy through a transcriptome sequencing approach.Eligible PD patients with syndrome of Shen essence defificiency were randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group by a random number table, and were treated with CSGs combined with Western medicine (WM), or placebo combined with WM, respectively. Both courses of treatment lasted for 12 weeks. The Unifified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, the PD Question-39 (PDQ-39) score, CM Syndrome Scale score, and drug usage of all patients were evaluated before and after treatment. Safety was evaluated by clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiographs. Blood samples from 6 patients in each group were collected before and after the trial and used for transcriptomic analysis by gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. Differentially expressed genes were validated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.A total of 86 PD patients were selected from the Third Affifiliated People's Hospital of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between January 2017 and December 2017. Finally, 72 patients completed the trial, including 35 in the treatment group and 37 in the control group. When compared with the control group after treatment, patients in the treatment group showed signifificant decreases in UPDRS sub-II score, PDQ-39 score, CM syndrome score, and Levodopa equivalent dose (P&lt;0.05). During the treatment course, no signifificant changes were observed in safety indicators between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). A possible mechanism of clinical effificacy was proposed that involved regulating cell metabolism-related processes and ribosome-related pathways. Treatment with CSGs had shown to affect relevant gene loci for PD, including AIDA, ANKRD36BP2, BCL2A1, BCL2L11, FTH1P2, GCH1, HPRT1, NFE2L2, RMRP, RPS7, TGFBR1, WIPF2, and COX7B.CSGs combined with WM can be used to treat PD patients with CM syndrome of Shen essence defificiency with a good safety. The possible mechanism of action and relevant gene loci were proposed. (Registration No. ChiCTR-IOR-16008394)."	"Organ transplantation is often lifesaving, but the long-term deleterious effects of combinatorial immunosuppression regimens and allograft failure cause significant morbidity and mortality. Long-term graft survival in the absence of continuing immunosuppression, defined as operational tolerance, has never been described in the context of multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatches. Here, we show that miR-142 deficiency leads to indefinite allograft survival in a fully MHC mismatched murine cardiac transplant model in the absence of exogenous immunosuppression. We demonstrate that the cause of indefinite allograft survival in the absence of miR-142 maps specifically to the T cell compartment. Of therapeutic relevance, temporal deletion of miR-142 in adult mice prior to transplantation of a fully MHC mismatched skin allograft resulted in prolonged allograft survival. Mechanistically, miR-142 directly targets Tgfbr1 for repression in regulatory T cells (T<sub>REG</sub> ). This leads to increased T<sub>REG</sub> sensitivity to transforming growth factor - beta and promotes transplant tolerance via an augmented peripheral T<sub>REG</sub> response in the absence of miR-142. These data identify manipulation of miR-142 as a promising approach for the induction of tolerance in human transplantation."	"Previous studies have reported that p27 deletion stimulates the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and their differentiation into osteoblasts, it also increases bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). However, it is unknown whether the enhanced hematopoiesis induced by p27 deficiency was associated with releasing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and HPC supporting factors by BM-MSCs. To answer this question, we cultured the BM-MSCs from wild-type (WT) or p27 knockout (KO) mice, analyzed their proliferation, apoptosis and osteogenesis and harvested their conditioned medium (CM); We also cultured the bone marrow cells (BMCs) with normal medium or CM from WT or KO BM-MSCs and analyzed changes of HSCs and HPCs and colony forming cells (CFCs). Our results showed that the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs were increased significantly and their apoptosis was reduced significantly in p27 deficient mice. Simultaneously, we demonstrated that the CM from p27 deficient BM-MSCs stimulated the expansion of HSCs/HPCs more dramatically than that from WT BM-MSCs. Five 2-fold up-regulated proteins were identified in the CM from p27 deficient BM-MSCs by protein chip assays, including interleukin-22 (IL-22), transforming growth factor-β type I receptor, tumor necrosis factor-related Apoptosis-inducing ligands, VE-cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor B. We confirmed that expression of IL22 at both mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated significantly in p27 deficient BM-MSCs. The treatment of IL22 increased the percentages of HSCs and HPCs in BMC cultures and the number of CFCs in the colony formation assay, whereas the increased HSC/HPC expansion induced by the CM derived from p27 deficient BM-MSCs was blocked by the addition of anti-IL22 antibody in a dose dependent manner. We also found that the percentages of IL22R1, Stat3 and p-Stat3-S727 positive HSCs and HPCs were increased significantly in p27 deficient BMCs. Our findings in this study indicate that p27 deficiency stimulates HSC/HPC expansion by increasing secretion of IL22 by BM-MSCs and activating IL22-Stat3 signaling in HSCs and HPCs."	"Novel biomarkers are desired to improve risk management for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We measured 179 plasma miRNAs in 83 AF patients using multiplex qRT-PCR. Plasma levels of eight (i.e., hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-130a-3p, hsa-miR-140-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-148b-3p, hsa-miR-497-5p, hsa-miR-652-3p) and three (i.e., hsa-miR-144-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p, hsa-miR-194-5p) miRNAs showed positive and negative correlations with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores, respectively, which also showed negative and positive correlations with catheter ablation (CA) procedure, respectively, within the follow-up observation period up to 6-month after enrollment. These 11 miRNAs were functionally associated with TGF-β signaling and androgen signaling based on pathway enrichment analysis. Seven of possible target genes of these miRNAs, namely <i>TGFBR1</i>, <i>PDGFRA</i>, <i>ZEB1</i>, <i>IGFR1</i>, <i>BCL2</i>, <i>MAPK1</i> and <i>DICER1</i> were found to be modulated by more than four miRNAs of the eleven. Of them, TGFBR1, PDGFRA, ZEB1 and BCL2 are reported to exert pro-fibrotic functions, suggesting that dysregulations of these eleven miRNAs may reflect pro-fibrotic condition in the high-risk patients. Although highly speculative, these miRNAs may potentially serve as potential biomarkers, providing mechanistic and quantitative information for pathophysiology in daily clinical practice with AF such as possible pro-fibrotic state in left atrium, which would enhance the risk of stroke and reduce the preference for performing CA."	"We previously demonstrated that collagen metabolism affects scleral mechanical properties and scleral remodeling. Scleral remodeling changes the mechanical strain on sclera and scleral fibroblasts. We postulated that mechanical strain changes affect collagen metabolism in scleral fibroblasts. To understand the differences in collagen metabolism in scleral fibroblasts related to mechanical strain changes, scleral fibroblasts were isolated and cultured under different mechanical strains using the FX-4000 system or were treated with the TGF-β1 and TGFBR1 inhibitor LY364947. The collagen metabolism-related gene expression levels were detected. The results showed that the appropriate (lower) mechanical strain improved collagen synthesis and reduced collagen decomposition. In contrast, higher mechanical strain reduced collagen synthesis and enhanced collagen decomposition, especially a sustained higher strain. Furthermore, the effect of a transitory higher strain was recoverable, and collagen metabolism in scleral fibroblasts was regulated by TGF-β1. These results suggested that mechanical strain mediates TGF-β1 expression to regulate collagen metabolism in scleral fibroblasts, thereby affect scleral tissue remodeling."	"Keloid is a benign dermal tumor with excessive hyperplasia and deposition of collagen. As a common tumor suppressor gene, miR-133a-3p has not been studied in keloid. This study will delve into the specific mechanism of miR-133a-3p in keloid.Normal skin fibroblasts and keloid fibroblasts (KFs) were first isolated from patients' normal skin and keloid, and cells were identified by morphological observation and immunofluorescence. The expressions of miR-133a-3p and extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated markers (Collagen I, III and α smooth muscle activin) were detected by Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell viability and apoptosis of KFs were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Caspase-3 colorimetry. TargetScan predicted target gene for miR-133a-3p was verified by luciferase assay, qRT-PCR and Western Blot (WB). WB was used to study protein expression of TGFBR1, phosphorylated -Smad2 (p-Smad2) and Smad2. Finally, a series of rescue experiments were performed to verify the intervention of target genes on miR-133a-3p.MiR-133a-3p was lowly expressed in keloid tissue and KFs. Overexpression of miR-133a-3p inhibited the expression of ECM-associated markers, reduced KFs viability, and promoted apoptosis. It was verified that interference regulator 5 (IRF5) is miR-133a-3p target gene. The rescue experiments showed that IRF5 reversed the effect of miR-133a-3p mimic on inhibiting fibrosis, and reversed the effects on promoting apoptosis and reducing cell proliferation.Overexpressed miR-133a-3p inhibits fibrosis by down-regulating IRF5 and thus inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad2 pathway. And it also promotes KFs apoptosis and reduces proliferation."	"The transforming growth factor beta-receptor I/activin receptor-like kinase 5 (TGFBR1/ALK5) and its close homologue ALK4 are receptor protein kinases associated with the development of diverse diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, heart diseases, and dysfunctional immune response. Therefore, ALK4/5 are among the most studied kinases, and several inhibitors have been developed. However, current commercially available inhibitors either lack selectivity or have not been comprehensively characterized, limiting their value for studying ALK4/5 function in cellular systems. To this end, we report the characterization of the 2-oxo-imidazopyridine, TP-008, a potent chemical probe with dual activity for ALK4 and ALK5 as well as the development of a matching negative control compound. TP-008 has excellent cellular potency and strongly abrogates phosphorylation of the substrate SMAD2 (mothers against decapentaplegic homologue 2). Thus, this chemical probe offers an excellent tool for mechanistic studies on the ALK4/5 signaling pathway and the contribution of these targets to disease."	"The pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is closely linked to overactive TGFβ signaling. TGFβ is produced and circulates in latent form, making its activation crucial for signaling. This activation can be mediated via integrins. We investigated the balance between active and latent TGFβ in serum of SSc patients and investigated if this correlates with integrin expression on monocytes.A TGFβ/SMAD3- or BMP/SMAD1/5-luciferase reporter construct was expressed in primary human skin fibroblasts. Both acidified and non-acidified sera of ten SSc patients and ten healthy controls were tested on these cells to determine total and active TGFβ and BMP levels respectively. A pan-specific TGFβ1/2/3 neutralizing antibody was used to confirm TGFβ signaling. Monocytes of 20 SSc patients were isolated using CD14+ positive selection, and integrin gene expression was measured using qPCR. Integrin expression was modulated using rhTGFβ1 or a small molecule inhibitor of TGFBR1: SB-505124.SSc sera induced 50% less SMAD3-reporter activity than control sera. Serum acidification increased reporter activity, but a difference between healthy control and SSc serum was no longer observed, indicating that total TGFβ levels were not different. Addition of a pan-specific TGFβ1/2/3 neutralizing antibody fully inhibited SMAD3-reporter activity of both acidified and not-acidified control and SSc sera. Both HC and SSc sera induced similar SMAD1/5-reporter activity, and acidification increased this, but not differently between groups. Interestingly, expression of two integrin alpha subunits ITGA5 and ITGAV was significantly reduced in monocytes obtained from SSc patients. Furthermore, ITGB3, ITGB5, and ITGB8 expression was also reduced in SSc monocytes. Stimulation of monocytes with TGFβ1 induced ITGA5 and ITGAV but lowered ITGB8 expression, whereas the use of the TGFβ receptor inhibitor SB-505124 had the opposite effect.Total TGFβ serum levels are not different between SSc patients and controls, but TGFβ activity is. This coincides with a reduced expression of TGFβ-activating integrins in monocytes of SSc patients. Because TGFβ regulates expression of these integrins in monocytes, a negative feedback mechanism possibly underlies these observations."	"BUB1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles-1) is required for efficient TGF-β signaling, through its role in stabilizing the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 complex. Here we demonstrate that TGFBR2 phosphorylates BUB1 at Serine-318, which is conserved in primates. S318 phosphorylation abrogates the interaction of BUB1 with TGFBR1 and SMAD2. Using BUB1 truncation domains (1-241, 241-482 and 482-723), we demonstrate that multiple contact points exist between BUB1 and TGF-β signaling components and that these interactions are independent of the BUB1 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Moreover, substitutions in the middle domain (241-482) encompassing S318 reveals that efficient interaction with TGFBR2 occurs only in its dephosphorylated state (241-482 S318A). In contrast, the phospho-mimicking mutant (241-482 S318D) exhibits efficient binding with SMAD2 and its over-expression results in a decrease in TGFBR1-TGFBR2 and TGFBR1-SMAD2 interactions. These findings suggest that TGFBR2 mediated BUB1 phosphorylation at S318 may serve as a switch for the dissociation of the SMAD2-TGFBR complex, and therefore represents a regulatory event for TGF-β signaling. Finally, we provide evidence that the BUB1-TGF-β signaling axis may mediate aggressive phenotypes in a variety of cancers."	"<b>                        <i>Background:</i>                    </b> Acquired lymphedema is a common consequence of cancer surgery. Fibrosis is one of the main causes of chronic lymphedema since it hinders lymphatic regeneration and this causes a significant decrease in lymphatic flow and accumulation of excessive protein-rich fluid. The transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling pathway is known in a process of wound repair and fibrosis. In our study, the purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of EW-7197, a peroral TGF-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor, in treating acquired lymphedema. <b>                        <i>Methods and Results:</i>                    </b> For lymphedema mouse tail model, we used 10- to 12-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. The skin was circumferentially excised, making a circular band followed by cauterization of lymphatic collecting vessels. Two groups were made in this study: control and treatment. The treatment group (<i>n</i> = 12) received a solution consisting of 0.1 mL of artificial gastric juice and 20 mg/kg EW-7197 by gavage once daily. For evaluation, tail diameter measurement, fluorescence lymphography, and immunofluorescence images were used. EW-7197 treatment ameliorates acquired lymphedema in a mouse tail model by increasing lymphangiogenesis and interstitial flow of the lymphatics by inhibition of the fibrosis. The differences in maximal tail thicknesses between the control and treatment groups were statistically significant from 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. The treatment group showed a greater number of lymphatic vessels at the surgery site than the control group. The treatment group also showed more FITC coverage area at the surgery site. <b>                        <i>Conclusion:</i>                    </b> EW-7197 treatment ameliorates acquired lymphedema in a mouse tail model by increasing lymphangiogenesis and interstitial flow."	"Most breast cancers are derived from the luminal epithelium, which composes the inside of the breast ductal structure. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) leads to invasive ductal carcinoma, but noncancerous intraductal proliferative lesions are also a risk factor for ductal carcinoma. The transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) signaling pathway behaves as a tumor suppressor in the early stage of cancer, and conversely as a tumor growth factor in invasive stages in several cancers. In this study, we performed immunohistochemistry with an antibody that detects the cytoplasmic region of TGFB receptor 1 (TGFBR1) and elucidated TGFBR1 protein expression in luminal epithelial cells of noncancerous breast ducts and in several cases of DCIS and invasive carcinoma. TGFBR1 expression was higher in noncancerous breast tissue than in cancerous tissue, and a difference in expression was also seen among histological subtypes. Comparing the expression level of TGFBR1 in cancer cells and clinico-pathological parameters, cases expressing low TGFBR1 tended to show low estrogen receptor expression, large tumor size (≥10 mm), and a high Ki67 labeling index. These data suggested that TGFBR1 protein expression may be related to the suppression of breast cancer cell growth."	"A new regulatory subpopulation of ILCs, ILCreg has been identified in mouse and human intestines. ILCregs share characteristics with both innate lymphoid cells and regulatory cells; however, the significance of CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> ILCregs in patients with AML remains unclear. Intriguingly, ILCregs constitutively express id2, id3, sox4, tgfbr1, tgfbr2, il2rb and il2rg, but the significance of miRNAs associated with these genes has yet to be explored. In this study, we evaluate ILCreg frequency, ILCreg gene-associated miRNA quantification, and its significance in patients with AML and normal donors.Using 4 color combinations of surface and intracellular antibody staining, the CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> ILCregs from 12 normal donors and 42 patients newly diagnosed with AML were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma samples and bone marrow cells from 6 normal donors and 9 patients with AML were studied by next-generation sequence miRNAs quantification.Our results showed that the frequency of ILCregs was 0.8924±1.3791% in bone marrow (BM) cells from normal donors and 0.2434±0.5344% in BM cells from AML patients. The frequency of ILCreg cells in AML patients was significantly lower than that in normal donors (P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the frequency of the CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>-</sup> subset was 4.0869±6.7701% and 0.2769±0.2526% from normal donors and AML patients, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference of CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>-</sup> cells between normal donors and AML patients (p&lt;0.01). miRNA detection results showed 376 miRNAs from plasma and 182 miRNAs from BM cell samples with expression levels with a statistically significant difference between AML patients and normal donors (both Q and P-value &lt; 0.001). Analysis of miRNAs from ILCregs associated genes including id2, id3, sox4, tgfbr1, tgfbr2, il2rb, and il3rg, from normal donors and AML patients demonstrated 34 miRNA from plasma samples and 14 miRNA segments from BM cell samples with a statistically significant difference between AML patients and normal donors (both Q and P-value &lt;0.001). Among them, 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-193b-3p, hsa-miR-1270, hsa-miR-210-3p, and hsa-miR-486-3p) were detected in both plasma and BM cell samples.Our study enumerated ILCregs, then measured miRNAs from those ILCregs in AML samples for the first time. The results demonstrated the deficiency of ILCreg and differential expression of miRNAs in patients with AML."	"NUSAP1 has been reported to be involved in the progression of several types of cancer. However, its expression and exact role in bladder cancer (BLCA) remains elusive. The aim of this study was to determine the expression and role of NUSAP1 in BLCA.Tissue microarray, real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry assays were carried out to determine NUSAP1 expression in BLCA tissues and cells. The biological roles of NUSAP1 were investigated using CCK-8, EdU labeling, flow cytometry, Transwell, and wound healing assays. Additionally, the effect of NUSAP1 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was investigated by Western blotting and real-time PCR.We found that NUSAP1 was upregulated in BLCA, and its expression was closely related to the poor prognosis of patients. Subsequently, we transfected 5637 and T24 cell lines with NUSAP1 siRNA and an NUSAP1 overexpression plasmid, respectively. NUSAP1 downregulation in 5637 cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness and enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine, while NUSAP1 overexpression in T24 cells resulted in the inverse effects. Moreover, NUSAP1 regulated EMT via the TGF-β signaling pathway, and when TGF-beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1) was inhibited with the inhibitor SB525334, the invasion and metastasis ability of BLCA cells was significantly suppressed, as well as p-Smad2/3 and vimentin expression.Our above data demonstrate that NUSAP1 contributes to BLCA progression via the TGF-β signaling pathway."	"In rodent models of depression, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R)-ketamine remain unknown. Using RNA-sequencing analysis, we identified novel molecular targets that contribute to the different antidepressant effects of the two enantiomers. Either (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) or (S)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) was administered to susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). RNA-sequencing analysis of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and subsequent GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis) revealed that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling might contribute to the different antidepressant effects of the two enantiomers. (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine, ameliorated the reduced expressions of Tgfb1 and its receptors (Tgfbr1 and Tgfbr2) in the PFC and hippocampus of CSDS susceptible mice. Either pharmacological inhibitors (i.e., RepSox and SB431542) or neutralizing antibody of TGF-β1 blocked the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine in CSDS susceptible mice. Moreover, depletion of microglia by the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX3397 blocked the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine in CSDS susceptible mice. Similar to (R)-ketamine, the recombinant TGF-β1 elicited rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects in animal models of depression. Our data implicate a novel microglial TGF-β1-dependent mechanism underlying the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine in rodents with depression-like phenotype. Moreover, TGF-β1 and its receptor agonists would likely constitute a novel rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant in humans."	"Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by a genetic predisposition for thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Despite heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in genes for ligand, receptor, or downstream mediators of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway, LDS is associated with a signature of high TGFβ signaling. We generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from three adult LDS-patients (two male, one female) of a family with a heterozygous point mutation in exon 4 of the TGFβ-receptor1 (TGFBR1) gene (p.M253I; c.759G&gt;A). The lines offer a valuable resource for modeling the pathophysiology of genetically mediated aortic disease."	"Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) is involved in fibrosis as well as the regulation of muscle mass, and contributes to the progressive pathology of muscle wasting disorders. However, little is known regarding the time-dependent signalling of TGF-β in myoblasts and myotubes, as well as how TGF-β affects collagen type I expression and the phenotypes of these cells. Here, we assessed effects of TGF-β on gene expression in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes after 1, 3, 9, 24 and 48 h treatment. In myoblasts, various myogenic genes were repressed after 9, 24 and 48 h, while in myotubes only a reduction in <i>Myh3</i> expression was observed. In both myoblasts and myotubes, TGF-β acutely induced the expression of a subset of genes involved in fibrosis, such as <i>Ctgf</i> and <i>Fgf-2,</i> which was subsequently followed by increased expression of <i>Col1a1</i>. Knockdown of <i>Ctgf</i> and <i>Fgf-2</i> resulted in a lower <i>Col1a1</i> expression level. Furthermore, the effects of TGF-β on myogenic and fibrotic gene expression were more pronounced than those of myostatin, and knockdown of TGF-β type I receptor <i>Tgfbr1</i>, but not receptor <i>Acvr1b,</i> resulted in a reduction in <i>Ctgf</i> and <i>Col1a1</i> expression. These results indicate that, during muscle regeneration, TGF-β induces fibrosis via <i>Tgfbr1</i> by stimulating the autocrine signalling of <i>Ctgf</i> and <i>Fgf-2.</i>"	"The pathophysiology of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM) of the lung remains poorly understood.This study aimed to identify more precisely the molecular mechanisms limited to a compartment of lung tissue, through a transcriptomic analysis of the epithelium of macrocystic forms.Tissue fragments displaying CCAM were obtained during planned surgical resections. Epithelial mRNA was obtained from cystic and normal areas after laser capture microdissection (LCM). Transcriptomic analyses were performed and the results were confirmed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in independent samples.After controlling for RNA quality, we analysed the transcriptomes of six cystic areas and five control areas. In total, 393 transcripts were differentially expressed in the epithelium, between CCAM and control areas. The most highly redundant genes involved in biological functions and signalling pathways differentially expressed between CCAM and control epithelium included TGFB2, TGFBR1, and MAP 2 K1. These genes were considered particularly relevant as they have been implicated in branching morphogenesis. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed in independent samples that TGFBR1 was more strongly expressed in CCAM than in control tissues (p &lt; 0.03). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed TGFBR1 (p = 0.0007) and TGFB2 (p &lt; 0.02) levels to be significantly higher in the epithelium of CCAM than in that of control tissues.This compartmentalised transcriptomic analysis of the epithelium of macrocystic lung malformations identified a dysregulation of TGFB signalling at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a possible role of this pathway in CCAM pathogenesis.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01732185."

"TGFBR2"	"familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection"	"Endothelial dysfunction is critically involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and that exogenously administered microRNA may be of therapeutic benefit. Lower levels of miR-483 were found in serum from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), particularly those with more severe disease. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses showed that miR-483 targets several PAH-related genes, including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), TGF-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2), β-catenin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Overexpression of miR-483 in ECs inhibited inflammatory and fibrogenic responses, revealed by the decreased expression of TGF-β, TGFBR2, β-catenin, CTGF, IL-1β, and ET-1. In contrast, inhibition of miR-483 increased these genes in ECs. Rats with EC-specific miR-483 overexpression exhibited ameliorated pulmonary hypertension (PH) and reduced right ventricular hypertrophy on challenge with monocrotaline (MCT) or Sugen + hypoxia. A reversal effect was observed in rats that received MCT with inhaled lentivirus overexpressing miR-483. These results indicate that PAH is associated with a reduced level of miR-483 and that miR-483 might reduce experimental PH by inhibition of multiple adverse responses."	"Glioblastoma (GBM) belongs to the high-grade (IV) gliomas with extremely poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence uncovered the key roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in GBM development. This study aimed to determine the biological actions and the clinical relevance of lncRNA MIR4435-2 Host Gene (MIR4435-2HG) in GBM. Data from GEPIA database showed that MIR4435-2HG was up-regulated in GBM tissues and high expression of MIR4435-2HG correlated with shorter overall survival of GBM patients. Further experimental assays verified the up-regulation of MIR4435-2HG in GBM tissues and cell lines. In vitro cell studies and in vivo animal studies showed that knockdown of MIR4435-2HG resulted in the inhibition of GBM cell proliferation and invasion and in vivo tumour growth, while MIR4435-2HG overexpression driven GBM progression. Furthermore, MIR44435-2HG was found to sponge miR-1224-5p and suppress miR-1224-5p expression; overexpression of miR-1224-5p attenuated the enhancement in GBM cell proliferation and invasion induced by MIR4435-2HG overexpression. In a subsequent study, miR-1224-5p was found to target transforming growth factor-beta receptor type 2 (TGFBR2) and repressed TGFBR2 expression, and in vitro assays showed that miR-1224-5p exerted tumour-suppressive effects via targeting TGFBR2. More importantly, TGFRB2 knockdown antagonized hyper-proliferation and invasion of GBM cells with MIR4435-2HG overexpression. Clinically, the down-regulation of miR-1224-5p and up-regulation of TGFBR2 were verified in the GBM clinical samples. Taken together, the present study suggests the oncogenic role of MIR4435-2HG in GBM and underlies the key function of MIR4435-2HG-driven GBM progression via targeting miR-1224-5p/TGFBR2 axis."	"Treatment of tendon injuries is challenging. To develop means to augment tendon regeneration, we have previously prepared a soluble, low immunogenic (DNA-free), tendon extracellular matrix fraction (tECM) by urea extraction of juvenile bovine tendons, which is capable of enhancing transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) mediated tenogenesis in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of tECM-driven hASC tenogenic differentiation in vitro, focusing on the integrin and TGF-β/SMAD pathways. Our results showed that tECM promoted hASC proliferation and tenogenic differentiation in vitro based on tenogenesis-associated markers. tECM also induced higher expression of several integrin subunits and TGF-β receptors, and nuclear translocation of p-SMAD2 in hASCs. Pharmacological inhibition of integrin-ECM binding, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, or TGF-β signaling independently led to compromised pro-tenogenic effects of tECM and actin fiber polymerization. Additionally, integrin blockade inhibited tECM-driven TGFBR2 expression, while inhibiting TGF-β signaling decreased tECM-mediated expression of integrin α1, α2, and β1 in hASCs. Together, these findings suggest that the strong pro-tenogenic bioactivity of tECM is regulated via integrin/TGF-β signaling crosstalk. Understanding how integrins interact with signaling by TGF-β and/or other growth factors (GFs) within the tendon ECM microenvironment will provide a rational basis for an ECM-based approach for tendon repair."	"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), recognized as a crucial factor in regulating fibrosis and tissue remodeling, plays a role in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). Pentraxin-3 (PTX3), a member of pentraxins, was recently implicated in many autoimmune and fibrotic diseases. Thus, we hypothesize if there is a potential correlation between TGF-β and PTX3 in orbital fibroblasts (OFs).Several strains of OFs obtained from patients with TAO (n = 8) and healthy donors (n = 3) were established as the study model. Recombinant TGF-β1 was exerted as an intervention and the expression of PTX3 was detected. To uncover the underlying mechanism, specific inhibitors of TGF-β and siRNA knockdown of Smads were utilized.We found that TGF-β1 can reduce PTX3 protein expression in OFs. We also demonstrated that this downregulation was mediated at a pretranslational level, and PTX3 mRNA was inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by TGF-β1. Interestingly, the basic level of PTX3 and the magnitude of suppression were not significantly different between TAO and control groups. Furthermore, the TGF-β receptor complex (type I:type II) and the Smad2/3-Smad4-dependent pathway are essential for TGF-mediated PTX3 repression.These findings indicated that TGF-β1 can inhibit PTX3 expression in human OFs, which may participate in inflammation and fibrosis in patients with TAO and provide a potential target for the antifibrotic treatment."	"Microglia are constantly surveying their microenvironment and rapidly react to impairments by changing their morphology, migrating toward stimuli and adopting gene expression profiles characterizing their activated state. The increased expression of the M2-like marker <i>Mannose receptor 1</i> (<i>Mrc1</i>), which is also referred to as CD206, in microglia has been reported after M2-like activation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <i>Mrc1</i> is a 175-kDa transmembrane pattern recognition receptor which binds a variety of carbohydrates and is involved in the pinocytosis and the phagocytosis of immune cells, including microglia, and thought to contribute to a neuroprotective microglial phenotype. Here we analyzed the effects of TGFβ signaling on <i>Mrc1</i> expression in microglia <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Using C57BL/6 wild type and <i>Cx3cr1 <sup>                            <i>CreERT2</i>                        </sup> :R26-YFP:Tgfbr2 <sup>                            <i>fl/fl</i>                        </sup></i> mice-derived microglia, we show that the silencing of TGFβ signaling results in the upregulation of <i>Mrc1</i>, whereas recombinant TGFβ1 induced the delayed downregulation of <i>Mrc1</i>. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence that <i>Mrc1</i> is not a direct Smad2/Smad4 target gene in microglia. Altogether our data indicate that the changes in <i>Mrc1</i> expression after the activation or the silencing of microglial TGFβ signaling are likely to be mediated by modifications of the secondary intracellular signaling events influenced by TGFβ signaling."	"Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) has pleiotropic actions, including both anti- and pro-tumorigenic abilities. We have previously shown no tumor development in the thyroid-specific TGFβ receptor type II knockout (Tgfβr2 KO) mice, indicating the insufficiency of defective TGFβ signal itself for thyroid cancer initiation. In the current study, we evaluated whether defective TGFβ signal accelerates BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mediated thyroid carcinogenesis in our mouse model, in which intrathyroidal injection of adenovirus expressing Cre under thyroglobulin (TG) promoter (Ad-TgP-Cre) into thyroid lobes of conditional Braf<sup>V600E</sup> knock-in mice (Braf<sup>CA</sup>) induces thyroid cancers 12 months later.Braf<sup>CA/wt</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>floxE2/floxE2</sup> mice were generated by crossing Tgfbr2<sup>floxE2/floxE2</sup> and Braf<sup>CA</sup> mice, and Ad-TgP-Cre was injected into the left lobes of 4-6-week-old mice. Mice were sacrificed at 6 and 12 months, and the thyroid tissues were subjected to H&amp;E and immune-histochemistry and -fluorecence.Thyroid tumors were observed in 8 of 10 mice at 6 months and 4 of 7 mice at 12 months. These tumors were judged to be malignant by H&amp;E staining, because of the presence of papillary growth of atypical follicular cells, intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions and so on. Immunohistochemical analyses using thyroid cancer tissues obtained at 6 months demonstrated variable levels of TG but steady levels of Paired Box-8 expression and higher Ki67 positivity. The degree of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition could not be evaluated because normal thyroid tissues and thyroid cancers developed in Braf<sup>CA</sup> and Braf<sup>CA/wt</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>floxE2/floxE2</sup> mice were all E-cadherin<sup>+</sup>/vimentin<sup>-</sup>, that is, epithelial type.In a mouse model, defective TGFβ signaling pathway accelerates BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced thyroid cancer development, which is occasionally accompanied by reduced TG expression implying dedifferentiation. The former finding is consistent with anti-tumorigenic ability of TGFβ in early tumorigenic process, but the latter is contradictory to generally accepted concept for TGFβ-induction of dedifferentiation."	"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can play important roles in uterine and ovarian functions. However, little researches have been done on the role of lncRNAs in the adrenal gland of sheep. Herein, RNA sequencing was used to compare and analyze gene expressions in adrenal tissues between follicular phases and luteal phases in FecB<sup>BB</sup> (MM) and FecB<sup>++</sup> (WW) sheep, respectively, and differentially expressed lncRNAs and genes associated with reproduction were identified.In MM sheep, 38 lncRNAs and 545 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the adrenal gland between the luteal and follicular phases; In WW sheep, 513 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 2481 mRNAs were identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses indicated that differentially expressed lncRNAs and their target genes are mainly involved in the circadian rhythm, the mitogen activated protein kinase, thyroid, ovarian steroidogenesis and transforming growth factor beta signaling pathways. Differentially expressed lncRNAs can regulate reproduction by modulating genes involved in these signaling pathways and biological processes. Specifically, XLOC_254761, XLOC_357966, 105,614,839 and XLOC_212877 targeting CREB1, PER3, SMAD1 and TGFBR2, respectively, appear to play key regulatory roles.These results broaden our understanding of lncRNAs in adrenal gland of sheep and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sheep reproduction."	"To analyze the prostatic compartments, extracellular matrix, microvascularization, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and angiotensin II receptors type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) levels, and histopathology of the ventral prostate in a rat model for rheumatoid arthritis, and to evaluate the effect of angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blocker (ARB) in the disease.Fifteen male rats (90 days old) were divided into three groups (n = 5/group): control, adjuvant-induced arthritis without (AIA) or with AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blocker (AIA + ARB). Animals were euthanized 60 days after immunization. The ventral prostate was collected, weighed, and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.Our results show that AIA increases production of the prostatic epithelium and extracellular matrix, accompanied by a reduction in the number of tissue capillaries. ARB treatment promotes decreased production of extracellular matrix and increased TGF-β and AT<sub>1</sub> receptor immunostaining.AIA may activate specific mechanisms that modify the prostatic environment; the use of ARB attenuates some altered prostate parameters in a rat model for arthritis."	"The present study aimed to assess the changes in circulating microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles associated with the potential osteoprotective effect of diosgenin (DIO) in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Wistar rats (female) were subjected to a sham operation (SHAM group) or ovariectomy. OVX rats were treated with DIO (DIO group) or vehicle (OVX group) for 12 weeks. Following treatment, the serum estradiol, bone turnover biomarker levels, and the microarchitecture of tibias were assayed. Based on miRNA microarray and qRT-PCR analyses, differentially expressed (DE) circulating miRNAs were identified between the OVX and SHAM groups (comparison A) and between the DIO and OVX groups (comparison B). Furthermore, putative target genes of shared DE miRNAs with opposite expression trends in the two comparisons were predicted by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Finally, the expression levels of the putative target genes in serum and tibia were validated by qRT-PCR. The micro-CT results demonstrated that DIO had a substantial anti-osteopenic effect on the tibias of OVX rats. In total, we found 5 DE circulating miRNAs (four upregulated and one downregulated) in comparison A and 21 DE circulating miRNAs (15 upregulated and 6 downregulated) in comparison B. However, only one DE circulating miRNA (rno-miR-20a-5p) had opposite expression trends between the two comparisons. Including rno-miR-20a-5p, 7 of the 10 selected DE circulating miRNAs between the two comparisons passed qRT-PCR validation. Specifically, based on qRT-PCR validation, DIO upregulated the expression of rno-miR-20a-5p and downregulated that of three target genes (<i>Tnf</i>, <i>Creb1</i>, and <i>Tgfbr2</i>) of the &quot;osteoclast differentiation&quot; pathway in the tibias of OVX rats. Our results suggested that DIO could change the circulating miRNA profile of OVX rats and inhibited the downregulation of miR-20a-5p in serum and tibia. DIO might exert an anti-osteoclastogenic effect on OVX rats by upregulating the expression of miR-20a-5p in circulation and bone tissue."	"Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening disease, of which genetic abnormalities are considered as important risk factors. The present research aims at identifying causal variants in Chinese patients with sporadic non-syndromic type A TAAD (ATAAD).Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 73 sporadic Chinese patients with ATAAD, 30 TAAD associated genes were curated for bioinformatic analyses. Clinical differences were compared between patients with and without causal variants.15 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified (8 novel and 7 previously described) in 4 known TAAD-causal genes (FBN1, TGFBR2, SMAD3 and ACTA2) in 15 individuals, including 11 variants in FBN1 (7 missense, 3 truncating, and 1 splicing variants), 2 missense variants in TGFBR2, 1 ACTA2 frameshift variant and 1 SMAD3 frameshift variant. Significant clinical differences were found between patients with and without causal variants. Patients with TAAD-causal variants proved to have an earlier onset age, a more dilated aorta, and relatively intractable subtypes. Even without risk factor like hypertension, they might still suffer from TAAD with TAAD-causal variants.The variants identified in our research might not only result in the occurrence of ATAAD, but also add complexities and difficulties to the clinical practice. Our data demonstrated that WES was an effective tool for determining genetic etiologies of non-syndromic ATAAD and could be helpful in genetic counseling for ATAAD patients and their at-risk family members."	"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a medium vessel vasculitis that affects young children. Despite extensive research over the last 50 years, the etiology of KD remains an enigma. Seasonal change in wind patterns was shown to have correlation with the epidemics of KD in Japan. Occurrence of disease in epidemiological clusters, seasonal variation, and a very low risk of recurrence suggest that KD is triggered by an infectious agent. The identification of oligoclonal IgA response in the affected tissues suggests an antigen-driven inflammation. The recent identification of a viral antigen in the cytoplasm of bronchial ciliated epithelium also favors infection as the main trigger for KD. Pointers that suggest a genetic basis of KD include a high disease prevalence in North-East Asian populations, a high risk among siblings, and familial occurrence of cases. Dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses are evident in the acute stages of KD. In addition to the coronary wall inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and impaired vascular remodeling contribute to the development of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) and thrombosis. Genetic aberrations in certain intracellular signaling pathways involving immune effector functions are found to be associated with increased susceptibility to KD and development of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). Several susceptible genes have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and linkage studies (GWLS). The genes that are studied in KD can be classified under 4 major groups-enhanced T cell activation (ITPKC, ORAI1, STIM1), dysregulated B cell signaling (CD40, BLK, FCGR2A), decreased apoptosis (CASP3), and altered transforming growth factor beta signaling (TGFB2, TGFBR2, MMP, SMAD). The review aims to highlight the role of several genetic risk factors that are linked with the increased susceptibility to KD."	"To evaluate aortic disease progression and reintervention after an initial thoracic aortic dissection in pathogenic variant carriers.Of 175 participants diagnosed with thoracic aortic dissection, 31 had a pathogenic variant (pathogenic group) across 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFBR2) identified by whole exome sequencing. Those with benign or normal variants (benign/normal group, n = 144) comprised the control group. Clinical data were collected through medical record review (1985-2018) and supplemented with the National Death Index database (December 2018).The entire cohort (n = 175) consisted of 108 type A aortic dissections and 67 type B aortic dissections, similarly distributed between groups. The pathogenic group was significantly younger (43 vs 56 years, P &lt; .0001) and had significantly more aortic root replacements and similar extents of arch replacement at initial type A aortic dissection repair. The median follow-up time was 7.5 (4.6-12) years. After initial treatment, the pathogenic group required significantly more aortic reinterventions (median 1 vs 0, P &lt; .0001) and mean cumulative aortic reinterventions for each patient (10 years: 1 vs 0.5, P = .029). Both incidence rate (12%/year vs 1.2%/year, P = .0001) and cumulative incidence of reinterventions (9 years: 70% vs 6%, P &lt; .0001) for the preserved native aortic root were significantly higher in the pathogenic group, but were similar for the preserved native aortic arch and distal aorta between groups. Ten-year survival was similar in the pathogenic and benign/normal groups (92% vs 85%).Aggressive aortic root replacement and similar arch management should be considered in pathogenic variant carriers at initial type A aortic dissection repair compared with benign/normal variant carriers."	"Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been proved to be involved in regulating female reproduction. However, to what extent lincRNAs are involved in ovarian functions and fertility is incompletely understood. Here we show that a lincRNA, NORFA is involved in granulosa cell apoptosis, follicular atresia and sow fertility. We found that NORFA was down-regulated during follicular atresia, and inhibited granulosa cell apoptosis. NORFA directly interacted with miR-126 and thereby preventing it from binding to TGFBR2 3'-UTR. miR-126 enhanced granulosa cell apoptosis by attenuating NORFA-induced TGF-β signaling pathway. Importantly, a breed-specific 19-bp duplication was detected in NORFA promoter, which proved association with sow fertility through enhancing transcription activity of NORFA by recruiting transcription factor NFIX. In summary, our findings identified a candidate lincRNA for sow prolificacy, and provided insights into the mechanism of follicular atresia and female fertility."	"Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs) are an emerging drug class in gene modification. In our study we developed a safe, stable, and effective ASO drug candidate in locked nucleic acid (LNA)-gapmer design, targeting TGFβ receptor II (TGFBR2) mRNA. Discovery was performed as a process using state-of-the-art library development and screening. We intended to identify a drug candidate optimized for clinical development, therefore human specificity and gymnotic delivery were favored by design. A staggered process was implemented spanning <i>in-silico</i>-design, <i>in-vitro</i> transfection, and <i>in-vitro</i> gymnotic delivery of small batch syntheses. Primary <i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i> toxicity studies and modification of pre-lead candidates were also part of this selection process. The resulting lead compound NVP-13 unites human specificity and highest efficacy with lowest toxicity. We particularly focused at attenuation of TGFβ signaling, addressing both safety and efficacy. Hence, developing a treatment to potentially recondition numerous pathological processes mediated by elevated TGFβ signaling, we have chosen to create our data in human lung cell lines and human neuronal stem cell lines, each representative for prospective drug developments in pulmonary fibrosis and neurodegeneration. We show that TGFBR2 mRNA as a single gene target for NVP-13 responds well, and that it bears great potential to be safe and efficient in TGFβ signaling related disorders."	"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal cancer, mainly attributing to its high tendency to metastasis. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) are related to human cancer onset and progression including invasion and metastasis.An eligible gene dataset and an eligible miRNA dataset were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database based our screening criteria. Differentially expressed genes (DE-genes) or DE-miRNAs for each dataset obtained by the R software package. The potential target genes of the top 10 DE-miRNAs were predicted by multiple databases. For annotation, visualization and integrated discovery, Metascape 3.0 was introduced to perform enrichment analysis for the DE-genes and the predicted target genes of the selected top 10 DE-miRNAs, including Pathway and Process Enrichment Analysis or protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis. The intersection of predicted target genes and DE-genes was taken as the final DE-genes. Then apply the predicted miRNAs-targets relationship of top 10 DE-miRNAs to the final DE-genes to gain more convinced DE-miRNAs, DE-genes and their one to one relationship.GSE19945 (miRNA microarray) and GSE40275 (gene microarray) datasets were selected and downloaded. 56 DE-miRNAs and 861 DE-genes were discovered. 297 miRNAs-targets relationships (284 unique genes) were predicted as the target of top 10 upregulating DE-miRNAs. 245 miRNAs-targets relationships (238 unique genes) were identified as the target of top 10 downregulating DE-miRNAs. The key results of enrichment analysis include protein kinase B signaling, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, negative regulation of cell differentiation, response to growth factor, cellular response to lipid, muscle structure development, response to growth factor, signaling by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases, epithelial cell migration, cellular response to organic cyclic compound, Cell Cycle (Mitotic), DNA conformation change, cell division, DNA replication, cell cycle phase transition, blood vessel development, inflammatory response, Staphylococcus aureus infection, leukocyte migration, and myeloid leukocyte activation. Differential expression of genes-upstream miRNAs (RBMS3-hsa-miR-7-5p, NEDD9-hsa-miR-18a-5p, CRIM1-hsa-miR-18a-5p, TGFBR2-hsa-miR-9-5p, MYO1C-hsa-miR-9-5p, KLF4-hsa-miR-7-5p, EMP2-hsa-miR-1290, TMEM2-hsa-miR-18a-5p, CTGF-hsa-miR-18a-5p, TNFAIP3-hsa-miR-18a-5p, THBS1-hsa-miR-182-5p, KPNA2-hsa-miR-144-3p, GPR137C-hsa-miR-1-3p, GRIK3-hsa-miR-144-3p, and MTHFD2-hsa-miR-30a-3p) were identified in SCLC.RBMS3, NEDD9, CRIM1, KPNA2, GPR137C, GRIK3, hsa-miR-7-5p, hsa-miR-18a-5p, hsa-miR-144-3p, hsa-miR-1-3p along with the pathways included protein kinase B signaling, muscle structure development, Cell Cycle (Mitotic) and blood vessel development may gain a high chance to play a key role in the prognosis of SCLC, but more studies should be conducted to reveal it more clearly."	"<b>Background:</b> Systemic sclerosis (SSc) T cells can induce apoptosis of autologous skin fibroblasts <i>in vitro</i>. Th17 cells have been reported to increase in SSc patients, and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has a profibrotic function. We used a system based on T-cell-autologous fibroblast co-cultures to further investigate a possible role of IL-17A in SSc. <b>Methods:</b> T cells from diffuse SSc patients were co-cultured with autologous skin fibroblasts. <i>IL17A</i> mRNA was assessed by real-time PCR in co-cultured and control T cells, while <i>IL17RA, CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3, COL1A1, COL3A1, CTGF, TGFBR2</i>, and <i>SMAD3</i> mRNAs were assessed in co-cultured and control fibroblasts. In subset experiments, co-cultures and control cells were treated with either IL-17A or IL-17A <i>plus</i> anti-IL17 receptor monoclonal antibody (α-IL-17RA mAb). Chemokine and procollagen type I (PCI) production was further investigated at the protein level in cell culture supernatants by multiple suspension immunoassay and sandwich ELISA, respectively. Co-cultured and control fibroblasts were also stained with Annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry. <b>Results:</b> T cell-fibroblast co-cultures overexpressed <i>IL17A</i> and <i>IL17RA</i>. Furthermore, co-cultured fibroblasts upregulated IL-17A targets <i>CXCL1, CCL2</i>, and <i>CCL3</i>, while <i>COL1A1, COL3A1, CTGF</i>, and two key effectors of the TGF-β signaling, <i>TGFBR2</i> and <i>SMAD3</i>, were found downregulated. Consistently, chemokine concentrations were increased in co-culture supernatants, while PCI levels were reduced, especially after stimulation with ectopic IL-17A. Finally, simultaneous α-IL-17RA mAb treatment restored PCI levels and reduced fibroblast apoptosis in IL-17A-stimulated co-cultures. <b>Conclusion:</b> These data suggest that IL-17A upregulation might play a role in modulating T cell-mediated antifibrotic and proapoptotic effects in co-cultured autologous skin fibroblasts."	"This study investigated the effects of exercise training on cardiac inflammatory and cardiac fibrotic pathways in female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which were divided into a sham-operated sedentary hypertensive group (SHR-S), a sedentary hypertensive ovariectomized group (SHR-O), or a hypertensive ovariectomized group with treadmill exercise training (SHR-OT; 60 min/day, 5 days/wk) for 8 wk. Normotensive female Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) served as controls. SOD and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly increased in the SHR-OT group, when compared with the SHR-S or SHR-O groups. The protein levels of estrogen receptor (ER)-α and ER-β became decreased in the SHR-O group, when compared with the WKY or SHR-S groups, but were not changed in the SHR-OT group. The protein level of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>R) was increased in the SHR-S group but did not further change in the SHR-O group, whereas it was decreased in the SHR-OT group. The inflammatory-related protein levels of TNF-α, p-NF-κB, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and IL-6, as well as the fibrotic-related protein levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), p-Smad2/3, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and collagen I were increased in the SHR-S group and increased further in the SHR-O group, whereas they were decreased in the SHR-OT group. The coexistence of hypertension and ovariectomy additively increased cardiac inflammatory and fibrotic pathways partially through hypertension-enhanced AT<sub>1</sub>R and ovariectomy-depressed estrogen receptors. Exercise training appeared to suppress hypertensive ovariectomized heart-induced inflammatory and fibrotic pathways possibly through decreasing AT<sub>1</sub>R but not through estrogen receptors.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> The coexistence of hypertension and ovariectomy appeared to increase cardiac inflammatory and fibrotic pathways likely through hypertension-enhanced angiotensin II type I receptor and ovariectomy-depressed estrogen receptors. Exercise training on a treadmill could prevent hypertensive ovariectomized heart-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis via an inflammatory pathway [TNF-α, p-IKK-α/β, p-NF-κB, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), iNOS, and IL-6] and fibrotic pathway [transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), p-Smad2/3, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and collagen I] possibly through decreasing angiotensin II type I receptor but not through estrogen receptors."	"Although several studies have linked PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 μm) to ocular surface diseases such as keratitis and conjunctivitis, very few studies have previously addressed its effect on the retina. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in disorders of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) on APRE-19 cells. PM<sub>2.5</sub> changed the phenotype of RPE cells from epithelial to fibroblast-like mesenchymal, and increased cell migration. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> markedly increased the expression of mesenchymal markers, but reduced the levels of epithelial markers. Moreover, PM<sub>2.5</sub> promoted the phosphorylation of MAPKs and the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated nuclear transcriptional factors. However, these PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mediated changes were completely reversed by LY2109761, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-β receptor type I/II kinases, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Interestingly, NAC, but not LY2109761, effectively restored the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced mitochondrial defects, including increased ROS, decreased mitochondrial activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. Collectively, our findings indicate that the TGF-β/Smad/ERK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway is activated downstream of cellular ROS during PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced EMT. The present study provides the first evidence that EMT of RPE may be one of the mechanisms of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced retinal dysfunction."	"BUB1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles-1) is required for efficient TGF-β signaling, through its role in stabilizing the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 complex. Here we demonstrate that TGFBR2 phosphorylates BUB1 at Serine-318, which is conserved in primates. S318 phosphorylation abrogates the interaction of BUB1 with TGFBR1 and SMAD2. Using BUB1 truncation domains (1-241, 241-482 and 482-723), we demonstrate that multiple contact points exist between BUB1 and TGF-β signaling components and that these interactions are independent of the BUB1 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Moreover, substitutions in the middle domain (241-482) encompassing S318 reveals that efficient interaction with TGFBR2 occurs only in its dephosphorylated state (241-482 S318A). In contrast, the phospho-mimicking mutant (241-482 S318D) exhibits efficient binding with SMAD2 and its over-expression results in a decrease in TGFBR1-TGFBR2 and TGFBR1-SMAD2 interactions. These findings suggest that TGFBR2 mediated BUB1 phosphorylation at S318 may serve as a switch for the dissociation of the SMAD2-TGFBR complex, and therefore represents a regulatory event for TGF-β signaling. Finally, we provide evidence that the BUB1-TGF-β signaling axis may mediate aggressive phenotypes in a variety of cancers."	"Combined inhibition of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) displayed additive anti-tumor response in a subgroup of cancer patients, highlighting the importance of understanding the multifaceted roles of TGF-β in immunity and fibrosis. In the present research, we show that TGF-β signaling pathway, controlled by miR-20a-5p and transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2), alters the inflammation and fibrosis processes in liver. We performed integrated analysis of differently expressed miRNA (DEM) associated with liver fibrosis and screened miR-20a-5p out as a key regulator in inflammation-driven liver fibrosis. We subsequently conducted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the genes targeted by miR-20a-5p. And the result showed that 12 target genes were significantly enriched in TGF-β signaling pathway. Further study showed that miR-20a-5p was down-regulated and involved in inflammation during liver fibrosis in human and mouse samples, indicating that miR-20a-5p and inflammation are functionally linked during liver fibrosis progression. To uncover the underlying pro-inflammatory mechanism of miR-20a-5p in liver fibrosis, we selected and verified TGFBR2, which is a key functional receptor in TGF-β signaling pathway, as a direct target gene of miR-20a-5p. The downregulation of miR-20a-5p in liver fibrosis resulted in TGFBR2-activated TGF-β signaling pathway, followed by the activation of macrophage and extracellular matrix (ECM) production by hepatic stellate cell (HSC). Our results identify the miR-20a-5p/TGFBR2 axis as a key regulator of TGF-β signaling, and highlight the critical role of miR-20a-5p in the development of liver fibrosis."
"ACTG1"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Vitrification is widely used in assisted reproductive technologies. However, the nervous system of vitrification offspring is of concern, and research on this is lacking. Vitrification-born mice (vitrification group), conventional <i>in vitro</i> fertilization-embryo transfer pregnancy-born mice (IVF group), and natural pregnancy-born mice (control group) were used to study the effects of vitrification of mouse embryos on protein levels in the brain of offspring. Proteins differentially expressed among the three groups were analyzed using proteomic methods, including two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify the expression of differentially expressed proteins, such as Actb and Actg1, in each group. Twenty differentially expressed proteins in the brain tissue were identified using two-dimensional protein electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins were related to the development of anatomical structure, signal transduction, transport, cell differentiation, and stress response (biological processes) and the binding of molecules <i>in vivo</i> (molecular functions). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in 54 pathways, including phagosome, metabolic pathway, apoptosis, and cysteine and methionine metabolism. Thus, embryo vitrification may cause some changes in the mouse brain at the protein level, necessitating further safety assessment."	"Pulmonary hypertension occurs in approximately 1% of the global population, and the prognosis for such patients may be poor. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of this disease remain unclear. Thus, understanding the development of pulmonary hypertension and finding new therapeutic targets and approaches are important for improved clinical outcomes.Lung tissue specimens were collected from six patients with atrial septal defect and pulmonary hypertension (all women, with a mean age of 46.5 ± 4.7 years, and their condition could not be corrected with an internal medical occlusion device) and from nine control patients with lung cancer who underwent lobectomy (six men and three women, with a mean age of 56.7 ± 1.7 years). Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses were used to detect protein expression levels.We found 74 significantly upregulated and 88 significantly downregulated differentially expressed proteins between control and pulmonary hypertensive lung tissue specimens. Gene ontology analyses identified the top 20 terms in all three categories, that is, biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and protein-protein interaction analyses determined the top 10 signaling pathways and found that the six hub proteins associated with the differentially expressed upregulated proteins (PRKAA1, DHPR, ACTB, desmin, ACTG1, and ITGA1) were all involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy.Our results identified protein expression profile changes in lung tissue derived from patients with pulmonary hypertension, providing potential new biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis for patients with pulmonary hypertension and offering candidate protein targets for future therapeutic drug development."	"Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual disability, which is caused by mutations in either the ACTB or ACTG1 genes. In this report, we described novel phenotypic findings in two Mexican patients with the disorder in whom two novel ACTG1 mutations (c.176A &gt; G, p.Gln59Arg; and c.608C &gt; T, p.Thr203Met) were identified."	"To delineate the clinical features,inheritance pattern, and genotype-phenotype correlation of a Chinese patient with a 17q25.3 duplication.Whole exome sequencing(WES), chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), chromosomal karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed for the analysis of the proband and his family members.A 5.7 Mb duplication at 17q25.3→qter was identified by WES and CMA in the 4-year-old boy with multiple congenital anomalies, which was classified as a clinically pathogenic variant. This duplication was confirmed by FISH, and was inherited from his unaffected mother who carried a balanced translocation. Further study revealed that his grandmother also carried the balanced translocation but had gestated three healthy children and had no abortion history. His uncle also carried the balanced translocation, while his aunt was normal.Above results have enriched the clinical phenotypes of 17q25.3 duplication. Genetic counseling was provided for the family. P4HB, ACTG1, BAIAP2 and TBCD genes may underlie the clinical features for the 17q25.3 duplication."	"Latest statistics showed that the morbidity and mortality of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, around the world. COAD was a heterogeneous disease, and the high rates of recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance still posed great challenges for treatment, which needs to further develop therapeutic and prognostic targets. In this study, we got the top 3,075 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 1,613 potential prognostic genes by GEPIA 2 and identified 1,166 fitness genes in COAD based on genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) screening data. Excluding the genes already reported in the literatures, a total of nine DEGs overlapping with prognostic and fitness genes were further analyzed. High expression of <i>CCT6A</i>, <i>RHOQ</i>, and <i>RRP12</i> promoted COAD cell growth and were relative to lower survival rate of COAD patients, while high expression of <i>UTP18</i>, <i>DDOST</i>, <i>YRDC</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>RFT1</i>, and <i>NLE1</i> also promoted COAD cell growth, but were relative to higher survival rate. In addition, <i>CCT6A</i>, <i>UTP18</i>, <i>YRDC</i>, <i>RRP12</i>, <i>RFT1</i>, <i>NLE1</i>, as well as <i>DDOST</i> were essential genes across pan-cancer including COAD cells, and <i>ACTG1</i> and <i>RHOQ</i> were less essential genes in cancer cells. In a word, we discovered nine novel potential genes that could serve as anticancer targets and prognostic markers in COAD and its subtypes."	"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that represents the most common cause of dementia in the United States. Although the link between alcohol use and AD has been studied, preclinical research has potential to elucidate neurobiological mechanisms that underlie this interaction. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that nondependent alcohol drinking exacerbates the onset and magnitude of AD-like neural and behavioral pathology. We first evaluated the impact of voluntary 24-h, two-bottle choice home-cage alcohol drinking on the prefrontal cortex and amygdala neuroproteome in C57BL/6J mice and found a striking association between alcohol drinking and AD-like pathology. Bioinformatics identified the AD-associated proteins MAPT (Tau), amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), and presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) as the main modulators of alcohol-sensitive protein networks that included AD-related proteins that regulate energy metabolism (ATP5D, HK1, AK1, PGAM1, CKB), cytoskeletal development (BASP1, CAP1, DPYSL2 [CRMP2], ALDOA, TUBA1A, CFL2, ACTG1), cellular/oxidative stress (HSPA5, HSPA8, ENO1, ENO2), and DNA regulation (PURA, YWHAZ). To address the impact of alcohol drinking on AD, studies were conducted using 3xTg-AD mice that express human MAPT, APP, and PSEN-1 transgenes and develop AD-like brain and behavioral pathology. 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice consumed alcohol or saccharin for 4 months. Behavioral tests were administered during a 1-month alcohol-free period. Alcohol intake induced AD-like behavioral pathologies in 3xTg-AD mice including impaired spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze, diminished sensorimotor gating as measured by prepulse inhibition, and exacerbated conditioned fear. Multiplex immunoassay conducted on brain lysates showed that alcohol drinking upregulated primary markers of AD pathology in 3xTg-AD mice: Aβ 42/40 ratio in the lateral entorhinal and prefrontal cortex and total Tau expression in the lateral entorhinal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala at 1-month post alcohol exposure. Immunocytochemistry showed that alcohol use upregulated expression of pTau (Ser199/Ser202) in the hippocampus, which is consistent with late-stage AD. According to the NIA-AA Research Framework, these results suggest that alcohol use is associated with Alzheimer's pathology. Results also showed that alcohol use was associated with a general reduction in Akt/mTOR signaling via several phosphoproteins (IR, IRS1, IGF1R, PTEN, ERK, mTOR, p70S6K, RPS6) in multiple brain regions including hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Dysregulation of Akt/mTOR phosphoproteins suggests alcohol may target this pathway in AD progression. These results suggest that nondependent alcohol drinking increases the onset and magnitude of AD-like neural and behavioral pathology in 3xTg-AD mice."	"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNL) is the most prevalent sensory deficit in our environment. Next generation genomic sequencing (NGS) enables an aetiological diagnosis in a high percentage of patients. Our pilot study shows the results of the systematic application of NGS in a Childhood Hearing Loss Unit, as well as its implications for the clinical management of patients and their families.We included 27 patients diagnosed with SNL between 2014 and 2017, in which an environmental cause was ruled out. The genetic test consisted of a panel of genes analyzed by NGS (OTOgenicsTM panel). This panel has been designed to include genes associated with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss, early onset or late, syndromic and non-syndromic, regardless of their inheritance pattern.A genetic diagnosis was obtained in 56% (15/27) of the patients (62% in the case of bilateral SNL). Of the patients, 5/27 (19%) presented pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene and the rest pathogenic and / or probably pathogenic variants in other genes associated with isolated SNL (PR2X2, TECTA and STRC), with syndromic SNL (CHD7, GATA3, COL4A5, MITF and SOX10) or with syndromic and non-syndromic SNL (BSND, ACTG1 and CDH23).The aetiological diagnosis of SNL is a challenge in clinical practice. Our series demonstrates that it is possible to implement genetic diagnosis in the care routine and that this information has prognostic and therapeutic implications."	"To perform a prospective genetic investigation using whole exome sequencing of a group of patients with syndromic short stature born small for gestational age of unknown cause.For whole exome sequencing analysis, we selected 44 children born small for gestational age with persistent short stature, and additional features, such as dysmorphic face, major malformation, developmental delay, and/or intellectual disability. Seven patients had negative candidate gene testing based on clinical suspicion and 37 patients had syndromic conditions of unknown etiology.Of the 44 patients, 15 (34%) had pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes already associated with growth disturbance: COL2A1 (n = 2), SRCAP (n = 2), AFF4, ACTG1, ANKRD11, BCL11B, BRCA1, CDKN1C, GINS1, INPP5K, KIF11, KMT2A, and POC1A (n = 1 each). Most of the genes found to be deleterious participate in fundamental cellular processes, such as cell replication and DNA repair.The rarity and heterogeneity of syndromic short stature make the clinical diagnosis difficult. Whole exome sequencing allows the diagnosis of previously undiagnosed patients with syndromic short stature."	"Comprehensive studies of the effects of prolonged exposure to space conditions and the overload experienced during landing on physiological and biochemical changes in the human body are extremely important in the context of planning long-distance space flights, which can be associated with constant overloads and various risk factors for significant physiological changes. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) can be considered as a valuable subject for monitoring physiological changes and is more suitable for long-term storage than traditional monitoring subjects such as blood and urine. Herein, the EBC proteome changes due to the effects of spaceflight factors are analyzed. Thirteen EBC samples were collected from five Russian cosmonauts (i) one month before flight (background), (ii) immediately upon landing modules in the field (R0) after 169-199 days spaceflights, and (iii) on the seventh day after landing (R+7). Semi-quantitative label-free EBC proteomic analysis resulted in 164 proteins, the highest number of which was detected in EBC after landing (R0). Pathways enrichment analysis using the GO database reveals a large group of proteins which take part in keratinization processes (<i>CASP14</i>, <i>DSG1</i>, <i>DSP</i>, <i>JUP</i>, and so on). Nine proteins (including <i>KRT2</i>, <i>KRT9</i>, <i>KRT1</i>, <i>KRT10</i>, <i>KRT14</i>, <i>DCD</i>, <i>KRT6C</i>, <i>KRT6A</i>, and <i>KRT5</i>) were detected in all three groups. A two-sample Welch's <i>t</i>-test identified a significant change in KRT2 and KRT9 levels after landing. Enrichment analysis using the KEGG database revealed the significant participation of detected proteins in pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> infection (<i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBA1C</i>, <i>TUBA4A</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB8</i>, and <i>YWHAZ</i>), which may indicate microbiota changes associated with being in space. This assumption is confirmed by microbial composition analysis. In general, the results suggest that EBC can be used for noninvasive monitoring of health status and respiratory tract pathologies during spaceflights, and that the obtained data are important for the development of medicine for use in extreme situations. Data are available from ProteomeXchange using the identifier PXD014191."	"Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological tumors in females. DNA methylation alteration is a type of epigenetic decoration that controls the gene transcriptional regulation and is essential for the pathological progression of cervical cancer to reflect the prognosis and therapeutic sensitivity in clinical practice. Beyond DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation considered as a more stable biomarker draws the outline of the reversible cycle from DNA methylation and demethylation. However, the landscape of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) distributed in the genome is never characterized in cervical cancer. In this study, we presented the whole 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5hmC profile in cervical cancer of I-IIa and IIb to IV stages and cervicitis tissues as control by dot plot assay and immunohistochemistry. We observed that the total 5mC was up-regulated while 5hmC was down-regulated in cervical cancer group compared to the control group. Furthermore, we investigated the distribution of 5mC and 5hmC on genomic DNA by MeDIP- and hMeDIP-Seq. 53 differential methylation/hydromethylation regions (DMRs/DHMRs) displayed a continuously increasing or decreasing trend of 5mC or 5hmC from cervicitis to I-IIa and from I-IIa to IIb-IV stages of cervical cancer. Thirty-seven DMRs and DHMRs have a similar variation trend while the other 8 have the opposite trend compared between CSCC and cervicitis. Moreover, the DMR/DHMR associated genes were closely related to Wnt, MAPK, Rap1 and other important signaling pathways. Finally, 5hmC beyond 5mC at the genes such as ACTG1, SALL3, DNAJA3, SERPINB6, CDC14B and CALN1 were considered as the putative novel hallmarks for cervical cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Altogether, this study first describes the DNA hydroxymethylation atlas of cervical cancer and shows a list of novel genes transcriptionally regulated by DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation."	"Cytoplasmic Actin Gamma 1 (<i>ACTG1</i>) gene variant are autosomal dominant and can cause CNS anomalies (Baraitser Winter Malformation Syndrome; BWMS). <i>ACTG1</i> anomalies in offspring include agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and neuronal heterotopia which are ectopic nodules of nerve cells that failed to migrate appropriately. Subcortical and periventricular neuronal heterotopia have been described previously in association with ACC. In this case report, we investigated a neonatal brain with an <i>ACTG1</i> gene variant and a phenotype of ACC, and neuronal heterotopia (ACC-H) which was diagnosed on antenatal MR imaging and was consistent with band heterotopia seen on post-mortem brain images. Histologically clusters of neurons were seen in both the subcortical and periventricular white matter (PVWM) brain region that coincided with impaired abnormalities in glial formation. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded brain tissue blocks from this case with <i>ACTG1</i> variant and an age-matched control. Using tissue sections from the frontal lobe, we examined the distribution of neuronal cells (HuC/HuD, calretinin, and parvalbumin), growth cone (drebrin), and synaptic proteins (synaptophysin and SNAP-25). Additionally, we investigated how the <i>ACTG1</i> variant altered astroglia (nestin, GFAP, vimentin); oligodendroglia (OLIG2) and microglia (Iba-1) in the corpus callosum, cortex, caudal ganglionic eminence, and PVWM. As predicted in the <i>ACTG1</i> variant case, we found a lack of midline radial glia and glutamatergic fibers. We also found disturbances in the cortical region, in glial cells and a lack of extracellular matrix components in the <i>ACTG1</i> variant. The caudal ganglionic eminence and the PVWM regions in the <i>ACTG1</i> variant lacked several cellular components that were identified in a control case. Within the neuronal heterotopia, we found evidence of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons with apparent synaptic connections. The data presented from this case study with BWMS with variants in the <i>ACTG1</i> gene provides insight as to the composition of neuronal heterotopia, and how disturbances of important migratory signals may dramatically affect ongoing brain development."	"Recently, many genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified by high-throughput genomic analysis; however, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying neurodevelopmental disorders remains to be established. To further understand these underlying mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of patients with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders.Genomic analysis using next-generation sequencing with a targeted panel was performed for a total of 133 Japanese patients (male/female, 81/52) with previously undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epilepsy. Genomic copy numbers were also analyzed using the eXome Hidden Markov Model (XHMM).Thirty-nine patients (29.3%) exhibited pathogenic or likely pathogenic findings with single-gene variants or chromosomal aberrations. Among them, 20 patients were presented here. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 18 genes, including ACTG1, CACNA1A, CHD2, CDKL5, DNMT3A, EHMT1, GABRB3, GABRG2, GRIN2B, KCNQ3, KDM5C, MED13L, SCN2A, SHANK3, SMARCA2, STXBP1, SYNGAP1, and TBL1XR1.A diagnostic yield of 29.3% in this study was nearly the same as that previously reported from other countries. Thus, we suggest that there is no difference in genomic backgrounds in Japanese patients with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disabilities. Although most of the patients possessed de novo variants, one of the patients showed an X-linked inheritance pattern. As X-linked recessive disorders exhibit the possibility of recurrent occurrence in the family, comprehensive molecular diagnosis is important for genetic counseling."	"Amphibian post-embryonic development and Thyroid Hormones (TH) signaling are deeply and intimately connected. In anuran amphibians, TH induce the spectacular and complex process known as metamorphosis. In paedomorphic salamanders, at similar development time, raising levels of TH fail to induce proper metamorphosis, as many &quot;larval&quot; tissues (e.g., gills, tailfin) are maintained. Why does the same evolutionary conserved signaling pathway leads to alternative phenotypes? We used a combination of developmental endocrinology, functional genomics and network biology to compare the transcriptional response of tailfin to TH, in the post-hatching paedormorphic Axolotl salamander and <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles. We also provide a technological framework that efficiently reduces large lists of regulated genes down to a few genes of interest, which is well-suited to dissect endocrine regulations. We first show that Axolotl tailfin undergoes a strong and robust TH-dependent transcriptional response at post embryonic transition, despite the lack of visible anatomical changes. We next show that Fos and Actg1, which structure a single and dense subnetwork of cellular sensors and regulators, display opposite regulation between the two species. We finally show that TH treatments and natural variations of TH levels follow similar transcriptional dynamics. We suggest that, at the molecular level, tailfin fate correlates with the alternative transcriptional states of an fos-actg1 sub-network, which also includes transcription factors and regulators of cell fate. We propose that this subnetwork is one of the molecular switches governing the initiation of distinct TH responses, with transcriptional programs conducting alternative tailfin fate (maintenance vs. resorption) 2 weeks post-hatching."	"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Ras-related associated with diabetes (RRAD) belongs to the subfamily of Ras-related GTPases and is associated with several types of cancer, including HCC, although the mechanisms involving RRAD in HCC remains unknown.We aimed to elucidate the role of RRAD and whether it affects glucose metabolism in HCC by immunohistochemically examining tissue samples from HCC patients and assessing the effect of RRAD overexpression and knockdown on the glucose metabolism, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of HCC cell lines SK-Hep-1 and Huh7, as well as on tumor progression in vivo.We demonstrated that RRAD binds to actin gamma 1 (ACTG1). RRAD suppressed aerobic glycolysis in HCC by downregulating ACTG1. On the other hand, ACTG1 promoted HCC proliferation by regulating the cell cycle via downregulation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases and inhibited apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in vitro. In addition, RRAD retarded tumor growth by downregulating ACTG1 in vivo. ACTG1 was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, whereas the expression of RRAD was low in tumor tissues. Low RRAD levels were significantly correlated with large tumor size and advanced tumor stage; high ACTG1 levels were significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that HCC patients with high RRAD and low ACTG1 expression may have a better prognosis.We have shown that RRAD exhibits a tumor-suppressing role in HCC by downregulating glucose metabolism and ACTG1 expression, thus lowering cell proliferation, arresting the cell cycle, and increasing apoptosis. These findings indicate that ACTG1 may act as a downstream effector of RRAD and open a new avenue for potential HCC treatment."	"To explore the molecular epidemiology of rare deafness genes in Taiwanese sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) patients with cochlear implantation (CI) by performing massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and correlating genetic factors and CI outcomes.We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes.Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes.We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI."	"To detect drug candidates for dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), we employed a computational drug repositioning method to perform an integrated multiple omics analysis based on transcriptomic, proteomic, and interactomic data. We identified 3,892 significant genes, 389 proteins, and 221 human proteins by transcriptomic analysis, proteomic analysis, and human-dengue virus protein-protein interactions, respectively. The drug candidates were selected using gene expression profiles for inverse drug-disease relationships compared with DHF patients and healthy controls as well as interactomic relationships between the signature proteins and chemical compounds. Integrating the results of the multiple omics analysis, we identified eight candidates for drug repositioning to treat DHF that targeted five proteins (ACTG1, CALR, ERC1, HSPA5, SYNE2) involved in human-dengue virus protein-protein interactions, and the signature proteins in the proteomic analysis mapped to significant pathways. Interestingly, five of these drug candidates, valparoic acid, sirolimus, resveratrol, vorinostat, and Y-27632, have been reported previously as effective treatments for flavivirus-induced diseases. The computational approach using multiple omics data for drug repositioning described in this study can be used effectively to identify novel drug candidates."	"Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the association between alcohol and HCC remains unknown. The present study aimed to identify key genes related to alcohol-associated HCC to improve the current understanding of the pathology of this disease. Alcohol-associated and non-alcohol-associated HCC samples in the GSE50579 dataset of the Gene Omnibus Database were analyzed to investigate altered gene expression. Integrated bioinformatics methods were employed to clarify the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The present study reported that candidate biomarker micro (mi)RNAs via TargetScan Human 7.1. DEGs and their associated miRNAs (according to bioinformatics analysis) were validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, 284 EGs from the GSE50579 dataset were revealed. In GO term analysis, DEGs were closely associated with the 'regulation of nucleic acid metabolism'. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the DEGs were tightly engaged in the 'VEGF and VEGF receptor signaling network', 'proteoglycan syndecan-mediated signaling events', 'erbB receptor signaling' and 'β1 integrin cell surface interactions'. According to the results of PPI and heat map analysis, the main hub genes were centrin 3 (CETN3), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase (ERBB4), heat shock protein family member 8, actin γ1 (ACTG1) and α-smooth muscle actin. it was demonstrated that the ACTG1, TLR3, miR-6819-3p and miRΝΑ (miR)-6877-3P had undefined associations. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that miR-6819-3p and miR-6877-3P may enhance the expression levels of ACTG1 and inhibit the expression levels of TLR3 in alcohol-associated HCC tissues. TLR3 and ACTG1 were proposed as potential biomarkers of alcohol-associated HCC. Investigation into the regulatory functions of miR-6819-3p and miR-6877-3P may provide novel insights into the treatment of alcohol-associated HCC."	"In the absence of antiretroviral treatments (ARTs), a small group of individuals infected with HIV, including long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) who maintain high levels of CD4+ T cells for more than 7-10 years in the absence of ART and in particular a subgroup of LTNPs, elite controllers (ECs), who have low levels of viremia, remain clinically and/or immunologically stable for years. However, the mechanism of stable disease progression in LTNPs and ECs needs to be elucidated to help those infected with HIV-1 remain healthy. In this study, to identify the characteristics of gene expression profiles and biomarkers in LTNPs, we performed a meta-analysis using multiple gene expression profiles among LTNPs, individuals infected with HIV-1 without ART, individuals infected with HIV-1 with ART, and healthy controls.The gene expression profiles obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray data repositories were classified into three groups: LTNPs versus healthy controls (first group, 3 studies), LTNPs versus patients infected with HIV-1 without ART (second group, 3 studies), and LTNPs versus patients infected with HIV-1 with ART (third group, 3 studies). In addition, we considered a fourth group, patients infected with HIV-1 without ART versus healthy controls (3 studies), to exclude genes associated with HIV-1 infection in the three groups. For each group, we performed a meta-analysis using the RankProd method to identify and compare the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the three groups.We identified the 14 common DEGs in the three groups when comparing them with each other. Most belonged to immune responses, antigen processing and presentation, the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, and T cell co-stimulation. Of these DEGs, PHLDA1 was up-regulated and ACTB and ACTG1 were down-regulated in all three groups. However, the rest of the up- or down-regulated genes were discordant in the three groups. Additionally, ACTB and ACTG1 are known to inhibit viral assembly and production, and THBS1 is known to inhibit HIV-1 infection.These results suggest that significant genes identified in a meta-analysis provide clues to the cause of delayed disease progression and give a deeper understanding of HIV pathogenesis in LTNPs."	"Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is a common disorder characterized by a huge genetic heterogeneity. The definition of a correct molecular diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling, recurrence risk estimation, and therapeutic options. From 20 to 40% of patients carry mutations in <i>GJB2</i> gene, thus, in more than half of cases it is necessary to look for causative variants in the other genes so far identified (~100). In this light, the use of next-generation sequencing technologies has proved to be the best solution for mutational screening, even though it is not always conclusive. Here we describe a combined approach, based on targeted re-sequencing (TRS) of 96 HHL genes followed by high-density SNP arrays, aimed at the identification of the molecular causes of non-syndromic HHL (NSHL). This strategy has been applied to study 103 Italian unrelated cases, negative for mutations in <i>GJB2</i>, and led to the characterization of 31% of them (i.e., 37% of familial and 26.3% of sporadic cases). In particular, TRS revealed <i>TECTA</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> genes as major players in the Italian population. Furthermore, two <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>ACTG</i>1 have been identified and investigated through protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, confirming their likely pathogenic effect. Among the selected patients analyzed by SNP arrays (negative to TRS, or with a single variant in a recessive gene) a molecular diagnosis was reached in ~36% of cases, highlighting the importance to look for large insertions/deletions. Moreover, copy number variants analysis led to the identification of the first case of uniparental disomy involving <i>LOXHD1</i> gene. Overall, taking into account the contribution of <i>GJB2</i>, plus the results from TRS and SNP arrays, it was possible to reach a molecular diagnosis in ~51% of NSHL cases. These data proved the usefulness of a combined approach for the analysis of NSHL and for the definition of the epidemiological picture of HHL in the Italian population."	"Hearing loss is an economically and socially important cause of human morbidity, affecting 360 million people (over 5% of the world's population), of whom 32 million are children. Of the estimated minimum of 50% of hereditary hearing loss, non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) accounts for more than 70%. The autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) is highly heterogeneous. To date, 67 ADNSHL loci (DFNA1-67) have been mapped; however, only 35 causative genes have been cloned since 1997 (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/).To identify the genetic basis of hereditary hearing loss in a Chinese family with ADNSHL, we undertook a targeted sequencing of 180 genes using a custom capture panel (MiamiOtoGenes).The onset of hearing loss in the family occurred between the ages of 15 and 18 years. Hearing loss was bilateral, started in the high frequency and progressed to lower frequencies. The c.353A&gt;T (K118M) in the <i>AC TG1</i> gene was identified by panel and was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and was present in all affected family members. So far, five of the 23 DFNA20/26 families worldwide have been found to carry mutation involving the residue K118.This is the first report of K118M mutation in the <i>ACTG1</i> gene causing hearing loss in the Chinese population. The present data are in line with previous evidence to suggest that codon K118 of ACTG1 may represent a mutational hot spot that justifies a mutation screen for diagnostic purpose in the genetically heterogeneous group of DFNA20/26."
"COCH"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Octenyl-succinylated inulins (OSA-inulin) were synthesized in aqueous solutions using inulin with varying degrees of polymerization (DP). They were characterized using <sup>1</sup>H NMR and FTIR and their degrees of substitution were determined. All the samples formed micellar aggregates in aqueous solution above a critical aggregation concentration (CAC) and solubilized beta-carotene. The amount of beta carotene solubilized within the micelles ranged from 12 to 25 mg/g of OSA-inulin and depended on the inulin molar mass. Dynamic light scattering showed that the aggregates, with and without dissolved beta-carotene, were ∼10-15 nm in size and this was confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy which also indicated that the micelles had a globular shape. OSA-inulin particles containing encapsulated beta-carotene were produced by freeze-drying. The encapsulated beta-carotene was not released from the freeze-dried particles when introduced into simulated gastric fluid at pH 2.5 but was readily released in simulated small intestinal fluid at pH 7. The results demonstrate the potential application of OSA-inulin in the encapsulation, dissolution and targeted delivery of hydrophobic drug molecules for nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and medical applications."	"Human toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) activation induces a potent T helper-1 (Th1) cell response critical for defense against intracellular pathogens, including protozoa. The receptor harbors two distinct binding sites, uridine and di- and/or trinucleotides, but the RNases upstream of TLR8 remain poorly characterized. We identified two endolysosomal endoribonucleases, RNase T2 and RNase 2, that act synergistically to release uridine from oligoribonucleotides. RNase T2 cleaves preferentially before, and RNase 2 after, uridines. Live bacteria, P. falciparum-infected red blood cells, purified pathogen RNA, and synthetic oligoribonucleotides all required RNase 2 and T2 processing to activate TLR8. Uridine supplementation restored RNA recognition in RNASE2<sup>-/-</sup> or RNASET2<sup>-/-</sup> but not RNASE2<sup>-/-</sup>RNASET2<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Primary immune cells from RNase T2-hypomorphic patients lacked a response to bacterial RNA but responded robustly to small-molecule TLR8 ligands. Our data identify an essential function of RNase T2 and RNase 2 upstream of TLR8 and provide insight into TLR8 activation."	"The supercapacitive performance of high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability is still a big challenge for electroactive materials. Herein, Ni and Zn co-substituted Co carbonate hydroxide (NiZn-CoCH) flowers array is self-assembled on nickel foams (NFs) using l-ascorbic acid as a nanostructure inducer. The NiZn-CoCH flowers, consisting of silk-like nanosheets, are deservedly large electrode-electrolyte contact area and suitable ion-diffusion channel. The nanostructure and Ni and Zn co-substitution significantly improve energy storage performance. This electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2020.8 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> with high-rate capacity (remain 80.2% at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and 5000-cycle stability (almost unchanged after 1500 cycles at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, an assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device of NiZn-CoCH//activated carbon (AC) achieves a high energy density of 29.6 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 375 W kg<sup>-1</sup> and only a 0.5% decrease of the capacitance after 2500 cycles. This facile and novel preparation method, using l-ascorbic acid, may be promising for industrial production of electroactive materials for the high-performance energy storage and conversion devices."	"Despite decades of efforts to develop a pharmacotherapy for cocaine abuse treatment, there is still no FDA-approved treatment of diseases associated with this commonly abused drug. Our previously designed highly efficient cocaine hydrolases (CocHs) and the corresponding Fc-fusion proteins (e.g., CocH3-Fc) are recognized as potentially promising therapeutic enzyme candidates for cocaine abuse treatment, but all with limited biological half-lives. In order to prolong the biological half-life and, thus, decrease the required frequency of the enzyme administration for cocaine abuse treatment, we have modeled the Fc-fusion CocH binding with neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in the present study. This approach led to the design and testing of CocH3-Fc(M6), a CocH3-Fc mutant with nearly 100-fold increased binding affinity: from K<sub>d</sub> = ~ 4 μM to K<sub>d</sub> = 43 nM. As a result, CocH3-Fc(M6) indeed revealed a markedly prolonged biological half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 206 ± 7 h or ~ 9 days) in rats, longer than other known Fc-fusion protein drugs such as abatacept and alefacept (for other therapeutic purposes) in the same species (rats). It has been demonstrated that a single dose of 3 mg/kg CocH3-Fc(M6) effectively blocked 20 mg/kg cocaine-induced hyperactivity on day 18 after CocH3-Fc(M6) administration. This is the first attempt to rationally design long-acting Fc-fusion enzyme mutant based on combined computational modeling and experimental measurement of the Fc-fusion CocH binding with FcRn. The similar structure-based design strategy may be used to prolong the biological half-lives of other Fc-fusion protein drugs."	"The abundance and diversity of intermediate filaments (IFs) in the C. elegans intestine indicate important contributions to intestinal function and organismal wellbeing. Fluorescent IF reporters localize below the actin-rich brush border and are highly enriched in the lumen-enveloping endotube, which is attached to the C. elegans apical junction. Mapping intestinal viscoelasticity by contact-free Brillouin microscopy reveals that the IF-rich endotube is positioned at the interface between the stiff brush border and soft cytoplasm suggesting a mechanical buffering function to deal with the frequent luminal distortions occurring during food intake and movement. In accordance, depletion of IFB-2, IFC-2 and IFD-2 leads to intestinal lumen dilation although depletion of IFC-1, IFD-1 and IFP-1 do not. Ultrastructural analyses of loss of function mutants further show that IFC-2 mutants have a rarefied endotube and IFB-2 mutants lack an endotube altogether. Remarkably, almost all IFB-2- and IFC-2-deficient animals develop to fertile adults. But developmental retardation, reduced brood size, altered survival and increased sensitivity to microbial toxin, osmotic and oxidative stress are seen in both mutants albeit to different degrees. Taken together, we propose that individual intestinal IF polypeptides contribute in different ways to endotube morphogenesis and cooperate to cope with changing environments."	"Liver cancer is the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide, and waist circumference (WC) is associated with its risk beyond body mass index (BMI). This dose-response meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between WC and the risk of incident liver cancer using prospective cohort studies.A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science databases, Scopus, and Coch-rane from inception to May 2019. Studies with retrospective or prospective cohort design that reported hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio, or odds ratio, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for liver cancer based on WC categories were included in this meta-analysis. Combined HRs with 95% CIs was estimated by DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models.Associations between WC and liver cancer were reported in 5 articles with 2,547,188 participants. All studies were published between 2013 and 2019. Pooled results showed a strong significant association with minimum heterogeneity between WC and risk of liver cancer (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.38-1.83, <i>p</i>&lt;sub&gt;heterogeneity&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.42: <i>I</i>&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Moreover, a dose-response model indicated a significant positive association between WC and risk of liver cancer (exp(b) = 1.018, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis highlights WC as a significant risk factor related to the incidence of liver cancer."	"Dose requirements of vitamin K antagonists are associated with <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i>, but, compared to warfarin, less data is available about phenprocoumon. Furthermore, the effects on dose stability and anticoagulation quality are still unclear.Aim was to scrutinize phenprocoumon dose requirements, dose stability and anticoagulation quality in association to <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> in a natural cohort of elderly primary care patients. As a subgroup within the IDrug study, phenprocoumon treated patients with at least two INR values within three months before enrollment (n = 209) were analyzed concerning average weekly dose, standard deviation of weekly dose (intra-subject variability), constant dose (yes/no), average INR and TTR grouped by <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> (and combinations).Average weekly dose per patient was 14.4 ± 5.3 mg, 11.9 ± 4.0 mg and 11.2 ± 4.3 mg in <i>CYP2C9</i> wildtypes, <i>*2</i> and <i>*3</i> carriers (p &lt; .0001) and 16.0 ± 4.2 mg, 13.3 ± 5.1 mg and 8.0 ± 2.7 mg per week in <i>VKORC1</i> CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively (p &lt; .0001). Significant differences concerning intra-subject variability were detected among all groups (p &lt; .0001) with the smallest variability in <i>CYP2C9*3</i> carriers. TTR medians were 75.4%, 79.4% and 100% in wildtypes, <i>*2</i> and <i>*3</i> carriers, respectively (p = 0.0464). The proportion of patients with perfect control was highest among <i>*3</i> carriers, but this result was not significant (p = 0.0713).Our analyses support the results of previous investigations regarding genotype-associated dose requirements and raise the hypothesis that dose stability and anticoagulation quality may be increased in <i>CYP2C9*3</i> carriers. However, our data should be treated cautiously due to the small sample size.German Clinical Trials Register, identifier DRKS00006256."	"Glucagon is classically described as a counterregulatory hormone that plays an essential role in the protection against hypoglycemia. In addition to its role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, glucagon has been described to promote ketosis in the fasted state. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new class of glucose-lowering drugs that act primarily in the kidney, but some reports have described direct effects of SGLT2i on α-cells to stimulate glucagon secretion. Interestingly, SGLT2 inhibition also results in increased endogenous glucose production and ketone production, features common to glucagon action. Here, we directly test the ketogenic role of glucagon in mice, demonstrating that neither fasting- nor SGLT2i-induced ketosis is altered by interruption of glucagon signaling. Moreover, any effect of glucagon to stimulate ketogenesis is severely limited by its insulinotropic actions. Collectively, our data suggest that fasting-associated ketosis and the ketogenic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors occur almost entirely independent of glucagon."	"<b>Background and Purpose:</b> Radiologic abnormalities on computed tomography (CT), including narrowing or sclerosis of the semicircular canals (SCCs), and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including signal loss in the SCC, have been reported as potential biomarkers in patients with P51S mutations in the <i>COCH</i> gene (i.e., DFNA9). The aim of our study was to correlate caloric responses through electronystagmography (ENG) data with imaging results in DFNA9 patients. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A retrospective study was performed in 45 patients; therefore, 90 ears with P51S mutations in the <i>COCH</i> gene were tested. Caloric responses and CT and MRI data were analyzed from June 2003 until May 2014. More than half of patients (54%) were candidates for cochlear implantation. <b>Results:</b> In our population, 91% of tested ears had sclerotic lesions and/or narrowing in one or more SCCs on CT scan. All tested ears had narrowing or signal loss in at least one SCC on T2-weighted MRI. The lateral SCC was affected in 87% on CT scan and 92% on MRI. However, in 83% of tested ears, all three SCCs were affected on MRI. Furthermore, in 77% of tested ears, caloric responses were reduced bilaterally, while 11.5% showed unilateral hypofunction and the other 11.5% had normal caloric responses. CT abnormalities correlated with hypofunction of caloric responses. This statistically significant difference was present if abnormalities were observed in at least one of the SCCs as well as in ipsilateral lateral SCC function loss. MRI abnormalities in at least one of the SCCs correlated with ENG hypofunction, but there was no direct correlation between lateral SCC abnormalities on MRI and caloric responses of the investigated lateral canal. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our retrospective analysis confirms the presence of CT and MRI abnormalities in DFNA9 patients with the P51S mutation in the <i>COCH</i> gene. A correlation between these radiologic features and vestibular function (tested by means of caloric response) was found in this population."	"Protein <i>N</i>-glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications and is involved in many biological processes, with aberrant changes in protein <i>N</i>-glycosylation patterns being closely associated with several diseases, including the progression and spreading of tumours. In light of this, identifying these aberrant protein glycoforms in tumours could be useful for understanding the molecular mechanism of this multifactorial disease, developing specific biomarkers and finding novel therapeutic targets. We investigated the urinary <i>N</i>-glycoproteome of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients at different stages (<i>n</i> = 15 at pT1 and <i>n</i> = 15 at pT3), and of non-ccRCC subjects (<i>n</i> = 15), using an <i>N</i>-glyco-FASP-based method. Using label-free nLC-ESI MS/MS, we identified and quantified several <i>N</i>-glycoproteins with altered expression and abnormal changes affecting the occupancy of the glycosylation site in the urine of RCC patients compared to control. In particular, nine of them had a specific trend that was directly related to the stage progression: CD97, COCH and P3IP1 were up-expressed whilst APOB, FINC, CERU, CFAH, HPT and PLTP were down-expressed in ccRCC patients. Overall, these results expand our knowledge related to the role of this post-translational modification in ccRCC and translation of this information into pre-clinical studies could have a significant impact on the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic target in kidney cancer."	"To evaluate the use of 2 mg intravitreal aflibercept for treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to angioid streaks in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).In this 12-month prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized interventional clinical trial, 15 PXE patients with CNV (mean age: 53 years, range 22-65) received one initial intravitreal injection of 2 mg aflibercept. Further injections were based on CNV activity at monthly examinations. The primary endpoint was change of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change of central retinal thickness (CRT), leakage from CNV, retinal sensitivity, and vision-related quality of life.BCVA improved from 75.0 ± 10.8 (± SD, Snellen equivalent 20/32) to 79.3 ± 7.3 ETDRS letters (20/32) at final visit (p = 0.083). CRT decreased from 317 ± 81 to 279 ± 51 μm (p = 0.004). Retinal sensitivity on microperimetry changed from 17.8 ± 4.5 to 18.5 ± 4.3 dB (p = 0.103) and vision-related quality of life from a VQF-25 score of 80.7 ± 10.4 to 83.5 ± 14.5 (p = 0.554). The mean number of injections was 6.7 ± 2.6, and 5 participants had persistent or reactivated CNV activity at final visit. The observed adverse events were comparable with studies on aflibercept for other indications.The results of this study indicate that intravitreal aflibercept is a treatment option for CNV secondary to PXE."	"Legumes can utilize atmospheric nitrogen by hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria in special lateral root organs, called nodules. Legume nodules have a unique ontology, despite similarities in the gene networks controlling nodule and lateral root development. It has been shown that Medicago truncatula NODULE ROOT1 (MtNOOT1) is required for the maintenance of nodule identity, preventing the conversion to lateral root development. MtNOOT1 and its orthologs in other plant species -collectively called the NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE (NBCL) family- specify boundary formation in various aerial organs. However, MtNOOT1 is not only expressed in nodules and aerial organs, but also in developing roots, where its function remains elusive.We show that Mtnoot1 mutant seedlings display accelerated root elongation due to an enlarged root apical meristem. Also, Mtnoot1 mutant roots are thinner than wild-type and are delayed in xylem cell differentiation. We provide molecular evidence that the affected spatial development of Mtnoot1 mutant roots correlates with delayed induction of genes involved in xylem cell differentiation. This coincides with a basipetal shift of the root zone that is susceptible to rhizobium-secreted symbiotic signal molecules.Our data show that MtNOOT1 regulates the size of the root apical meristem and vascular differentiation. Our data demonstrate that MtNOOT1 not only functions as a homeotic gene in nodule development but also coordinates the spatial development of the root."	"Spiration Valve System (SVS) is an alternative for patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema; however, data about efficacy from randomized controlled trials (RCT) are unclear.To explore both efficacy and safety of SVS in patients with severe emphysema and hyperinflation.We included PubMed, EMBASE, Coch-rane database. All searches were performed until August 2019. Only RCTs were included for analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis evaluated change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), 6-min walking test (6MWT), residual volume, modified medical research council (mMRC) and Saint George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ), all-cause mortality, risk of pneumothorax, and risk of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Quality of the evidence was rated using GRADE approach.Four RCTs including 629 subjects were included. SVS showed an overall change of 0.03 L (-0.07 to 0.13, I2 = 90%) in the in FEV1 (L) and a 2.03% (-2.50 to 6.57, I2 = 96%) in the predicted FEV1 (%) compared to baseline; however, studies without collateral ventilation (CV) showed an improvement of 0.12 L (95% CI 0.09-0.015, I2 = 0%), This subgroup also reported better results in SGRQ -12.27 points (95% CI -15.84 to -8.70, I2 = 0%) and mMRC -0.54 (95% CI -0.74 to -0.33, I2 = 0%). We found no benefit in 6MWT mean difference = 4.56 m (95% CI -21.88 to 31.00, I2 = 73%). Relative risk of mortality was 2.54 (95% CI 0.81-7.96, I2 = 0%), for pneumothorax 3.3 (95% CI 0.61-18.12, I2 = 0%) and AECOPD 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.70, I2 = 0%).In patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation without CV, SVS is an alternative that showed an improvement in pulmonary function, quality of life, and dyspnea score with an acceptable risk profile."	"Therapeutic treatment of cocaine toxicity or addiction is a grand medical challenge. As a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of cocaine toxicity and addiction to develop a highly efficient cocaine hydrolase (CocH) capable of accelerating cocaine metabolism to produce physiologically/biologically inactive metabolites, our previously designed A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutant of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), known as cocaine hydrolase-1 (CocH1), possesses the desirably high catalytic activity against cocaine. The C-terminus of CocH1, truncated after amino acid #529, was fused to human serum albumin (HSA) to extend the biological half-life. The C-terminal HSA-fused CocH1 (CocH1-HSA), known as Albu-CocH1, Albu-CocH, AlbuBChE, Albu-BChE, or TV-1380 in literature, has shown favorable preclinical and clinical profiles. However, the actual therapeutic value of TV-1380 for cocaine addiction treatment is still limited by the short half-life. In this study, we designed and tested a new type of HSA-fused CocH1 proteins, i.e., N-terminal HSA-fused CocH1, with or without a linker between the HSA and CocH1 domains. It has been demonstrated that the catalytic activity of these new fusion proteins against cocaine is similar to that of TV-1380. However, HSA-CocH1 (without a linker) has a significantly longer biological half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 14 ± 2 h) compared to the corresponding C-terminal HSA-fused CocH1, i.e., CocH1-HSA (TV-1380 with t<sub>1/2</sub> = 5-8 h), in rats. Further, the N-terminal HSA-fused CocH1 proteins with a linker have further prolonged biological half-lives: t<sub>1/2</sub> = 17 ± 2 h for both HSA-EAAAK-CocH1 and HSA-PAPAP-CocH1, and t<sub>1/2</sub> = 18 ± 3 h for HSA-(PAPAP)<sub>2</sub>-CocH1. These N-terminal HSA-fused CocH1 proteins may serve as more promising protein drug candidates for cocaine addiction treatment."	"Treatment with interferon (IFN) has been associated with depressive side effects. Previous neuroimaging studies have provided information about changes in brain activation patterns in patients under treatment with IFN-alpha, but the effect of other IFNs, or the role of the underlying disease, has yet to be clarified. In the present fMRI study, we looked at brain changes after 8 days of IFN-beta treatment in N = =17 healthy volunteers, thus avoiding the possible confound of the effects of underlying pathology in studies of IFN-treated patients with neurological or other medical disorders. We followed a symptom dimensional approach by simultaneously investigating two distinct symptom domains of depressiveness: negative affect (amygdala) and appetitive motivation (ventral striatum). In these early phases of IFN treatment we detected a selective change in neural substrates of appetitive motivation, consistent with the predominant symptomatic change recorded in psychopathology ratings. In contrast, the fMRI phenotype of negative affect, which is known to characterize disorders of affect involving anxiety and depressiveness as well as individual vulnerability to depression, was unchanged after treatment. These findings suggest that IFN may induce an affective syndrome through a mechanism involving down-regulation of appetitive motivation."	"Pathogenic variants in COCH, encoding cochlin, cause DFNA9 deafness disorder with characteristic histopathologic findings of cochlin deposits in the inner and middle ears. Here, we present the first case of deafness associated with bilateral external auditory canal (EAC) cochlin deposits, previously unreported evidence suggestive of cochlin-derived amyloid formation, and a novel COCH variant. A 54-year-old woman presented with progressive sensorineural hearing loss and bilateral EAC narrowing by subcutaneous thickening. Excision and histologic evaluation of tissue from both EACs showed paucicellular eosinophilic aggregates containing multiple Congo red-positive foci with yellow and green birefringence under crossed polarization light microscopy. Mass spectrometry performed on both the Congo red-positive and Congo red-negative areas identified cochlin as the most abundant protein, as well as a low abundance of universal amyloid signature peptides only in the Congo red-positive areas. Peptides indicative of a canonical amyloid type were not detected. Electron microscopy showed haphazard, branched microfibrils (3-7 nm in diameter) consistent with cochlin, as well as swirling fibrils (10-24 nm in diameter) reminiscent of amyloid fibrils. Cochlin immunohistochemical staining showed positivity throughout the aggregates. Sequencing of the entire COCH gene coding region from the patient's blood revealed a novel variant resulting in a non-conservative amino acid substitution of isoleucine to phenylalanine (c.1621A&gt;T, p.I541F) in the vWFA2 domain at the protein's C-terminus. Our findings reveal a new pathologic manifestation of cochlin, raise the possibility of previously undescribed cochlin-derived amyloid formation, and highlight the importance of thoroughly investigating all aggregative tissue findings in the practice of diagnostic pathology."	"The CeTeG/NOA-09 trial showed significantly longer overall survival with combined lomustine-temozolomide therapy compared with standard temozolomide for patients with glioblastoma with methylated MGMT promoter. The trial also aimed to investigate the effect of lomustine-temozolomide therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and neurocognitive function, which we report here.In this randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial, newly diagnosed, chemoradiotherapy-naive patients with MGMT-methylated glioblastoma, aged 18-70 years, with a Karnofsky performance score of 70% or higher, were recruited and enrolled at 17 university hospitals in Germany. Patients received standard radiotherapy (60 Gy) and were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by centre by allocating complete blocks of six to a centre, without masking) to either six 6-week courses of oral combined lomustine (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) plus temozolomide (100-200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 2-6) or standard oral temozolomide (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily during radiotherapy plus six 4-week courses of temozolomide [150-200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>] on days 1-5, every 4 weeks). The primary endpoint was overall survival. HRQOL, assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire core-30 and the EORTC brain cancer module (BN20); and neurocognitive function, assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), plus a neurocognitive test battery (NOA-07), including Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A and B), working memory tests, and tests for lexical (Controlled Oral Word Association [COWA]) and semantic verbal fluency, were secondary endpoints analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (mITT; all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study chemotherapy). We used linear mixed-model analyses to investigate differences between treatment groups regarding HRQOL (clinically relevant ≥10 points) and MMSE scores (clinically relevant ≥3 points). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01149109.Between June 17, 2011 and April 8, 2014, 141 patients were randomly assigned and 129 patients began treatment and were included in the mITT population (63 in the temozolomide and 66 in the lomustine-temozolomide group). Median follow-up for HRQOL (the item global health) was 19·4 months (IQR 7·8-38·6), for MMSE was 15·3 months (4·1-29·6), and for COWA was 11·0 months (0-27·5). We found no significant impairment regarding any item of HRQOL in the lomustine-temozolomide group (difference between the groups for global health 0·30 [95% CI -0·23 to 0·83]; p=0·26). Differences in MMSE were in favour of the temozolomide group (difference -0·11 [95% CI -0·19 to -0·03]; p=0·0058) but were not clinically relevant (1·76/30 points over 4 years). We found no significant difference between the groups in any subtest of the neurocognitive test battery (difference for COWA 0·04 [95% CI -0·01 to 0·09]; p=0·14).The absence of systematic and clinically relevant changes in HRQOL and neurocognitive function combined with the survival benefit of lomustine-temozolomide versus temozolomide alone suggests that a long-term net clinical benefit exists for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylation of the MGMT promoter and supports the use of lomustine-temozolomide as a treatment option for these patients.German Federal Ministry of Education and Research."	"The emulsification properties of the standard (STD), matured (EM2 and EM10) and fractionated gum arabic samples via phase separation induced molecular fractionation were investigated to find out how the content of arabinogalactan protein (AGP) complex affects the resulting emulsion properties. Phase separation and the accompanying molecular fractionation were induced by mixing with different hydrocolloids including hyaluronan (HA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and maltodextrin (MD). Increase of AGP content from 11 to 28% resulted in the formation of emulsions with relatively smaller droplet sizes and better stability. Further increase in the AGP content to 41% resulted in the formation of emulsions with larger droplets. In spite of the larger droplets sizes, these emulsions were extremely stable. In addition, the emulsions prepared with GA higher AGP content better stability in the presence of ethanol. The results indicate that AGP content plays a vital role in emulsion stability and droplet size."	"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of speed training on sprint step kinematics and performance in male sprinters. Two groups of seven elite (best 100-m time: 10.37 ± 0.04 s) and seven sub-elite (best 100-m time: 10.71 ± 0.15 s) sprinters were recruited. Sprint performance was assessed in the 20 m (flying start), 40 m (standing start), and 60 m (starting block start). Step kinematics were extracted from the first nine running steps of the 20-m sprint using the Opto-Jump-Microgate system. Explosive power was quantified by performing the CMJ, standing long jump, standing triple jump, and standing five jumps. Significant post-test improvements (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were observed in both groups of sprinters. Performance improved by 0.11 s (elite) and 0.06 s (sub-elite) in the 20-m flying start and by 0.06 s (elite) and 0.08 s (sub-elite) in the 60-m start block start. Strong post-test correlations were observed between 60-m block start performance and standing five jumps (SFJ) in the elite group and between 20-m flying start and 40-m standing start performance and standing long jump (SLJ) and standing triple jump (STJ) in the sub-elite group. Speed training (ST) shows potential in the reduction of step variability and as an effective short-term intervention program in the improvement of sprint performance."	NA
"EYA4"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"The mutational spectrum of many genes and their contribution to the global prevalence of hereditary hearing loss is still widely unknown. In this study, we have performed the mutational screening of EYA4 gene by DHLPC and NGS in a large cohort of 531 unrelated Spanish probands and one Australian family with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). In total, 9 novel EYA4 variants have been identified, 3 in the EYA4 variable region (c.160G &gt; T; p.Glu54*, c.781del; p.Thr261Argfs*34 and c.1078C &gt; A; p.Pro360Thr) and 6 in the EYA-HR domain (c.1107G &gt; T; p.Glu369Asp, c.1122G &gt; T; p.Trp374Cys, c.1281G &gt; A; p.Glu427Glu, c.1282-1G &gt; A, c.1601C &gt; G; p.S534* and an heterozygous copy number loss encompassing exons 15 to 17). The contribution of EYA4 mutations to ADNSHL in Spain is, therefore, very limited (~1.5%, 8/531). The pathophysiology of some of these novel variants has been explored. Transient expression of the c-myc-tagged EYA4 mutants in mammalian COS7 cells revealed absence of expression of the p.S534* mutant, consistent with a model of haploinsufficiency reported for all previously described EYA4 truncating mutations. However, normal expression pattern and translocation to the nucleus were observed for the p.Glu369Asp mutant in presence of SIX1. Complementary in silico analysis suggested that c.1107G &gt; T (p.Glu369Asp), c.1281G &gt; A (p.Glu427Glu) and c.1282-1G &gt; A variants alter normal splicing. Minigene assays in NIH3T3 cells further confirmed that all 3 variants caused exon skipping resulting in frameshifts that lead to premature stop codons. Our study reports the first likely pathogenic synonymous variant linked to DFNA10 and provide further evidence for haploinsufficiency as the common underlying disease-causing mechanism for DFNA10-related hearing loss."	"Variants in the EYA4 gene are known to lead to autosomal dominant non-syndromic hereditary hearing loss, DFNA10. To date, 30 variants have been shown to be responsible for hearing loss in a diverse set of nationalities. To better understand the clinical characteristics and prevalence of DFNA10, we performed genetic screening for EYA4 mutations in a large cohort of Japanese hearing loss patients. We selected 1,336 autosomal dominant hearing loss patients among 7,408 unrelated Japanese hearing loss probands and performed targeted genome enrichment and massively parallel sequencing of 68 target genes for all patients. Clinical information of cases with mutations in EYA4 was gathered and analyzed from medical charts. Eleven novel EYA4 variants (three frameshift variants, three missense variants, two nonsense variants, one splicing variant, and two single-copy number losses) and two previously reported variants were found in 12 probands (0.90%) among the 1,336 autosomal dominant hearing loss families. The audiometric configuration of truncating variants tends to deteriorate for all frequencies, whereas that of non-truncating variants tends to show high-frequency hearing loss, suggesting a new correlation between genotype and phenotype in DFNA10. The rate of hearing loss progression caused by EYA4 variants was considered to be 0.63 dB/year, as found in this study and previous reports."	"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) has recently been confirmed as a common complex trait, that is, it is heritable with many genetic variants each contributing a small amount of risk, as well as environmental determinants. Historically, attempts to identify the genetic variants underlying the ARHL have been of limited success, relying on the selection of candidate genes based on the limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of the condition, and linkage studies in samples comprising related individuals. More recently genome-wide association studies have been performed, but these require very large samples having consistent and reliable phenotyping for hearing loss (HL), and early attempts suffered from lack of reliable replication of their findings. Replicated variants shown associated with ARHL include those lying in genes GRM7, ISG20, TRIOBP, ILDR1, and EYA4. The availability of large biobanks and the development of collaborative consortia have led to a breakthrough over the last couple of years, and many new genetic variants associated with ARHL are becoming available, through the analysis publicly available bioresources and electronic health records. These findings along with immunohistochemistry and mouse models of HL look set to help disentangle the genetic architecture of ARHL, and highlight the need for standardization of phenotyping methods to facilitate data sharing and collaboration across research networks."	"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Our previous study showed that EYA4 functioned by suppressing growth of HCC tumor cells, but its molecular mechanism is still not elucidated. Based on the results of gene microassay, EYA4 was inversely correlated with MYCBP and was verified in human HCC tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Overexpressed and KO EYA4 in human HCC cell lines confirmed the negative correlation between EYA4 and MYCBP by qRT-PCR and western blot. Transfected siRNA of MYCBP in EYA4 overexpressed cells and overexpressed MYCBP in EYA4 KO cells could efficiently rescue the proliferation and G2/M arrest effects of EYA4 on HCC cells. Mechanistically, armed with serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase activity, EYA4 reduced nuclear translocation of β-catenin by dephosphorylating β-catenin at Ser552, thereby suppressing the transcription of MYCBP which was induced by β-catenin/LEF1 binding to the promoter of MYCBP. Clinically, HCC patients with highly expressed EYA4 and poorly expressed MYCBP had significantly longer disease-free survival and overall survival than HCC patients with poorly expressed EYA4 and highly expressed MYCBP. In conclusion, EYA4 suppressed HCC tumor cell growth by repressing MYCBP by dephosphorylating β-catenin S552. EYA4 combined with MYCBP could be potential prognostic biomarkers in HCC."	"We report on a 34-year-old woman and her mother who both have clinical features suggestive for otofaciocervical syndrome (OTFCS), a disorder characterized by a combination of facial dysmorphisms, ear abnormalities with hearing loss, and shoulder girdle anomalies. OTFCS presents overlapping features with branchiootorenal spectrum disorders, including branchiootorenal syndrome and branchiootic syndrome. These disorders have been described as clinically distinct entities, but molecular studies have shown that all the causative genes belong to the Pax-Six-Eya-Dach network (PSEDN). So far, the genetic diagnosis of OTFCS has been performed only in very few cases and involves two genes, EYA1 and PAX1; thus, it is likely that other genes have still to be identified. In the present patient, array CGH analysis showed a 3.7-Mb deletion in 6q23; a smaller 1.9-Mb deletion in the same region was detected in her mother. The minimal overlapping region harbors the <i>EYA4</i> gene. The cases here described are interesting, since they all showed the typical clinical features of OTFCS, associated with a deletion in 6q23.2. Even if we cannot exclude the contribution of other genes to the phenotype, EYA4 is a good candidate for OTFCS according to its pattern of expression, its sequence similarity to <i>EYA1</i>, and its involvement in PSEDN."	"Keshan disease (KD) is an endemic cardiomyopathy with high mortality. Selenium (Se) deficiency is closely related to KD, while magnesium (Mg) plays many critical roles in the cardiovascular function. The molecular mechanism of KD pathogenesis is still unclear. Until now, we have not found any studies investigating the association between Se- or Mg-related genes and KD. In this study, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells between KD patients and normal controls. Next, human metabolome database (HMDB) was used to screen Se- and Mg-related genes. Function classification, gene pathway, and interaction network of Se- and Mg-related genes in KD peripheral blood mononuclear cells were defined by FunRich (functional enrichment analysis tool). Among 83 differentially expressed genes, five Se-related (DIO2, GPX1, GPX2, GPX4, and GPX7) and five Mg-related (ACSL6, EYA4, IDH2, PPM1A, and STK11) genes were recognized from HMDB. Two significant biological processes (energy pathways and metabolism), one molecular function (peroxidase activity), one biological pathway (glutathione redox reactions I), and one gene interaction network were constituted from Se-related and Mg-related genes. Se-related gene DIO2 and Mg-related genes STK11 and IDH2 may have key roles in the myocardial dysfunction of KD. However, we still have not obtained any interaction between Se-related gene and Mg-related gene. The interactions between RPS6KB1, PTEN, ATM, HSP90AA1, SNRK, PRKAA2, SMARCA4, HSPA1A, and STK11 may play important roles in the abnormal cardiac function of KD."	"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been considered to mediate occurrence and development of human cancers, generally acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate downstream genes expression. However, the aberrant expression profile and dysfunction of circRNAs in human bladder cancer remain to be investigated. The present study aims to elucidate the potential role and molecular mechanism of circACVR2A in regulating the proliferation and metastasis of bladder cancer.circACVR2A (hsa_circ_0001073) was identified by RNA-sequencing and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis. The role of circACVR2A in bladder cancer was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. Biotin-coupled probe pull down assay, biotin-coupled microRNA capture, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and fluorescence in situ hybridization were conducted to evaluate the interaction between circACVR2A and microRNAs.The expression of circACVR2A was lower in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. The down-regulation of circACVR2A was positively correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics, and circACVR2A served as an independent risk factor for overall survival in bladder cancer patients after cystectomy. Our in vivo and in vitro data indicated that circACVR2A suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically, we found that circACVR2A could directly interact with miR-626 and act as a miRNA sponge to regulate EYA4 expression.circACVR2A functions as a tumor suppressor to inhibit bladder cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through miR-626/EYA4 axis, suggesting that circACVR2A is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for bladder cancer."	"Progressive bilateral sensorineural deafness in postlingual period may be linked to many different etiologies including genetic factors. Identification of the exact deafness cause may, therefore, be quite challenging. Here we present a family with late-onset hearing loss as an autosomal dominant trait caused by a novel EYA4 mutation.Forty-four years old female proband clinically investigated for progressive hearing loss and occasional dizziness with positive family history for deafness was subject to molecular-genetic testing. Patient's DNA sample was analyzed by whole exome sequencing. We identified a novel missense variant c.804G &gt; C located at the last base pair of exon 10 in EYA4. Candidate variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband and her family members. In silico prediction tools and co-segregation analysis were used to indicate pathogenicity of the identified variant. To confirm our hypothesis, we performed minigene assay to demonstrate if the transcript of exon 10 in EYA4 is present. We provide evidence that this mutation in vitro compromises donor site functionality and causes exon 10 skipping and frameshift that most likely results in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The onset of moderate to severe hearing loss in the family ranged from 10 to 40 years. The normal cardiac phenotype was confirmed by ECG and echocardiography.We identified a novel EYA4 mutation associated with adult-onset autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss. This report extends the knowledge of spectrum of EYA4 mutations and demonstrates the pathogenicity of a variant affecting specific position in the gene. A comprehensive review of known EYA4 mutations is also given and their impact on cardiac phenotype is discussed. Our findings highlight the importance of genetic testing and complex clinical assessment in patients with familial progressive hearing loss."	"Eye absent homolog 4 (EYA4) has been demonstrated to be down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its biological function and the mechanism in HCC angiogenesis and metastasis remain largely unknown. Herein, we showed that EYA4 expression was frequently low in HCC tissue samples compared with matched adjacent non-tumourous tissues. In the analysis of 302 HCC specimens, we revealed that decreased expression of EYA4 correlated with tumour differentiation status. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified EYA4 as an independent risk factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) among the 302 patients. Functional assays showed that forced expression of EYA4 suppressed HCC cell migration, invasion and capillary tube formation of endothelial cells in vitro, as well as in vivo tumour angiogenesis and metastasis in a mouse model. Furthermore, mechanism study exhibited that EYA4 could inhibit HCC angiogenesis and metastasis by inhibiting c-JUN/VEGFA pathway. Together, we provide proof that EYA4 is a novel tumour suppressor in HCC and a new prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC."	"The aim of this study was to screen for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to construct genetic risk prediction models for NIHL in a Chinese population.Four hundred seventy-six subjects with NIHL and 476 matched controls were recruited from a cross-sectional survey on NIHL in China. A total of 83 candidate SNPs were genotyped using nanofluidic dynamic arrays on a Fluidigm platform. NIHL-associated SNPs were screened with a multiple logistic model, and a genetic risk model was constructed based on the genetic risk score (GRS). The results were validated using a prospective cohort population.Seven SNPs in the CDH23, PCDH15, EYA4, MYO1A, KCNMA1, and OTOG genes were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with the risk of NIHL, whereas seven other SNPs were marginally (P &gt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.1) associated with the risk of NIHL. A positive correlation was observed between GRS values and odds ratio (OR) for NIHL. Two SNPs, namely, rs212769 and rs7910544, were validated in the cohort study. Subjects with higher GRS (≧9) showed a higher risk of NIHL incidence with an OR of 2.00 (95% CI = 1.04, 3.86).Genetic susceptibility plays an important role in the incidence of NIHL. GRS values, which are based on NIHL-associated SNPs. GRS may be utilized in the evaluation of genetic risk for NIHL and in the determination of NIHL susceptibility."	"The aim of this study was to identify the novel missense eya4 mutation which cause autosomal dominant non syndromic hearing loss In a Chinese family. Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans, but the middle-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (MFSNHL) is rare among hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss, and EYA4 is one of the genes reported to be associated with MFSNHL. A genetic analysis of a Chinese family with autosomal dominant non‑syndromic progressive hearing impairment was conducted and assessed. Targeted exome sequencing, conducted using DNA samples of an affected member in this family, revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.1855T&amp;gt;G in exon 20 of EYA4, causing amino-acid (aa) substitution Gly for Trp at a conserved position aa-619. The p.W619G mutation related to hearing loss in this Chinese family was validated by Sanger sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed the pathogenic effects of this mutation. We identified the novel missense mutation c.1855T&amp;gt;G (p.W619G) in EYA4 causing autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment in the selected Chinese family."	"To study the genetic etiology of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) in a Chinese family and perform a literature review of OTOF mutations and cochlear implantation (CI).Sequential targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and CI was performed for the proband. Further, 50 DNA samples from unrelated families with nonsyndromic deafness were examined for frequency determination. The impact of OTOF mutations on hearing recovery after CI was assessed through the literature survey.In the proband, the targeted NGS panel revealed five suspected variants in four genes (OTOF, EYA4, PCDH15, and GIPC3), of which two mutations-c.5098G &gt; C (p.Glu1700Gln) and c.1702C &gt; T (p.Arg568Trp)-in the OTOF gene were found to be correlated with ANSD. The c.5098G &gt; C allele was identified in only one child from the 50 unrelated participants. The proband's hearing and speech abilities were restored 2 years after the surgery. Most ANSD patients (90.9%; 30/33) with OTOF mutations have acceptable surgical outcomes, as indicated by existing reports.Our results support the feasibility of CI for patients with ANSD and OTOF mutations, and this hypothesis was supported by the review of existing data. A larger number of cases studies is required to determine possible modifies on the prognosis of surgery."	"Accumulating evidence suggests that Eyes Absent Homologue 4 (EYA4) plays an important role in tumorigenesis and progression of various cancers. However, the role of EYA4 in glioma development is still unclear.The expression of EYA4 was examined in glioma tissues by immunohistochemistry. Cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed by CCK-8, BrdU assay, and flow cytometry.We found that EYA4 was upregulated in glioma, and its expression was positively correlated with advanced tumor stage. Moreover, higher expression of EYA4 predicted a worse overall survival in patients with glioma. Forced overexpression of EYA4 enhanced glioma cell proliferation, and EYA4 suppressed the expression of p27Kip1 directly in these cells. Furthermore, Six1 was required for EYA4 to suppress the expression of p27Kip1 in glioma.Together, we demonstrate that EYA4 promotes cell proliferation by directly suppressing the expression of p27Kip1 in glioma."	"<i>EYA4</i> is a member of the vertebrate <i>eya</i> gene family of transcriptional activators and plays several roles in both embryonic and inner ear development. The majority of <i>EYA4</i> gene mutations are associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNA10). In addition, some mutations in this gene cause autosomal dominant syndromic hearing loss with dilated cardiomyopathy. <i>EYA4</i> is a rare cause of sensorineural hearing loss, and only a limited number of papers regarding mutations in this gene have been published. Thus, detailed clinical features remain unclear. We conducted next-generation sequencing of a Japanese individual with progressive sensorineural hearing loss and identified an <i>EYA4</i> pathogenic variant. Pure-tone audiometry revealed bilateral, nearly symmetric, moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low and middle frequencies. Minor abnormalities were observed on the patient's electrocardiogram and echocardiography without any apparent symptoms. Next-generation sequencing is effective in elucidating the etiology of hearing loss, and the present findings suggested the possible phenotypic expansion of deafness caused by <i>EYA4</i> gene mutations."	"The purpose of this overview is to increase clinician awareness of the genetic basis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the benefits of early diagnosis and management to individuals with genetic DCM. The following are the goals of this overview. GOAL 1: Define DCM. GOAL 2: Identify the categories of DCM. GOAL 3: Provide the evaluation strategy of a proband with nonsyndromic DCM. GOAL 4: Provide a basic view of genetic risk assessment of at-risk asymptomatic relatives of a proband with DCM to inform cardiac surveillance and allow early detection and treatment of DCM to improve long-term outcome."	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss has been shown to have high genetic heterogeneity. In this report, we aimed to disclose the genetic causes of the subjects from the ten Chinese deaf families who did not have pathogenic common genes/mutation. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 142 known deafness genes was performed in the probands of ten families followed by cosegregation analysis of all family members. We identified novel pathogenic variants in six families including p.D1806E/p.R1588W, p.R964W/p.R1588W, and p.G17C/p.G1449D in <i>CDH23</i>; p.T584M/p.D1939N in <i>LOXHD1</i>; p.P1225L in <i>MYO7A</i>; and p.K612X in <i>EYA4</i>. Sanger sequencing confirmed that these mutations segregated with the hearing loss of each family. In four families, no pathogenic variants were identified. Our study provided better understanding of the mutation spectrum of hearing loss in the Chinese population."	"The risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the colon. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of selected methylation gene panel for the early detection of CRC in high-risk IBD patients.In a discovery phase, 73 biopsies of 48 IBD patients (associated or not to CRC) were analyzed from genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the Illumina Human Methylation 450K BeadChip. The panel of 5 genes selected (EYA4, SLIT2, FLI1, USP44, and SND1) was validated prospectively using methylation-specific melting curve analysis in biopsies of diseased and adjacent healthy tissue of 203 patients: 38 with IBD and associated neoplasia, 81 patients with IBD (25 of them with high risk), 48 with sporadic CRC, and 36 healthy controls.The prevalence of methylation was higher in patients with IBD and associated neoplasia (both in diseased and adjacent healthy tissue, 71% and 52%, respectively) than in healthy controls (2/36, 6%; P = 6.72E-05). Methylation in IBD patients at high risk of dysplasia or cancer was more frequently detected than in patients at low risk (92% vs 57%; odds ratio, 8.63; P = 0.001). EYA4 and SLIT2 were the markers most frequently methylated. Differences in methylation levels were more evident in healthy mucosa (82% vs 15% high vs low risk, respectively; P = 1.25E-05).Analysis of this panel of methylation markers may help in the early identification of colorectal dysplasia or cancer in high-risk IBD patients."	"Our previous studies demonstrated that eyes absent homolog 4 (EYA4), a member of the eye development-related EYA family in Drosophila, is frequently methylated and silenced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and associated with shorter survival. The current work aimed to explore the mechanisms through which EYA4 functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC.Stable EYA4-expressing plasmid (pEYA4) transfectants of the human HCC cell lines Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 (PLC) were established. Xenografts tumors were established via subcutaneous injection of the stable transfectants into BALB/c nude mice. Tissue samples were obtained from 75 pathologically diagnosed HCC patients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the expression of EYA4 in cell lines, xenografts and clinical specimens. The cell proliferation, colony formation, invasiveness and tumor formation of stable transfectants were studied. A gene expression microarray was utilized to screen genes regulated by EYA4 expression. The effect of EYA4 on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/RAS-related protein 1 (RAP1) signaling was demonstrated through the co-transfection of pEYA4 and Flag-tagged RAS-related protein 1A gene-expressing plasmid (Flag-RAP1A), functional studies, chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence staining and cellular ubiquitination assay.The restoration of EYA4 expression in HCC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, inhibited clonogenic outgrowth, reduced cell invasion and restrained xenograft tumor growth, and Flag-RAP1A reversed the suppressive effects of pEYA4 in vitro. Activation of NF-κB with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) increased the binding of p65 to the RAP1A gene promoter and up-regulated RAP1 protein expression. The inhibition of NF-κB with BAY 11-7085 and p65 siRNA successfully blocked TNF-α-induced RAP1 up-regulation. EYA4 antagonized the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα) as well as the nuclear translocation and transactivation of p65, resulting in repressed NF-κB activity and RAP1 expression. Blocking the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of EYA4 with calyculin A notably abrogated its suppressive effect on NF-κB activity. In addition, EYA4 expression was inversely correlated with IκBα/RAP1 activity in clinical HCC specimens.Our findings provide a functional and mechanistic basis for identifying EYA4 as a bona fide tumor suppressor that disrupts aberrant activation of the NF-κB/RAP1 signaling pathway and thus orchestrates a physiological impediment to HCC growth and invasion."	"EYA4, one of the four members of the EYA gene family, is associated with several human cancers. However, its biological functions and molecular mechanisms in the progression of cancer, particularly in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), remain unknown. In the present study, we found that EYA4 was underexpressed and hypermethylated in most of the ESCC cell lines tested (85.7%, 6/7). Treatment with 5-aza-dC and/or trichostatin A (TSA) restored EYA4 expression in ESCC cell lines, which indicates that EYA4 expression was epigenetically regulated. Similarly, EYA4 was aberrantly hypermethylated in ESCC tissues (78%, 39/50) and downregulation of EYA4 occurred in approximately 65% of primary ESCC at protein level where it was associated significantly with TNM stage and lymph node metastases. Knockdown of EYA4 in KYSE30 and KYSE70 ESCC cells using small hairpin RNA increased migration and invasive motility in vitro. Conversely, the overexpression of EYA4 in KYSE180 and KYSE450 promoted an epithelial phenotype, which consisted of decreased migration and invasion abilities and a decrease in TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, EYA4 overexpression reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β, which led to the inactivation of slug. In addition, we found that TGF-β1 decreased EYA4 expression in both a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner in KYSE30 cells, accompanied by an increase in the expression of DNA methyltransferases, especially DNMT3A. In summary, EYA4 is frequently hypermethylated in ESCC and may function as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of ESCC."	"The aim of this study was to investigate whether hypermethylation of Eyes Absent 4 (EYA4) is also implicated in Iranian Colorectal Cancer (CRC) patients or not. From fresh frozen tissues, samples from 38 paired (cancer and normal) CRC tissue specimens were used in this study, the DNA was isolated, sodium bisulfite treated and analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase (MSP) chain reaction using primers specific for unmethylated or methylated promoter sequences of the EYA4 gene. We also analyzed EYA4 mRNA expression using real time RT-PCR. Demographic characteristics of these patients including age, sex, tumor grade, location, stage, and TNM classification were evaluated and the relationship between methylation status of the gene and clinicopathological features was analyzed. Current study indicated that EYA4 promoter hypermethylation has a sensitivity of 81.57% and specificity of 78.94%. Findings showed lower expression of EYA-4 in methylated samples in comparison with its normal adjacent tissue, although it was not significant (P&gt;0.05). No significant associations were observed between EYA4 hypermethylation and the clinicopathological characteristics. Although the clinical patient outcome of our 38 CRC patients was not associated with EYA4 promoter hypermethylation, the high frequency of this methylation and its high sensitivity and specificity to neoplastic cells may qualify EYA4 promoter methylation as a potential candidate screening marker in Iranian population and may help to improve early detection of CRC."
"GRHL2"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) serves as the most common subtype of liver diseases and cause of liver dysfunction, which is closely related to obesity and insulin resistance. In our study, we sought to investigate effect of transcription factor grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) on NAFLD and the relevant mechanism. NAFLD mouse model was established with a high-fat feed. Then, serum was extracted from NAFLD patients and mice, followed by ectopic expression and depletion experiments in NAFLD mice and L02 cells. Next, the correlation between GRHL2 and microRNA (miR)-200 and between miR-200 and sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) was evaluated. The observations demonstrated that miR-200 and GRHL2 were overexpressed in the serum of NAFLD patients and mice, while SIRT1 was poorly expressed. GRHL2 positively regulated miR-200 by binding to miR-200 promoter region, which negatively targeted SIRT1. The inhibition of miR-200 and GRHL2 or SIRT1 overexpression lowered HA and LN in mouse liver tissue, occludin and ZO-1 in mouse small intestine tissue, TNF-α and IL-6 in mouse serum, glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in mouse serum, and also inhibited liver fibrosis and intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. Meanwhile, GRHL2 induced activation of MAPK signalling pathway in NAFLD mice. Collectively, GRHL2 played a contributory role in NAFLD by exacerbating liver fibrosis and intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction with the involvement of miR-200-dependent SIRT1 and the MAPK signalling pathway."	"GRHL2 played important roles in different cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of GRHL2 in bladder cancer.The immunohistochemistry assay was performed to detect the expression of GRHL2 in bladder cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues and the expression levels of GRHL2 and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB1) mRNA in tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. In addition, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were applied to detect the expression levels of GRHL2 and ZEB1 in bladder cancer cell lines (RT4, BIU-87, 5637, T24) and immortalized human bladder epithelial cell line (SV-HUC-1). The cell models with up-regulated and down-regulated expression of GRHL2 were constructed using bladder cancer cell lines T24 and 5637 to investigate the underlying roles of GRHL2 on the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT process of bladder cancer cells. After that, cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK8 assay, cell cycle assay and colony formation assay. Transwell assay and wound healing assay were performed to determine the invasion and migration ability of the bladder cancer cells. The expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related proteins (E-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug and Snail) were assessed by Western blot analysis. Moreover, ZEB1 and GRHL2 were co-transfected into T24 and 5637 cells and their effects on EMT process and invasive capacity of cells were examined.The expression of GRHL2 was down-regulated in bladder cancer tissues and human bladder cancer cell lines compared with the normal bladder tissues and immortalized human bladder epithelial cell line. Besides, down-regulation of GRHL2 improved the proliferation ability of bladder cancer cells and promoted the EMT process through up-regulation of ZEB1. The overexpression of ZEB1 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of GRHL2 on EMT.GRHL2 acts as an anti-oncogene to regulate bladder cancer cell proliferation and inhibit EMT by targeting ZEB1. This study may provide a theoretical basis for further research."	"As high-throughput sequencing is increasingly applied to the molecular diagnosis of rare Mendelian disorders, a large number of patients with diverse phenotypes have their genetic and phenotypic data pooled together to uncover new gene-phenotype relations. We introduce Phenogenon, a statistical tool that combines, Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) annotated patient phenotypes, gnomAD allele population frequency, and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score for variant pathogenicity, in order to jointly predict the mode of inheritance and gene-phenotype associations. We ran Phenogenon on our cohort of 3,290 patients who had undergone whole exome sequencing. Among the top associations, we recapitulated previously known, such as &quot;SRD5A3-Abnormal full-field electroretinogram-recessive&quot; and &quot;GRHL2 -Nail dystrophy-recessive&quot;, and discovered one potentially novel, &quot;RRAGA-Abnormality of the skin-dominant&quot;. We also developed an interactive web interface available at https://phenogenon.phenopolis.org to visualise and explore the results."	"Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), one of the three homologs of <i>Drosophila</i> grainyhead, contributes to epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation. Dysregulation of GRHL2 has been shown to be involved in hearing loss and neural tube defects during embryogenesis. Moreover, it is well-recognized that GRHL2 suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is required for migration and invasion of carcinoma, implicating, GRHL2 in carcinogenesis. Diverse mechanisms, as well as the varied roles of GRHL2 in different tumor tissues, have been elucidated. However, the functions of GRHL2 appear to be more complicated than initially thought. GRHL2, acting as either a tumor enhancer or a tumor inhibitor, depends on the type of cancer. In this review, we summarize research progress about normal physiological functions of GRHL2 including epithelial morphogenesis, neural tube closure, and hearing loss. Moreover, the mechanisms of GRHL2 in tumorigenesis, containing EMT suppression, forming a negative feedback loop with ZEB1 and miR200 family, interactions with estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent signaling pathway, regulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase and relationships with TGF-beta signaling pathway are discussed in this review in an effort to better understand the roles of GRHL2 in a variety of cancers toward the goal of GRHL2-targeted treatment in the near future."	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. In this study, we characterized the clinical features of 12 Chinese Han deaf families in which mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1 were excluded.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 147 known deafness genes was performed in probands of 10 families, while whole-exome sequencing was applied in those of the rest two.Pathogenic mutations in a total of 11 rare deafness genes, OTOF, CDH23, PCDH15, PDZD7, ADGRV1, KARS, OTOG, GRXCR2, MYO6, GRHL2, and POU3F4, were identified in all 12 probands, with 16 mutations being novel. Intrafamilial cosegregation of the mutations and the deafness phenotype were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Our results expanded the mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation of nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese Hans and also emphasized the importance of combining both next-generation sequencing and detailed auditory evaluation to achieve a more accurate diagnosis for nonsyndromic hearing loss."	"Cleft lip and palate are common birth defects resulting from failure of the facial processes to fuse during development. The mammalian grainyhead-like (<i>Grhl1-3</i>) genes play key roles in a number of tissue fusion processes including neurulation, epidermal wound healing and eyelid fusion. One family member, <i>Grhl2</i>, is expressed in the epithelial lining of the first pharyngeal arch in mice at embryonic day (E)10.5, prompting analysis of the role of this factor in palatogenesis. <i>Grhl2</i>-null mice die at E11.5 with neural tube defects and a cleft face phenotype, precluding analysis of palatal fusion at a later stage of development. However, in the first pharyngeal arch of <i>Grhl2</i>-null embryos, dysregulation of transcription factors that drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs. The aberrant expression of these genes is associated with a shift in RNA-splicing patterns that favours the generation of mesenchymal isoforms of numerous regulators. Driving the EMT perturbation is loss of expression of the EMT-suppressing transcription factors <i>Ovol1</i> and <i>Ovol2</i>, which are direct GRHL2 targets. The expression of the miR-200 family of microRNAs, also GRHL2 targets, is similarly reduced, resulting in a 56-fold upregulation of <i>Zeb1</i> expression, a major driver of mesenchymal cellular identity. The critical role of GRHL2 in mediating cleft palate in <i>Zeb1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice is evident, with rescue of both palatal and facial fusion seen in <i>Grhl2<sup>-/-</sup>;Zeb1<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos. These findings highlight the delicate balance between GRHL2/ZEB1 and epithelial/mesenchymal cellular identity that is essential for normal closure of the palate and face. Perturbation of this pathway may underlie cleft palate in some patients."	"Preeclampsia (PE) is a prevalent pregnancy disorder that has been one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently considered as important regulators in PE pathogenesis. In the current study, we aimed to explore the impact and mechanisms of circRNA zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 20 (circZDHHC20) in PE pathogenesis.RNase R assay and reverse transcription with Oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> primers were performed to confirm that circZDHHC20 was indeed circular transcript. The expression of circZDHHC20, grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) and miR-144 were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Subcellular localization assay was used to determine whether circZDHHC20 was predominantly present in the cytoplasm. The target correlations between miR-144 and circZDHHC20 or GRHL2 were confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr-azolium (MTS), wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Western blot was used for the quantification of GRHL2 protein level.Our data indicated that circZDHHC20 was up-regulated and miR-144 was down-regulated in PE placenta. CircZDHHC20 sequestered miR-144 by acting as a miR-144 sponge. CircZDHHC20 overexpression repressed trophoblast cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown exerted opposite effects. Moreover, miR-144 mediated the regulation of circZDHHC20 on trophoblast cell behaviors. GRHL2 was directly targeted and inhibited by miR-144. MiR-144 exerted regulatory effects on trophoblast cell proliferation, migration and invasion by GRHL2. Furthermore, circZDHHC20 modulated GRHL2 expression through sponging miR-144.Our study suggested that a high level of circZDHHC20 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion in trophoblast cells at least partially through sponging miR-144 and up-regulating GRHL2, providing a novel mechanism of PE pathogenesis."	"<b>Aim:</b> To identify methylation-associated genes in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). <b>Materials &amp; methods:</b> Genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were determined and further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas data and Chinese CRC patients, respectively. Gene overexpression and knockdown cells were constructed to investigate their biological roles in CRC. <b>Results:</b> After validations, hypermethylation of eight genes were found to be correlated with their reduced transcription, and hypomethyaltion of three genes were associated with their upregulation. <i>CADM3</i>, <i>CNRIP1</i>, <i>GRHL2</i>, <i>GRIA4</i>, <i>GSTM2</i> and <i>NRXN1</i> were associated with the overall survival of CRC patients. <i>CNRIP1</i> and <i>GSTM2</i> were mainly responsible for the proliferation in CRC cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> A total of 11 genes may be promising biomarkers for CRC."	"The highly-conserved Grainyhead-like (Grhl) transcription factors are critical regulators of embryogenesis that regulate cellular survival, proliferation, migration and epithelial integrity, especially during the formation of the craniofacial skeleton. Family member Grhl2 is expressed throughout epithelial tissues during development, and loss of Grhl2 function leads to significant defects in neurulation, abdominal wall closure, formation of the face and fusion of the maxilla/palate. Whereas numerous downstream target genes of Grhl2 have been identified, very little is known about how this crucial developmental transcription factor itself is regulated. Here, using in silico and in utero expression analyses and functional deletion in mice, we have identified a novel 2.4 ​kb enhancer element (mm1286) that drives reporter gene expression in a pattern that strongly recapitulates endogenous Grhl2 in the craniofacial primordia, modulates Grhl2 expression in these tissues, and augments Grhl2-mediated closure of the secondary palate. Deletion of this genomic element, in the context of inactivation of one allele of Grhl2 (through generation of double heterozygous Grhl2<sup>+/</sup><sup>-</sup>;mm1286<sup>+/</sup><sup>-</sup> mice), results in a significant predisposition to palatal clefting at birth. Moreover, we found that a highly conserved 325 bp region of mm1286 is both necessary and sufficient for mediating the craniofacial-specific enhancer activity of this region, and that an extremely well-conserved 12-bp sequence within this element (CTGTCAAACAGGT) substantially determines full enhancer function. Together, these data provide valuable new insights into the upstream genomic regulatory landscape responsible for transcriptional control of Grhl2 during palatal closure."	"Recently, there has been increased studies in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We aimed to make an overview of research trends and genetic polymorphisms for NIHL from 2009 to 2018 with VOSviewer software. A total of 2391 papers were identified for research trends analysis in NIHL and 33 studies identified for a brief review of genetic polymorphisms in human NIHL. The number of publications has been increasing over the past decade. The journal Hearing Research published the most articles (218). The USA contributed the largest number of papers (1042; 43.58%), with the most citations (18,987) and the highest H-index (60). The University of Washington was the most contributive institution. Liberman MC published the most articles (32), and Kujawa SG possessed the highest co-citations (584). Except for high-frequency keywords identified by the software, &quot;prevalence,&quot; &quot;oxidative stress,&quot; &quot;hair cells,&quot; and &quot;cochlear implant&quot; were also the latest research frontiers. HSPA1A rs1043618, HSPA1L rs2227956, PON2 rs12026 and rs7785846, SOD2 rs2855116, KCNE1 rs2070358, KCNQ4 rs34287852, GJB2 rs3751385, PCDH15 rs7095441 and rs11004085, GRHL2 rs1981361, ITGA8 rs10508489, MYH14 rs667907, and POU4F3 rs891969 were the research hotspots and were replicated in independent samples. Inflammation response underlying NIHL has emerged and should be considered as a pioneering field in the future for the prevention of NIHL and conservation of hearing."	"<b>:</b> The <i>Drosophila</i><i>grainyhead</i> (<i>grh</i>) and vertebrate <i>Grainyhead</i>-<i>like</i> (<i>Grhl</i>) transcription factors are among the most critical genes for epithelial development, maintenance and homeostasis, and are remarkably well conserved from fungi to humans. Mutations affecting <i>grh/Grhl</i> function lead to a myriad of developmental and adult onset epithelial disease, such as aberrant skin barrier formation, facial/palatal clefting, impaired neural tube closure, age-related hearing loss, ectodermal dysplasia, and importantly, cancers of epithelial origin. Recently, mutations in the family member <i>GRHL3</i> have been shown to lead to both syndromic and non-syndromic facial and palatal clefting in humans, particularly the genetic disorder Van Der Woude Syndrome (VWS), as well as spina bifida, whereas mutations in mammalian <i>Grhl2</i> lead to exencephaly and facial clefting. As transcription factors, Grhl proteins bind to and activate (or repress) a substantial number of target genes that regulate and drive a cascade of transcriptional networks. A multitude of large-scale datasets have been generated to explore the <i>grh</i>/<i>Grhl</i>-dependent transcriptome, following ablation or mis-regulation of <i>grh</i>/<i>Grhl</i>-function. Here, we have performed a meta-analysis of all 41 currently published <i>grh</i> and <i>Grhl</i> RNA-SEQ, and microarray datasets, in order to identify and characterise the transcriptional networks controlled by <i>grh</i>/<i>Grhl</i> genes across disparate biological contexts. Moreover, we have also cross-referenced our results with published ChIP and ChIP-SEQ datasets, in order to determine which of the critical effector genes are likely to be direct <i>grh/Grhl</i> targets, based on genomic occupancy by <i>grh</i>/<i>Grhl</i> genes. Lastly, to interrogate the predictive strength of our approach, we experimentally validated the expression of the top 10 candidate <i>grhl</i> target genes in epithelial development, in a zebrafish model lacking <i>grhl3</i>, and found that orthologues of seven of these (<i>cldn23,</i><i>ppl, prom2, ocln, slc6a19</i>, <i>aldh1a3</i>, and <i>sod3</i>) were significantly down-regulated at 48 hours post-fertilisation. Therefore, our study provides a strong predictive resource for the identification of putative <i>grh</i>/<i>grhl</i> effector target genes."	"Notwithstanding the positive clinical impact of endocrine therapies in estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer, de novo and acquired resistance limits the therapeutic lifespan of existing drugs. Taking the position that resistance is nearly inevitable, we undertook a study to identify and exploit targetable vulnerabilities that were manifest in endocrine therapy-resistant disease. Using cellular and mouse models of endocrine therapy-sensitive and endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer, together with contemporary discovery platforms, we identified a targetable pathway that is composed of the transcription factors FOXA1 and GRHL2, a coregulated target gene, the membrane receptor LYPD3, and the LYPD3 ligand, AGR2. Inhibition of the activity of this pathway using blocking antibodies directed against LYPD3 or AGR2 inhibits the growth of endocrine therapy-resistant tumors in mice, providing the rationale for near-term clinical development of humanized antibodies directed against these proteins."	"Cancer cells exhibit phenotypic plasticity during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) involving intermediate states. To study genome-wide epigenetic remodeling associated with EMT plasticity, we integrate the analyses of DNA methylation, ChIP-sequencing of five histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27Ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) and transcriptome profiling performed on ovarian cancer cells with different epithelial/mesenchymal states and on a knockdown model of EMT suppressor Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2). We have identified differentially methylated CpG sites associated with EMT, found at promoters of epithelial genes and GRHL2 binding sites. GRHL2 knockdown results in CpG methylation gain and nucleosomal remodeling (reduction in permissive marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac; elevated repressive mark H3K27me3), resembling the changes observed across progressive EMT states. Epigenetic-modifying agents such as 5-azacitidine, GSK126 and mocetinostat further reveal cell state-dependent plasticity upon GRHL2 overexpression. Overall, we demonstrate that epithelial genes are subject to epigenetic control during intermediate phases of EMT/MET involving GRHL2."	"Dysfunctions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-regulated cell migration and invasion have been involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE). However, the role of circRNAs in EMT of PE has not been widely investigated. In this study, we identified that circTNRC18 was upregulated in PE placentas compared with normal pregnancy placentas. Moreover, circTNRC18 negatively regulated trophoblast cell migration and EMT. Overexpression of circTNRC18 reduced while depletion of circTNRC18 enhanced trophoblast cell migration and EMT. Mechanistically, circTNRC18 sponged miR-762 contributed to inhibit miR-762 activity and elevated EMT-related transcriptional factor Grhl2 protein level. miR-762 expression was lower in PE placentas and played a promoting role in trophoblast cell migration and EMT. In contrast, Grhl2 was highly expressed in PE placentas. Furthermore, we confirmed that upregulation of Grhl2 by circ-TNRC18-induced inhibition of miR-762 led to trophoblast cell migration and EMT. In conclusions, circTNRC18/miR-762/Grhl2 axis plays a key role in trophoblast cell migration and EMT. circTNRC18/miR-762/Grhl2 axis may be a potential therapeutic target in PE."	"Oral mucosa provides the first line of defense against a diverse array of environmental and microbial irritants by forming the barrier of epithelial cells interconnected by multiprotein tight junctions (TJ), adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junction complexes. Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), an epithelial-specific transcription factor, may play a role in the formation of the mucosal epithelial barrier, as it regulates the expression of the junction proteins. The current study investigated the role of GRHL2 in the <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>Pg</i>)-induced impairment of epithelial barrier functions. Exposure of human oral keratinocytes (HOK-16B and OKF6 cells) to <i>Pg</i> or <i>Pg-</i>derived lipopolysaccharides (<i>Pg</i> LPSs) led to rapid loss of endogenous GRHL2 and the junction proteins (e.g., zonula occludens, E-cadherin, claudins, and occludin). GRHL2 directly regulated the expression levels of the junction proteins and the epithelial permeability for small molecules (e.g., dextrans and <i>Pg</i> bacteria). To explore the functional role of GRHL2 in oral mucosal barrier, we used a <i>Grhl2</i> conditional knockout (KO) mouse model, which allows for epithelial tissue-specific <i>Grhl2</i> KO in an inducible manner. <i>Grhl2</i> KO impaired the expression of the junction proteins at the junctional epithelium and increased the alveolar bone loss in the ligature-induced periodontitis model. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed increased epithelial penetration of oral bacteria in <i>Grhl2</i> KO mice compared with the wild-type mice. Also, blood loadings of oral bacteria (e.g., <i>Bacteroides, Bacillus, Firmicutes</i>, β-<i>proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Spirochetes</i>) were significantly elevated in <i>Grhl2</i> KO mice compared to the wild-type littermates. These data indicate that <i>Pg</i> bacteria may enhance paracellular penetration through oral mucosa in part by targeting the expression of GRHL2 in the oral epithelial cells, which then impairs the epithelial barrier by inhibition of junction protein expression, resulting in increased alveolar tissue destruction and systemic bacteremia."	"Cutaneous ulcers are a common cause of morbidity. We have developed a de novo epithelialization method for treating cutaneous ulcers by means of reprogramming wound-resident mesenchymal cells in vivo into cells able to form a stratified epithelium: induced stratified epithelial progenitors (iSEPs). Administration of 4 transcription factors (DNP63A, GRHL2, TFAP2A, and cMYC) expressed via adeno-associated viral vectors enabled generation of epithelial cells and tissues, thereby acheiving de novo epithelialization from the surfaces of cutaneous ulcers in a mouse model. Generated epithelia, having barrier functions equivalent to the original epidermis, were maintained for more than 6 months. Our findings constitute a proof of concept for future development towards innovative therapies for cutaneous ulcers via de novo epithelialization."	"Mutations associated with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) have been identified in three genes: ZEB1 (zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1) associated with sub-type PPCD3; OVOL2 (ovol-like zinc finger 2) associated with sub-type PPCD1; and GRHL2 (grainyhead like transcription factor 2) associated with sub-type PPCD4. Each of these genes encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell-state transitions. While the discovery of these PPCD-associated genes has greatly expanded our knowledge of the genetic basis of PPCD, the molecular mechanisms via which mutations in these genes lead to indistinguishable disease phenotypes have yet to be elucidated. To characterize the gene expression profiles of the genetic sub-types of PPCD, RNA-seq was performed on corneal endothelium derived from an individual with PPCD1 who harbors a c.-307T &gt; C OVOL2 promoter mutation. Transcriptomic analysis of this and previously-reported RNA-seq data from two individuals with PPCD (the first with PPCD3 associated with a ZEB1 truncating mutation (c.1381delinsGACGAT) and the second with genetically unresolved PPCD in which ZEB1 coding region, OVOL2 promoter and GRHL2 promoter, exon 1, and intron 1 mutations were excluded) revealed: OVOL2 expression increased in PPCD1 (259 fold), unchanged in PPCD3 and slightly increased in genetically unresolved PPCD (from 0 TPM to 0.86 TPM, undefined fold change); ZEB1 expression decreased in PPCD1 (-5.9 fold), PPCD3 (-3.95 fold) and genetically unresolved PPCD (-3.96 fold); and GRHL2 expression increased in PPCD1 (333.5 fold), slightly increased (from 0 TPM to 0.67 TPM, undefined fold change) in PPCD3 and increased in genetically unresolved PPCD (1853 fold). Additionally, as the majority of pedigrees affected with PPCD remain genetically unresolved, we screened the promoter, exon 1, and intron 1 regions of GRHL2 in 24 PPCD probands who do not harbor a ZEB1 or OVOL2 mutation. GRHL2 screening did not identify any novel or rare GRHL2 variant in these 24 individuals. As ZEB1 can act as an activator or repressor of downstream target gene expression depending on Wnt signaling pathway activation or deactivation, we also sought to determine whether or not Wnt signaling is active in PPCD by performing immunohistochemistry in corneal tissue sections derived from an individual affected with PPCD3 and from an individual with genetically unresolved PPCD. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated corneal endothelial nuclear accumulation of S552 phos-β-catenin and cytosolic localization of S33/37/T42 non-phosphorylated β-catenin in PPCD, indicating aberrant activation of Wnt signaling, which was not observed in control corneal endothelium. These findings suggest that alterations in the ZEB1-OVOL2-GRHL2 axis (caused by PPCD-associated mutations) lead to changes in corneal endothelial cell state and molecular pathways, including the aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway."	"The grainyhead-like-2 (GRHL2) genetic variants were reported in age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) susceptibility in several case-control studies. However, their conclusions are conflicting; it is difficult to precisely assess the disease risk associated with the variants. Therefore we conduct the meta-analysis to discover the association of GRHL2 polymorphisms and the risk of ARHI.A related literature search was conducted in on-line databases, such as Wanfang database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed (updated to August 30, 2018). We use Review Manager 5.0 and Stata SE 12.0 software to reckon the odds radio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and P value in random- or fixed-effects model according to the I2 value in the heterogeneity test.2762 cases and 2321 controls in 5 articles were provided data to the meta-analysis. The pooled ORs (95% CI) of the rs10955255 polymorphism were 1.26 (1.05-1.50, P = .01), 1.33 (1.07-1.65, P = .01), and 1.32 (1.12-1.55, P = .0007) in the allele, homozygote and recessive model separately. Besides, a significant association was detected between rs1981361 in mixed population and the ARHI risk in the allele, heterozygote, and dominant genetic model respectively. Then subgroup analyses was performed by ethnicity, for rs10955255 meaningful associations were detected for the allele model, homozygote model, dominant model and recessive model in the Caucasian population but no relations in any of the 5 genetic models in Asian population.The meta-analysis indicated that the rs10955255 polymorphism could be an important risk factor for ARHI, especially in the Caucasians. The rs1981361 polymorphism may be a risk factor for ARHI in Asians. Larger scale researches are needed to further bring the consequences up to date."

"KCNQ4"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study was to explore the association between gene in the potassium recycling pathway 4 (KCNQ4) polymorphisms and the susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) , and analysis the effect of cumulative noise exposure (CNE) and noise exposure duration on this association. <b>Methods:</b> A nested case-control study with 1∶1 matched was used based on the cohort of noise exposure in a steel factory. A total of 286 cases were selected as the group of hearing loss and 286 controls were chosen according to the matching standards of same gender, same type of work, age difference ≤ 5 years, noise exposure duration ≤ 2 years. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of rs4660468, rs4660470, rs34287852 in KCNQ4 were genotyped by SNPscan(TM) method. The codominant, dominant and recessive models were established to study KCNQ4 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to NIHL by single-factor conditional logistic regression analysis. The COX regression analysis was used to analyze the risk of developing NIHL in individuals with different genotypes along with the extending of noise exposure duration or CNE. <b>Results:</b> In the case of CNE≤96 dB (A) ·year, the risk of developing NIHL in individuals with TA genotype of rs4660470 was 2.197 times than individuals with TT genotypes (95%<i>CI</i>: 1.032~4.677) , and those with TA+AA and TT genotypes (HR=2.467, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.025~5.934) With the increase of noise exposure duration, in rs4660470, individuals with TA genotype had a higher risk of suffering NIHL than those with TT genotype (HR=1.461, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.061~2.011) , individuals with TA and/or AA genotype had a earlier risk of suffering NIHL than those with TT genotype. <b>Conclusion:</b> The mutant allele A of rs4660470 in KCNQ4 may be a risk factor for developing NIHL, CNE≤100 dB (A) ·year or the increase of noise exposure duration may further increase the risk of NIHL."	"<b>目的：</b> 探讨钾离子通道4（potassium channel 4，KCNQ4）基因多态性在不同累积噪声暴露量（cumulative noise exposure，CNE）或不同接噪工龄状况下与噪声性听力损失（noise-induced hearing loss，NIHL）易感性间的关系。 <b>方法：</b> 于2019年7月采用1∶1巢式病例-对照研究，在河南省某钢铁厂噪声暴露队列研究人群中选择有双耳高频（3 000、4 000、6 000 Hz）平均听阈≥40 dB者为听力损失组，纯音听力测试任一耳语频（500、1 000、2 000 Hz）的任一频段听阈均≤25 dB，且纯音听力测试高频平均听阈&lt;35dB者作为对照组，听力损失组和对照组各286例。对调查对象进行一般体格检查和基本信息调查，进行纯音听力测试和作业场所噪声测量，采用中高通量单核苷酸多态性（single nucleotide polymorphisms，SNP）分型检测技术（SNPscan(TM)法）检测KCNQ4基因3个SNP（rs4660468，rs4660470和rs34287852位点）。检验对照组人群的哈温平衡（Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium）。应用COX回归方法分析基因单个位点与NIHL易感性间的关系以及随着CNE和接噪工龄的改变，不同基因型个体发生NIHL的风险大小。 <b>结果：</b> 本次研究对象男性274人，女性12人,年龄、性别、饮酒、接噪工龄、CNE、高血压患病情况的分布差异无统计学意义（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05），而吸烟、双耳高频平均听阈均值分布差异有统计学意义（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。校正了协变量年龄、接噪工龄、噪声暴露水平、吸烟、饮酒和高血压后，发现CNE≤96 dB（A）·年分层下，在共显性模型TA/TT下，rs4660470位点携带TA基因型的个体发生NIHL的风险是携带TT基因型个体的2.197倍（95%<i>CI</i>：1.032~4.677，<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）；96&lt;CNE≤100 dB（A）·年分层下，在显性模型TA+AA/TT下，携带TA+AA基因型的个体发生NIHL的风险是携带TT基因型个体2.467倍（95%<i>CI</i>：1.025~5.934，<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。随着接噪工龄的延长，rs4660470位点携带TA基因型的个体患NIHL的风险是携带TT基因型个体的1.461倍（95%<i>CI</i>：1.061~2.011，<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）；携带TA和AA基因型的个体患NIHL的风险高于携带TT基因型的个体（HR=1.415，95%<i>CI</i>：1.039~1.927，<i>P</i>&lt;0.05），且携带TA和/或AA基因型的个体出现NIHL的时间早于携带TT基因型的个体。 <b>结论：</b> KCNQ4基因的rs4660470位点突变型等位基因A可能是NIHL发生的一个危险因素，CNE≤100 dB（A）·年或接噪工龄延长可能会进一步增加NIHL易感性的风险。.Deafness non-syndromic autosomal dominant 2 (DFNA2) is characterized by symmetric, predominantly high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss that is progressive across all frequencies. The disease is associated with variants of a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 4 gene, KCNQ4 (Kv7.4). Here, we studied nine recently identified Kv7.4 variants in DFNA2 pedigrees, including V230E, E260K, D262V, Y270H, W275R, G287R, P291L, P291S and S680F. We proved that the variant S680F did not alter the channel function while the other eight variants resulted in function deficiencies. We further proved that the two variants E260K and P291S showed reduced cell membrane expressions while the other seven variants showed moderate cell surface expressions. Thus, trafficking deficiency is not a common mechanism underlying channel dysfunction. Next, we studied two variants, V230E and G287R, using molecular dynamics simulation. We showed that V230E stabilized Kv7.4 channel in the closed state by forming an additional hydrogen bond with a basic residue K325, while G287R distorted the selectivity filter and blocked the pore region of Kv7.4 channel. Moreover, by co-expressing wild-type (WT) and variant proteins in vitro, we demonstrated that the heterogeneous Kv7.4 channel currents were reduced compared to the WT channel currents and the reduction could be rescued by a Kv7.4 opener retigabine. Our study provided the underlying mechanisms and suggested a potential alternative therapeutic approach for DFNA2."	"The group of KCNQ-encoded voltage-gated potassium (Kv7) channels includes five family members (Kv7.1-7.5). We examined the molecular expression and functional roles of Kv7 channels in corporal smooth muscle (CSM). Isolated rabbit CSM strips were mounted in an organ bath system to characterize Kv7 channels during CSM relaxation. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were measured in the CSM using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye Fluo-4 AM. The expression of the KCNQ1-5 (the encoding genes for Kv7.1-7.5) and KCNE1-5 subtypes was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Electrophysiological recordings and an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) were also performed. ML213 (a Kv7.2/7.4/7.5 activator) exhibited the most potent relaxation effect. XE911 (a Kv7.1-7.5 blocker) significantly inhibited the relaxation caused by ML213. Removal of the endothelium from the CSM did not affect the relaxation effect of ML213. H-89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor) and ESI-09 (an exchange protein directly activated by cAMP inhibitor) significantly inhibited ML213-induced relaxation (H-89: 31.3%; ESI-09: 52.7%). XE991 significantly increased basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in hCSM cells. KCNQ4 (the Kv7.4-encoding gene) and KCNE4 in CSM were the most abundantly expressed subtypes in humans and rats, respectively. KCNQ4 and KCNE4 expression was significantly decreased in diabetes mellitus rats. ML213 significantly increased the outward current amplitude. XE991 inhibited the ML213-induced outward currents. ML213 hyperpolarized the hCSM cell membrane potential. Subsequent addition of XE991 completely reversed the ML213-induced hyperpolarizing effects. A combination of Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 antibodies generated a strong PLA signal. We found that the Kv7.4 channel is a potential target for ED treatment."	"Recently, there has been increased studies in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We aimed to make an overview of research trends and genetic polymorphisms for NIHL from 2009 to 2018 with VOSviewer software. A total of 2391 papers were identified for research trends analysis in NIHL and 33 studies identified for a brief review of genetic polymorphisms in human NIHL. The number of publications has been increasing over the past decade. The journal Hearing Research published the most articles (218). The USA contributed the largest number of papers (1042; 43.58%), with the most citations (18,987) and the highest H-index (60). The University of Washington was the most contributive institution. Liberman MC published the most articles (32), and Kujawa SG possessed the highest co-citations (584). Except for high-frequency keywords identified by the software, &quot;prevalence,&quot; &quot;oxidative stress,&quot; &quot;hair cells,&quot; and &quot;cochlear implant&quot; were also the latest research frontiers. HSPA1A rs1043618, HSPA1L rs2227956, PON2 rs12026 and rs7785846, SOD2 rs2855116, KCNE1 rs2070358, KCNQ4 rs34287852, GJB2 rs3751385, PCDH15 rs7095441 and rs11004085, GRHL2 rs1981361, ITGA8 rs10508489, MYH14 rs667907, and POU4F3 rs891969 were the research hotspots and were replicated in independent samples. Inflammation response underlying NIHL has emerged and should be considered as a pioneering field in the future for the prevention of NIHL and conservation of hearing."	"Outer hair cells (OHCs) enhance the sensitivity and the frequency tuning of the mammalian cochlea. Similar to the primary sensory receptor, the inner hair cells (IHCs), the mature functional characteristics of OHCs are acquired before hearing onset. We found that OHCs, like IHCs, fire spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> -induced action potentials (APs) during immature stages of development, which are driven by Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We also showed that the development of low- and high-frequency hair cells is differentially regulated during pre-hearing stages, with the former cells being more strongly dependent on experience-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potential activity.Sound amplification within the mammalian cochlea depends upon specialized hair cells, the outer hair cells (OHCs), which possess both sensory and motile capabilities. In various altricial rodents, OHCs become functionally competent from around postnatal day 7 (P7), before the primary sensory inner hair cells (IHCs), which become competent at about the onset of hearing (P12). The mechanisms responsible for the maturation of OHCs and their synaptic specialization remain poorly understood. We report that spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the immature cochlea, which is generated by Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, differentially regulates the maturation of hair cells along the cochlea. Under near-physiological recording conditions we found that, similar to IHCs, immature OHCs elicited spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials (APs), but only during the first few postnatal days. Genetic ablation of these APs in vivo, using Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, prevented the normal developmental acquisition of mature-like basolateral membrane currents in low-frequency (apical) hair cells, such as I<sub>K,n</sub> (carried by KCNQ4 channels), I<sub>SK2</sub> and I<sub>ACh</sub> (α9α10nAChRs) in OHCs and I<sub>K,n</sub> and I<sub>K,f</sub> (BK channels) in IHCs. Electromotility and prestin expression in OHCs were normal in Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The maturation of high-frequency (basal) hair cells was also affected in Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but to a much lesser extent than apical cells. However, a characteristic feature in Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.3<sup>-/-</sup> mice was the reduced hair cell size irrespective of their cochlear location. We conclude that the development of low- and high-frequency hair cells is differentially regulated during development, with apical cells being more strongly dependent on experience-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> APs."	"KCNQ4 is frequently mutated in autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL), a typically late-onset, initially high-frequency loss that progresses over time (DFNA2). Most KCNQ4 mutations linked to hearing loss are clustered around the pore region of the protein and lead to loss of KCNQ4-mediated potassium currents. To understand the contribution of KCNQ4 variants to NSHL, we surveyed public databases and found 17 loss-of-function and six missense KCNQ4 variants affecting amino acids around the pore region. The missense variants have not been reported as pathogenic and are present at a low frequency (minor allele frequency &lt; 0.0005) in the population. We examined the functional impact of these variants, which, interestingly, induced a reduction in potassium channel activity without altering expression or trafficking of the channel protein, being functionally similar to DFNA2-associated KCNQ4 mutations. Therefore, these variants may be risk factors for late-onset hearing loss, and individuals harboring any one of these variants may develop hearing loss during adulthood. Reduced channel activity could be rescued by KCNQ activators, suggesting the possibility of medical intervention. These findings indicate that KCNQ4 variants may contribute more to late-onset NSHL than expected, and therefore, genetic screening for this gene is important for the prevention and treatment of NSHL."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory deficit in humans, and genetic factors contribute to about half of the cases. With 112 causative genes identified so far and a disproportionate share of the genes within different ethnic groups, HL has proven to be quite heterogeneous.Twenty Iranian families having at least 2 children with hereditary HL were initially verified to be GJB2-negative and were then subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing was used to confirm segregation of the variant identified in each family.In 3 families, WES revealed 3 novel variants in KCNQ4, LHFPL5 and COCH genes. The KCNQ4 gene (DFNA2A) encodes a potassium channel (KV7.4) and the heterozygous variant identified (c.1647C&gt;G, p.F549L) resulted in the substitution of Phe549 residing in the KV7.4 cytoplasmic region. The homozygous variant (c.34A&gt;T, p.K12X) was identified in the LHFPL5 gene (DFNB67) which encodes a transmembrane protein, and another variant in a homozygous state (c.116T&gt;A, p.L39X) was identified in the COCH gene which encodes a secretory protein. Pathogenic variants in the COCH gene are associated with late onset autosomal dominant hearing loss (DFNA9) but the affected individuals displayed early onset HL with a recessive mode of inheritance.The 16% contribution of GJB2 to HL in the Iranian population necessitates the discovery of the remaining causal factors. This study is the first to report KCNQ4 and COCH related HL in the Iranian population and the second study, globally, to report HL due to biallelic inactivation of the COCH gene."	"DFNA2 is a progressive deafness caused by mutations in the voltage-activated potassium channel KCNQ4. Hearing loss develops with age from a mild increase in the hearing threshold to profound deafness. Studies using transgenic mice for Kcnq4 expressed in a mixed background demonstrated the implication of outer hair cells at the initial phase. However, it could not explain the last phase mechanisms of the disease. Genetic backgrounds are known to influence disease expressivity. To unmask the cause of profound deafness phenotype, we backcrossed the Kcnq4 knock-out allele to the inbred strain C3H/HeJ and investigated inner and outer hair cell and spiral ganglion neuron degeneration across the lifespan. In addition to the already reported outer hair cell death, the C3H/HeJ strain also exhibited inner hair cell and spiral ganglion neuron death. We tracked the spatiotemporal survival of cochlear cells by plotting cytocochleograms and neuronal counts at different ages. Cell loss progressed from basal to apical turns with age. Interestingly, the time-course of cell degeneration was different for each cell-type. While for outer hair cells it was already present by week 3, inner hair cell and neuronal loss started 30 weeks later. We also established that outer hair cell loss kinetics slowed down from basal to apical regions correlating with KCNQ4 expression pattern determined in wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that KCNQ4 plays differential roles in each cochlear cell-type impacting in their survival ability. Inner hair cell and spiral ganglion neuron death generates severe hearing loss that could be associated with the last phase of DFNA2."	"Variants of KCNQ4 are one of the most common causes of dominantly inherited nonsyndromic hearing loss. We investigated a consanguineous family in which two individuals had prelignual hearing loss, apparently inherited in a recessive mode. Whole-exome sequencing analyses demonstrated genetic heterogeneity as variants in two different genes segregated with the phenotype in two branches of the family. Members in one branch were homozygous for a pathogenic variant of TMC1. The other two affected individuals were homozygous for a missense pathogenic variant in KCNQ4 c.872C&gt;T; p.(Pro291Leu). These two individuals had prelingual, progressive moderate to severe hearing loss, while a heterozygous carrier had late onset mild hearing loss. Our work demonstrates that p.Pro291L variant is semi-dominantly inherited. This is the first report of semi-dominance of a KCNQ4 variant."	"Calmodulin (CaM) conveys intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to KCNQ (Kv7, &quot;M-type&quot;) K<sup>+</sup> channels and many other ion channels. Whether this &quot;calmodulation&quot; involves a dramatic structural rearrangement or only slight perturbations of the CaM/KCNQ complex is as yet unclear. A consensus structural model of conformational shifts occurring between low nanomolar and physiologically high intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is still under debate. Here, we used various techniques of biophysical chemical analyses to investigate the interactions between CaM and synthetic peptides corresponding to the A and B domains of the KCNQ4 subtype. We found that in the absence of CaM, the peptides are disordered, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM imposed helical structure on both KCNQ A and B domains. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM has higher affinity for the B domain than for the A domain of KCNQ2-4 and much higher affinity for the B domain when prebound with the A domain. X-ray crystallography confirmed that these discrete peptides spontaneously form a complex with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, similar to previous reports of CaM binding KCNQ-AB domains that are linked together. Microscale thermophoresis and heteronuclear single-quantum coherence NMR spectroscopy indicated the C-lobe of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free CaM to interact with the KCNQ4 B domain (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> ∼10-20 μm), with increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> molar ratios shifting the CaM-B domain interactions via only the CaM C-lobe to also include the N-lobe. Our findings suggest that in response to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM undergoes lobe switching that imposes a dramatic mutually induced conformational fit to both the proximal C terminus of KCNQ4 channels and CaM, likely underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of KCNQ gating."	"Posttranslational modification of histones alters their interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins, influencing gene expression and cell fate. In this study, we investigated the effect of G9a (KMT1C, EHMT2), a major histone lysine methyltransferase encoded by the human EHMT2 gene and responsible for histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) on noise-induced permanent hearing loss (NIHL) in adult CBA/J mice. The conditions of noise exposure used in this study led to losses of cochlear synapses and outer hair cells (OHCs) and permanent auditory threshold shifts. Inhibition of G9a with its specific inhibitor BIX 01294 or with siRNA significantly attenuated these pathological features. Treatment with BIX 01294 also prevented the noise-induced decrease of KCNQ4 immunolabeling in OHCs. Additionally, G9a was increased in cochlear cells, including both outer and inner sensory hair cells, some spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), and marginal cells, 1 h after the completion of the noise exposure. Also subsequent to noise exposure, immunoreactivity for H3K9me2 appeared in some nuclei of OHCs following a high-to-low frequency gradient with more labeled OHCs in the 45-kHz than the 32-kHz region, as well as in the marginal cells and in some SGNs of the basal turn. These findings suggest that epigenetic modifications of H3K9me2 are involved in NIHL and that pharmacological targeting of G9a may offer a strategy for protection against cochlear synaptopathy and NIHL."	"Diabetes is a very strong predictor of chronic systemic vascular diseases and acute cardiovascular events. Recently, associations between metabolic disorders and pulmonary hypertension have also been reported in both humans and animal models. In order to get some further insight into the relationship of pulmonary hypertension with obesity, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, herein we have used the Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/clr-lepr fa) at 20 weeks fed a standard diet and compared to their lean Zucker littermates (ZL). ZDF rats were obese, had elevated plasma glucose levels and insulin resistance, i.e. a clinically relevant model of type 2 diabetes. They presented elevated systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary arterial pressures and a parallel increase in the Fulton index. Systemic arterial pressures were also increased but the left ventricle plus septum weight was similar in both groups and the heart rate was reduced. Wall media thickening was observed in the small pulmonary arteries from the ZDF rats. Isolated pulmonary arteries mounted in a wire myograph showed similar vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine and 5-HT and similar responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. However, the iNOS inhibitor 1400W enhanced the vasoconstrictor responses in ZDF but not in ZL rats. The protein expression of eNOS and iNOS was not significantly different in the lungs of the two groups. The lung expression of Bmpr2 mRNA was downregulated. However, the mRNA expression of Kcna5, Kcnk3, Kcnq1, Kcnq4 or Kcnq5, which encode for the potassium channels Kv1.5, TASK-1, Kv7.1, Kv7.4 and Kv7.5, respectively, was similar in ZL and ZDF rats. In conclusion, ZDF rats show increased pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary arterial medial thickening and downregulated lung Bmpr2 despite leptin resistance. These changes were mild but are consistent with the view that diabetes is a risk factor for pulmonary hypertension."	"Recent research suggests that KCNQ isoforms, particularly the KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 subtypes expressed in smooth muscle cells, are involved in both establishing and maintaining resting membrane potentials and regulating smooth muscle contractility. Retigabine (RTG) is a first-in-class antiepileptic drug that potentiates neuronal KCNQ potassium channels, but poor subtype selectivity limits its further application as a pharmacological tool. In this study, we improved the subtype specificity of retigabine by altering the N-1/3 substituents and discovered several compounds that show better selectivity for KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 channels. Among these compounds, <b>10g</b> is highly selective for KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 channels without potentiating KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 channels. These results are an advance in the exploration of small molecule modifiers that selectively activate different KCNQ isoforms. The developed compounds could also serve as new pharmacological tools for elucidating the function of KCNQ channels natively expressed in various tissues."	"Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 4 (KCNQ4) are etiologically linked to nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), deafness nonsyndromic autosomal dominant 2 (DFNA2). To identify causative mutations of hearing loss in 98 Korean families, we performed whole exome sequencing. In four independent families with NSHL, we identified a cosegregating heterozygous missense mutation, c.140T&gt;C (p.Leu47Pro), in KCNQ4. Individuals with the c.140T&gt;C KCNQ4 mutation shared a haplotype flanking the mutated nucleotide, suggesting that this mutation may have arisen from a common ancestor in Korea. The mutant KCNQ4 protein could reach the plasma membrane and interact with wild-type (WT) KCNQ4, excluding a trafficking defect; however, it exhibited significantly decreased voltage-gated potassium channel activity and fast deactivation kinetics compared with WT KCNQ4. In addition, when co-expressed with WT KCNQ4, mutant KCNQ4 protein exerted a dominant-negative effect. Interestingly, the channel activity of the p.Leu47Pro KCNQ4 protein was rescued by the KCNQ activators MaxiPost and zinc pyrithione. The c.140T&gt;C (p.Leu47Pro) mutation in KCNQ4 causes progressive NSHL; however, the defective channel activity of the mutant protein can be rescued using channel activators. Hence, in individuals with the c.140T&gt;C mutation, NSHL is potentially treatable, or its progression may be delayed by KCNQ activators."	"Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 4 (KCNQ4) are etiologically linked to a type of nonsyndromic hearing loss, deafness nonsyndromic autosomal dominant 2 (DFNA2). We performed whole-exome sequencing for 98 families with hearing loss and found mutations in KCNQ4 in five families. In this study, we characterized two novel mutations in KCNQ4: a missense mutation (c.796G&gt;T; p.Asp266Tyr) and an in-frame deletion mutation (c.259_267del; p.Val87_Asn89del). p.Asp266Tyr located in the channel pore region resulted in early onset and moderate hearing loss, whereas p.Val87_Asn89del located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region resulted in late onset and high frequency-specific hearing loss. When heterologously expressed in HEK 293 T cells, both mutant proteins did not show defects in protein trafficking to the plasma membrane or in interactions with wild-type (WT) KCNQ4 channels. Patch-clamp analysis demonstrated that both p.Asp266Tyr and p.Val87_Asn89del mutant channels lost conductance and were completely unresponsive to KCNQ activators, such as retigabine, zinc pyrithione, and ML213. Channels assembled from WT-p.Asp266Tyr concatemers, like those from WT-WT concatemers, exhibited conductance and responsiveness to KCNQ activators. However, channels assembled from WT-p.Val87_Asn89del concatemers showed impaired conductance, suggesting that p.Val87_Asn89del caused complete loss-of-function with a strong dominant-negative effect on functional WT channels. Therefore, the main pathological mechanism may be related to loss of K<sup>+</sup> channel activity, not defects in trafficking."	"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. The aim of this study was to clarify the genetic aetiology of nonsyndromic hearing loss in the Moravian-Silesian population of the Czech Republic.This study included 200 patients (93 males, 107 females, mean age 16.9 years, ranging from 4 months to 62 years) with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. We screened all patients for mutations in <i>GJB2</i> and the large deletion del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830). We performed further screening for additional genes (<i>SERPINB6</i>, <i>TMIE</i>, <i>COCH</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>KCNQ4</i>, and <i>GJB3</i>) with Sanger sequencing on a subset of patients that were negative for <i>GJB2</i> mutations.We detected biallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutations in 44 patients (22%). Among these patients, 63.6%, 9.1% and 2.3% exhibited homozygous c.35delG, p.Trp24*, and p.Met34Thr mutations, respectively. The remaining 25% of these patients exhibited compound heterozygous c.35delG, c.-23+1G&gt;A, p.Trp24*, p.Val37Ile, p.Met34Thr, p.Leu90Pro, c.235delC, c.313_326del14, p.Ser139Asn, and p.Gly147Leu mutations. We found a monoallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutation in 12 patients (6.6%). We found no pathogenic mutations in the other tested genes. <i>Conclusions:</i> One fifth of our cohort had deafness related to <i>GJB2</i> mutations. The del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830), <i>SERPINB6</i>, <i>TMIE</i>, <i>COCH</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>GJB3</i>, and <i>KCNQ4</i> mutations were infrequently associated with deafness in the Moravian-Silesian population. Therefore, we suggest that del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830) testing should be performed only when patients with deafness carry the monoallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutation."	"Neuronal voltage-gated potassium channels, K<sub>V</sub>7s, are the molecular mediators of the M current and regulate membrane excitability in the central and peripheral neuronal systems. Herein, we report novel small molecule K<sub>V</sub>7 openers that demonstrate anti-seizure activities in electroshock and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure models without influencing Rotarod readouts in mice. The anti-seizure activity was determined to be proportional to the unbound concentration in the brain. K<sub>V</sub>7 channels are also expressed in the bladder smooth muscle (detrusor) and activation of these channels may cause localized undesired effects. Therefore, the impact of individual K<sub>V</sub>7 isoforms was investigated in human detrusor tissue using a panel of K<sub>V</sub>7 openers with distinct activity profiles among K<sub>V</sub>7 isoforms. KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 mRNA were highly expressed in detrusor tissue, yet a compound that has significantly reduced activity on homomeric K<sub>V</sub>7.4 did not reduce detrusor contraction. This may suggest that the homomeric K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel plays a less significant role in bladder contraction and further investigation is needed."	"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are synthesized from dietary carbohydrates by colonic bacterial fermentation. These SCFAs supply energy, suppress cancer, and affect ion transport. However, their roles in ion transport and regulation in the intracellular environment remain unknown. In order to elucidate the roles of SCFAs, we measured short-circuit currents (I<sub>SC</sub>) and performed RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses of ion transporters in rat rectal colon. The application of 30 mM butyrate shifted I<sub>SC</sub> in a negative direction, but did not attenuate the activity of epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels (ENaC). The application of bumetanide, a Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter inhibitor, to the basolateral side reduced the negative I<sub>SC</sub> shift induced by butyrate. The application of XE991, a KCNQ-type K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibitor, to the apical side decreased the I<sub>SC</sub> shift induced by butyrate in a dose-dependent manner. The I<sub>SC</sub> shift was independent of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and insensitive to ibuprofen, an SMCT1 inhibitor. The mucosa from rat rectal colon expressed mRNAs of H<sup>+</sup>-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1, MCT4, and MCT5, also referred to as SLC16A1, SLC16A3, and SLC16A4, respectively). RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that KCNQ2 and KCNQ4 localized to the apical membrane of surface cells in rat rectal colon. These results indicate that butyrate, which may be transported by H<sup>+</sup>-coupled monocarboxylate transporters, activates K<sup>+</sup> secretion through KCNQ-type K<sup>+</sup> channels on the apical membrane in rat rectal colon. KCNQ-type K<sup>+</sup> channels may play a role in intestinal secretion and defense mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract."	"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a complex myocardial disease of multifactorial etiologies, including enlarged cardiac chambers and contractile dysfunction. It has been suggested that the inheritance of DCM‑associated mutations predominates its onset. Therefore, the present study investigated the pathogenesis of DCM via pedigree analysis and genetic diagnosis by massive whole‑exome screening, and targeted exon capture. To study the familial gene‑phenotype association, the exon and splice sites of 325 hereditary disease‑associated genes in the proband with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDC), including 61 cardiac disease‑associated genes, such as the lamins A/C (LMNA), were analyzed by ultra‑high multiplex polymerase chain reaction and the Ion AmpliSeq™ Inherited Disease Panel. The present study also conducted Sanger DNA Sequencing for family members with global minor allele frequencies &lt;1% to verify potential pathogenic mutation sites. A total of three rare missense mutations were detected, including heterozygous c.244G&gt;A in LMNA, c.546C&gt;G in potassium voltage‑gated channel subfamily KQT (KCNQ4) and c.1276G&gt;A in EYA transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase 1 (EYA1), indicating a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 82 (p.E82K) in LMNA, a p.F182L in KCNQ4 (a mutation associated with pathogenic deafness) and p.G426S in EYA1 (associated with Branchiootorenal syndrome 1 and Branchiootic syndrome 1 pathogenesis). In the present study, a carrier with slight hearing impairment was detected in the family analyzed; however, no patients with deafness or branchiootorenal syndrome were observed. LMNA p.E82K revealed SIFT and PolyPhen‑2 scores of 0 and 1, respectively. In the second generation, 3 patients with DCM underwent permanent pacemaker implantation due to sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block and unstable cardiac electrophysiology. The present study suggested that LMNA p.E82K may contribute to the pathogenesis of FDC and concomitant atrioventricular block. At present, only three families with DCM resulting from similar mutations have been reported. The present study demonstrated the strong pathogenic effects of LMNA p.E82K on DCM."
"MYH14"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"This study aimed to investigate the association between candidate genetic variants and audiometric measures of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in young musicians.The study analyzed a database by Phillips et al. (Feasibility of a bilateral 4000-6000 Hz notch as a phenotype for genetic association analysis. Int J Audiol 2015;54:645-52.) which included behavioral hearing thresholds, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), tympanometric, and genetic data of 166 participants meeting the inclusion criteria. Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13 cochlear genes previously associated with NIHL in factory workers were included in the present investigation. The average hearing threshold at 3000 and 4000 Hz (AHT) and average DPOAE signal to noise ratio (DPOAE SNR) in both ears were calculated.The regression analyses showed that two SNPs- one in KCNE1 (rs2070358) and the other in CAT (rs12273124) revealed a statistically significant relationship with DPOAE SNR in both ears. Two SNPs in MYH14 and one in GJB4 revealed a significant association with DPOAE SNR in the left ear. Two SNPs in HSP70, one in CDH23 and one in KCNJ10 showed significant association with DPOAE SNR in the right ear. None of the included SNPs showed association with AHT in both ears.A genetic variant in KCNE1 was associated with the strength of the cochlear amplifier as assessed by DPOAE SNR. Musicians carrying causal genetic variants to NIHL might exhibit changes in their auditory functions early in the lifespan even when most subjects had their hearing thresholds within normal limits. These participants are likely to show the clinical manifestation of NIHL in the future if no preventive measures are applied."	"Neurological diseases (NDs) are progressive disorders, the progression of which can be significantly affected by a range of common diseases that present as comorbidities. Clinical studies, including epidemiological and neuropathological analyses, indicate that patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have worse progression of NDs, suggesting pathogenic links between NDs and T2D. However, finding causal or predisposing factors that link T2D and NDs remains challenging. To address these problems, we developed a high-throughput network-based quantitative pipeline using agnostic approaches to identify genes expressed abnormally in both T2D and NDs, to identify some of the shared molecular pathways that may underpin T2D and ND interaction. We employed gene expression transcriptomic datasets from control and disease-affected individuals and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tissues of patients with T2D and ND when compared to unaffected control individuals. One hundred and ninety seven DEGs (99 up-regulated and 98 down-regulated in affected individuals) that were common to both the T2D and the ND datasets were identified. Functional annotation of these identified DEGs revealed the involvement of significant cell signaling associated molecular pathways. The overlapping DEGs (i.e., seen in both T2D and ND datasets) were then used to extract the most significant GO terms. We performed validation of these results with gold benchmark databases and literature searching, which identified which genes and pathways had been previously linked to NDs or T2D and which are novel. Hub proteins in the pathways were identified (including DNM2, DNM1, MYH14, PACSIN2, TFRC, PDE4D, ENTPD1, PLK4, CDC20B, and CDC14A) using protein-protein interaction analysis which have not previously been described as playing a role in these diseases. To reveal the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of the DEGs we used transcription factor (TF) interactions analysis and DEG-microRNAs (miRNAs) interaction analysis, respectively. We thus identified the following TFs as important in driving expression of our T2D/ND common genes: FOXC1, GATA2, FOXL1, YY1, E2F1, NFIC, NFYA, USF2, HINFP, MEF2A, SRF, NFKB1, USF2, HINFP, MEF2A, SRF, NFKB1, PDE4D, CREB1, SP1, HOXA5, SREBF1, TFAP2A, STAT3, POU2F2, TP53, PPARG, and JUN. MicroRNAs that affect expression of these genes include mir-335-5p, mir-16-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-17-5p, mir-124-3p. Thus, our transcriptomic data analysis identifies novel potential links between NDs and T2D pathologies that may underlie comorbidity interactions, links that may include potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In sum, our neighborhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology methods identified novel putative biomarkers that indicate how type 2 diabetes (T2D) and these neurological diseases interact and pathways that, in the future, may be targeted for treatment."	"Hearing loss (HL) represents the most common congenital sensory impairment with an incidence of 1-5 per 1000 live births. Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is an isolated finding that is not part of any other disorder accounting for 70% of all genetic hearing loss cases.In the current study, we reported a polygenic mode of inheritance in an NSHL consanguineous family using exome sequencing technology and we evaluated the possible effect of the detected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using in silico methods.Two bi-allelic SNVs were detected in the affected patients; a MYO15A (. p.V485A) variant, and a novel MITF (p.P338L) variant. Along with these homozygous mutations, we detected two heterozygous variants in well described hearing loss genes (MYO7A and MYH14). The novel MITF p. Pro338Leu missense mutation was predicted to change the protein structure and function.A novel MITF mutation along with a previously described MYO15A mutation segregate with an autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL case with a post-lingual onset. The findings highlight the importance of carrying whole exome sequencing for a comprehensive assessment of HL genetic heterogeneity."	"Recently, there has been increased studies in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We aimed to make an overview of research trends and genetic polymorphisms for NIHL from 2009 to 2018 with VOSviewer software. A total of 2391 papers were identified for research trends analysis in NIHL and 33 studies identified for a brief review of genetic polymorphisms in human NIHL. The number of publications has been increasing over the past decade. The journal Hearing Research published the most articles (218). The USA contributed the largest number of papers (1042; 43.58%), with the most citations (18,987) and the highest H-index (60). The University of Washington was the most contributive institution. Liberman MC published the most articles (32), and Kujawa SG possessed the highest co-citations (584). Except for high-frequency keywords identified by the software, &quot;prevalence,&quot; &quot;oxidative stress,&quot; &quot;hair cells,&quot; and &quot;cochlear implant&quot; were also the latest research frontiers. HSPA1A rs1043618, HSPA1L rs2227956, PON2 rs12026 and rs7785846, SOD2 rs2855116, KCNE1 rs2070358, KCNQ4 rs34287852, GJB2 rs3751385, PCDH15 rs7095441 and rs11004085, GRHL2 rs1981361, ITGA8 rs10508489, MYH14 rs667907, and POU4F3 rs891969 were the research hotspots and were replicated in independent samples. Inflammation response underlying NIHL has emerged and should be considered as a pioneering field in the future for the prevention of NIHL and conservation of hearing."	"The most common inherited peripheral neuropathy is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), with a prevalence of 1/2500. Other symptoms can be associated to the condition, such as hearing loss. Currently, no global hearing impairment assessment has been determined, and the physiopathology is not well known.The aim of the study was to analyze among a French series of 3,412 patients with inherited peripheral neuropathy (IPN), the ones who also suffer from hearing loss, to establish phenotype-genotype correlations. An NGS strategy for IPN one side and nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) on the other side, were performed.Hearing loss (HL) was present in only 44 patients (1.30%). The clinical data of 27 patients were usable. Demyelinating neuropathy was diagnosed in 15 cases and axonal neuropathy in 12 cases. HL varied from mild to profound. Five cases of auditory neuropathy were noticed. Diagnosis was made for 60% of these patients. Seven novel pathogenic variants were discovered in five different genes: PRPS1; MPZ; SH3TC2; NEFL; and ABHD12. Two patients with PMP22 variant, had also an additional variant in COCH and MYH14 respectively. No pathogenic variant was found at the DFNB1 locus. Genotype-phenotype correlations do exist, especially with SH3TC2, PRPS1, ABHD12, NEFL, and TRPV4.Involvement of PMP22 is not enough to explain hearing loss in patients suffering from IPN. HL can be due to cochlear impairment and/or auditory nerve dysfunction. HL is certainly underdiagnosed, and should be evaluated in every patient suffering from IPN."	"Metastasis is complex, involving multiple genetic, epigenetic, biochemical, and physical changes in the cancer cell and its microenvironment. Cells with metastatic potential are often characterized by altered cellular contractility and deformability, lending them the flexibility to disseminate and navigate through different microenvironments. We demonstrate that mechanoresponsiveness is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer cells. Key mechanoresponsive proteins, those that accumulate in response to mechanical stress, specifically nonmuscle myosin IIA (MYH9) and IIC (MYH14), α-actinin 4, and filamin B, were highly expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared with healthy ductal epithelia. Their less responsive sister paralogs-myosin IIB (MYH10), α-actinin 1, and filamin A-had lower expression differential or disappeared with cancer progression. We demonstrate that proteins whose cellular contributions are often overlooked because of their low abundance can have profound impact on cell architecture, behavior, and mechanics. Here, the low abundant protein MYH14 promoted metastatic behavior and could be exploited with 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP), which increased MYH14 assembly, stiffening cells. As a result, 4-HAP decreased dissemination, induced cortical actin belts in spheroids, and slowed retrograde actin flow. 4-HAP also reduced liver metastases in human pancreatic cancer-bearing nude mice. Thus, increasing MYH14 assembly overwhelms the ability of cells to polarize and invade, suggesting targeting the mechanoresponsive proteins of the actin cytoskeleton as a new strategy to improve the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that mechanoresponsive proteins become upregulated with pancreatic cancer progression and that this system of proteins can be pharmacologically targeted to inhibit the metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells."	"Serum platinum is measurable for years after completion of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBC). We report the largest investigation of serum platinum levels to date of 1,010 testicular cancer survivors (TCS) assessed 1-35 years after CBC and evaluate genetic contributions to these levels.Eligible TCS given 300 or 400 (±15) mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin underwent extensive audiometric testing, clinical examination, completed questionnaires, and had crude serum platinum levels measured. Associations between serum platinum and various risk factors and toxicities were assessed after fitting a biexponential model adjusted for follow-up time and cumulative cisplatin dose. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the serum platinum residuals of the dose and time-adjusted model.Serum platinum levels exceeded the reference range for approximately 31 years, with a strong inverse relationship with creatinine clearance at follow-up (age-adjusted <i>P</i> = 2.13 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). We observed a significant, positive association between residual platinum values and luteinizing hormone (age-adjusted <i>P</i> = 6.58 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). Patients with high residual platinum levels experienced greater Raynaud phenomenon than those with medium or low levels (age-adjusted OR<sub>high/low</sub> = 1.46; <i>P</i> = 0.04), as well as a higher likelihood of developing tinnitus (age-adjusted OR<sub>high/low</sub> = 1.68, <i>P</i> = 0.07). GWAS identified one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) meeting genome-wide significance, rs1377817 (<i>P</i> = 4.6 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, a SNP intronic to <i>MYH14</i>).This study indicates that residual platinum values are correlated with several cisplatin-related toxicities. One genetic variant is associated with these levels."	"Peripheral neuropathies are often caused by disruption of genes responsible for myelination or axonal transport. In particular, impairment in mitochondrial fission and fusion are known causes of peripheral neuropathies. However, the causal mechanisms for peripheral neuropathy gene mutations are not always known. While loss of function mutations in MYH14 typically cause non-syndromic hearing loss, the recently described R941L mutation in MYH14, encoding the non-muscle myosin protein isoform NMIIC, leads to a complex clinical presentation with an unexplained peripheral neuropathy phenotype.Confocal microscopy was used to examine mitochondrial dynamics in MYH14 patient fibroblast cells, as well as U2OS and M17 cells overexpressing NMIIC. The consequence of the R941L mutation on myosin activity was modeled in C. elegans.We describe the third family carrying the R941L mutation in MYH14, and demonstrate that the R941L mutation impairs non-muscle myosin protein function. To better understand the molecular basis of the peripheral neuropathy phenotype associated with the R941L mutation, which has been hindered by the fact that NMIIC is largely uncharacterized, we have established a previously unrecognized biological role for NMIIC in mediating mitochondrial fission in human cells. Notably, the R941L mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit mitochondrial fission, especially in the cell periphery. In addition, we observed alterations to the organization of the mitochondrial genome.As impairments in mitochondrial fission cause peripheral neuropathy, this insight into the function of NMIIC likely explains the peripheral neuropathy phenotype associated with the R941L mutation. FUND: This study was supported by the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Care4Rare Canada Consortium."	"Literature review of the genetic etiology of hearing loss (HL) in the African American (AA) population.PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL were accessed from 1966 to 2018.PRISMA guidelines were followed. Search terms included permutations of &quot;hearing loss,&quot; &quot;African American,&quot; &quot;black,&quot; and &quot;genetic&quot;; &quot;African American&quot; was then cross-referenced against documented HL genes. AA subjects included in multiethnic cohorts of genetic HL testing were identified by searching the key terms &quot;hearing loss&quot; and &quot;ethnic cohort&quot; and &quot;genetic.&quot; The Q-Genie tool was used in the quality assessment of included studies. An allele frequency meta-analysis of pathogenic GJB2 variants in the AA population was performed and stratified by hearing status.Four hundred seventeen articles were reviewed, and 26 met our inclusion criteria. Ten studies were included in the GJB2 meta-analysis. In the general AA population, pathogenic GJB2 variants are rare, including the 35delG allele, which displayed a carrier frequency of 0.05%. Pathogenic variants were discovered in seven nonsyndromic HL genes (GJB2, MYO3A, TECTA, STRC, OTOF, MYH14, TMC1), eight syndromic HL genes, and one mitochondrial HL gene. Recent comprehensive genetic testing using custom genetic HL testing platforms has yielded only a 26% molecular diagnosis rate for HL etiologies in the AA population.Investigators should be encouraged to provide an ethnic breakdown of results. Sparse literature and poor diagnosis rates indicate that genes involved in HL in the AA population have yet to be identified. Future explorative investigations using next-generation sequencing technologies, such as whole-exome sequencing, into the AA population are warranted."	"Late-onset, down-sloping sensorineural hearing loss has many genetic and nongenetic etiologies, but the proportion of this commonly encountered type of hearing loss attributable to genetic causes is not well known. In this study, the authors performed genetic analysis using next-generation sequencing techniques in patients showing late-onset, down-sloping sensorineural hearing loss with preserved low-frequency hearing, and investigated the clinical implications of the variants identified.From a cohort of patients with hearing loss at a tertiary referral hospital, 18 unrelated probands with down-sloping sensorineural hearing loss of late onset were included in this study. Down-sloping hearing loss was defined as a mean low-frequency threshold at 250 Hz and 500 Hz less than or equal to 40 dB HL and a mean high-frequency threshold at 1, 2, and 4 kHz greater than 40 dB HL. The authors performed whole-exome sequencing and segregation analysis to identify the genetic causes and evaluated the outcomes of auditory rehabilitation in the patients.There were nine simplex and nine multiplex families included, in which the causative variants were found in six of 18 probands, demonstrating a detection rate of 33.3%. Various types of variants, including five novel and three known variants, were detected in the MYH14, MYH9, USH2A, COL11A2, and TMPRSS3 genes. The outcome of cochlear and middle ear implants in patients identified with pathogenic variants was satisfactory. There was no statistically significant difference between pathogenic variant-positive and pathogenic variant-negative groups in terms of onset age, family history of hearing loss, pure-tone threshold, or speech discrimination scores.The proportion of patients with late-onset, down-sloping hearing loss identified with potentially causative variants was unexpectedly high. Identification of the causative variants will offer insights on hearing loss progression and prognosis regarding various modes of auditory rehabilitation, as well as possible concomitant syndromic features."	"The mutational spectrum of deafness in Indochina Peninsula, including Vietnam, remains mostly undetermined. This significantly hampers the progress toward establishing an effective genetic screening method and early customized rehabilitation modalities for hearing loss. In this study, we evaluated the genetic profile of severe-to-profound hearing loss in a Vietnamese pediatric population using a hierarchical genetic analysis protocol that screened 11 known deafness-causing variants, followed by massively parallel sequencing targeting 129 deafness-associated genes. Eighty-seven children with isolated severe-to-profound non-syndromic hearing loss without family history were included. The overall molecular diagnostic yield was estimated to be 31.7%. The mutational spectrum for severe-to-profound non-syndromic hearing loss in our Vietnamese population was unique: The most prevalent variants resided in the MYO15A gene (7.2%), followed by GJB2 (6.9%), MYO7A (5.5%), SLC26A4 (4.6%), TMC1 (1.8%), ESPN (1.8%), POU3F4 (1.8%), MYH14 (1.8%), EYA1 (1.8%), and MR-RNR1 (1.1%). The unique spectrum of causative genes in the Vietnamese deaf population was similar to that in the southern Chinese deaf population. It is our hope that the mutation spectrum provided here could aid in establishing an efficient protocol for genetic analysis of severe-to-profound hearing loss and a customized screening kit for the Vietnamese population."	"To explore the molecular epidemiology of rare deafness genes in Taiwanese sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) patients with cochlear implantation (CI) by performing massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and correlating genetic factors and CI outcomes.We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes.Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes.We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI."	"To find the causative mutation by linkage analysisof Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease while focussing on AMACR gene.The case-control study was conducted from November 2016 to March 2017 in Kongju National University Korea.A family of 15 members with composite symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were enrolled. In addition, 50 healthy controls, which had no clinical features and family history of neuromuscular disorders, were also recruited. The family was selected for sequencing analysis by using capillary sequencing. It was sequenced for all the causative genes for CMT disease i.e. PMP22, MPZ, MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, CX32, MYH14, LMNA, TRPV4, LITAF. Various regions of chromosome were suspected based on the logarithm of the odds score.Of the 15-member family, 7(47%) were affected and 8(53%)were unaffected. Those unaffected also acted as the controls. A missense mutation was found in exon 1 of the AMACR gene at p.Gly175Asp position. The mutation was also found in some of the unaffected members as well as in the control samples.As the mutation was found in the healthy samples as well, it can be said that the current mutation AMACR can be involved in some other forms of peripheral neuropathy which can be with other phenotypes."	"The alpha1 (α1) subunit of the sodium/potassium ATPase (i.e., Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1), the prototypical sodium pump, is expressed in each eukaryotic cell. They pump out three sodium ions in exchange for two extracellular potassium ions to establish a cellular electrochemical gradient important for firing of neuronal and cardiac action potentials. We hypothesized that myosin (myo or myh) motor proteins might interact with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 subunits in order for them to play an important role in the transport and trafficking of sodium pump. To this end immunoassays were performed to determine whether class II non-muscle myosins (i.e., NMHC-IIA/myh9, NMHC-IIB/myh10 or NMHC-IIC/myh14), myosin Va (myoVa) and myosin VI (myoVI) would interact with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 subunits. Immunoprecipitation of myh9, myh10, myh14, myoVa and myoVI from rat brain tissues led to the co-immunoprecipitation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 subunits expressed there. Heterologous expression studies using HEK293 cells indicated that recombinant myh9, myh10, myh14 and myoVI interact with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 subunits expressed in HEK293 cells. Additional results indicated that loss of tail regions in recombinant myh9, myh10, myh14 and myoVI did not affect their interaction with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 subunits. However, recombinant myh9, myh10 and myh14 mutants having reduced or no actin binding ability, as a result of loss of their actin binding sites, displayed greatly reduced or null interaction with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 subunits. These results suggested the involvement of the actin binding site, but not tail regions, of NMHC-IIs in their interaction with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 subunits. Overall these results suggest a role for these diverse myosins in the trafficking and transport of sodium pump in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues."	"Three paralogues of nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM 2A, 2B, and 2C) are expressed in mammals, and the heavy chains are the products of three different genes (Myh9, Myh10, and Myh14, respectively). NM 2A and 2B are essential for mouse development, while 2C is not. Studies on NM 2C are limited and the in vivo function of this paralogue is not clear. Using homologous recombination, cDNA encoding nonmuscle myosin heavy chain 2C1 fused with GFP was introduced into the first coding exon of Myh9, replacing NM 2A expression with NM 2C1 expression in mice. In contrast to A<sup>-</sup>/A<sup>-</sup> embryos, which die by embryonic day (E) 6.5, A<sup>C1*gfp</sup>/A<sup>C1*gfp</sup> embryos survive through E8.5, demonstrating that NM 2C1 can support mouse development beyond gastrulation. At E9.5 and E10.5, however, A<sup>C1*gfp</sup>/A<sup>C1*gfp</sup> embryos are developmentally delayed, with abnormalities in placental vascular formation. The defect in vascular formation is confirmed in allantois explants from A<sup>C1*gfp</sup>/A<sup>C1*gfp</sup> embryos. Thus, NM 2C1 cannot support normal placental vascular formation. In addition, A<sup>C1*gfp</sup>/A<sup>C1*gfp</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) migrate rapidly but with impaired persistence and develop smaller, less mature focal adhesions than A<sup>+</sup>/A<sup>+</sup> MEFs. This is attributed to enhanced NM 2C1 actomyosin stability and different NM 2C1 subcellular localization than in NM 2A."	"SOX9 controls cell lineage fate and differentiation in major biological processes. It is known as a potent transcriptional activator of differentiation-specific genes, but its earliest targets and its contribution to priming chromatin for gene activation remain unknown. Here, we address this knowledge gap using chondrogenesis as a model system. By profiling the whole transcriptome and the whole epigenome of wild-type and <i>Sox9</i>-deficient mouse embryo limb buds, we uncover multiple structural and regulatory genes, including <i>Fam101a</i>, <i>Myh14</i>, <i>Sema3c</i> and <i>Sema3d</i>, as specific markers of precartilaginous condensation, and we provide evidence of their direct transactivation by SOX9. Intriguingly, we find that SOX9 helps remove epigenetic signatures of transcriptional repression and establish active-promoter and active-enhancer marks at precartilage- and cartilage-specific loci, but is not absolutely required to initiate these changes and activate transcription. Altogether, these findings widen our current knowledge of SOX9 targets in early chondrogenesis and call for new studies to identify the pioneer and transactivating factors that act upstream of or along with SOX9 to prompt chromatin remodeling and specific gene activation at the onset of chondrogenesis and other processes."	"Cytological examination of urine is the most widely used noninvasive pathologic screen for bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA); however, inadequate diagnostic accuracy remains a major challenge. We performed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of urine samples of ten patients with BLCA and ten paired patients with benign urothelial lesion (BUL) to identify ancillary proteomic markers for use in liquid-based cytology (LBC). A total of 4,839 proteins were identified and 112 proteins were confirmed as expressed at significantly different levels between the two groups. We also performed an independent proteomic profiling of tumor tissue samples where we identified 7,916 proteins of which 758 were differentially expressed. Cross-platform comparisons of these data with comparative mRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas identified four putative candidate proteins, AHNAK, EPPK1, MYH14 and OLFM4. To determine their immunocytochemical expression levels in LBC, we examined protein expression data from The Human Protein Atlas and in-house FFPE samples. We further investigated the expression of the four candidate proteins in urine cytology samples from two independent validation cohorts. These analyses revealed AHNAK as a unique intracellular protein differing in immunohistochemical expression and subcellular localization between tumor and non-tumor cells. In conclusion, this study identified a new biomarker, AHNAK, applicable to discrimination between BLCA and BUL by LBC. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first identification of a clinical biomarker for LBC based on in-depth proteomics."	"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe motor neuron (MN) disease caused by the deletion or mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which results in reduced levels of the SMN protein and the selective degeneration of lower MNs. The best-known function of SMN is the biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs, the major components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. Therefore, SMN deficiency in SMA leads to widespread splicing abnormalities. We used the SMN∆7 mouse model of SMA to investigate the cellular reorganization of polyadenylated mRNAs associated with the splicing dysfunction in MNs. We demonstrate that SMN deficiency induced the abnormal nuclear accumulation in euchromatin domains of poly(A) RNA granules (PARGs) enriched in the splicing regulator Sam68. However, these granules lacked other RNA-binding proteins, such as TDP43, PABPN1, hnRNPA12B, REF and Y14, which are essential for mRNA processing and nuclear export. These effects were accompanied by changes in the alternative splicing of the Sam68-dependent Bcl-x and Nrnx1 genes, as well as changes in the relative accumulation of the intron-containing Chat, Chodl, Myh9 and Myh14 mRNAs, which are all important for MN functions. PARG-containing MNs were observed at presymptomatic SMA stage, increasing their number during the symptomatic stage. Moreover, the massive accumulations of poly(A) RNA granules in MNs was accompanied by the cytoplasmic depletion of polyadenylated mRNAs for their translation. We suggest that the SMN-dependent abnormal accumulation of polyadenylated mRNAs and Sam68 in PARGs reflects a severe dysfunction of both mRNA processing and translation, which could contribute to SMA pathogenesis."

"MYO6"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Postnatal mammalian cochlear hair cells (HCs) can be regenerated by direct transdifferentiation or by mitotic regeneration from supporting cells through many pathways, including Atoh1, Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch signaling. However, most new HCs are immature HCs. In this study we used RNA-Seq analysis to compare the differences between the transcriptomes of <i>Atoh1</i> overexpression-induced new HCs and the native HCs, and to define the factors that might help to promote the maturation of new HCs. As expected, we found <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had obvious HC characteristics as demonstrated by the expression of HC markers such as <i>Pou4f3</i> and Myosin VIIA (Myo7a). However, <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had significantly lower expression of genes that are related to HC function such as Slc26a5 (<i>Prestin</i>), <i>Slc17a8</i> and <i>Otof</i>. We found that genes related to HC cell differentiation and maturation (<i>Kcnma1</i>, <i>Myo6</i>, <i>Myo7a</i>, <i>Grxcr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Wnt5a</i>, <i>Fgfr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Fgf8</i> etc.) had significantly lower expression levels in new HCs compared to native HCs. In conclusion, we found a set of genes that might regulate the differentiation and maturation of new HCs, and these genes might serve as potential new therapeutic targets for functional HC regeneration and hearing recovery."	"Dendrite arbor pattern determines the functional characteristics of a neuron. It is founded on primary branch structure, defined through cell intrinsic and transcription-factor-encoded mechanisms. Developing arbors have extensive acentrosomal microtubule dynamics, and here, we report an unexpected role for the atypical actin motor Myo6 in creating primary branch structure by specifying the position, polarity, and targeting of these events. We carried out in vivo time-lapse imaging of Drosophila adult sensory neuron differentiation, integrating machine-learning-based quantification of arbor patterning with molecular-level tracking of cytoskeletal remodeling. This revealed that Myo6 and the transcription factor Knot regulate transient surges of microtubule polymerization at dendrite tips; they drive retrograde extension of an actin filament array that specifies anterograde microtubule polymerization and guides these microtubules to subdivide the tip into multiple branches. Primary branches delineate functional compartments; this tunable branching mechanism is key to define and diversify dendrite arbor compartmentalization."	"<i>MYO6</i> is known as a genetic cause of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inherited hearing loss. In this study, to clarify the frequency and clinical characteristics of hearing loss caused by <i>MYO6</i> gene mutations, a large-scale genetic analysis of Japanese patients with hearing loss was performed. By means of massively parallel DNA sequencing (MPS) using next-generation sequencing for 8074 Japanese families, we found 27 <i>MYO6</i> variants in 33 families, 22 of which are novel. In total, 2.40% of autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss (ADSNHL) in families in this study (32 out of 1336) was found to be caused by <i>MYO6</i> mutations. The present study clarified that most cases showed juvenile-onset progressive hearing loss and their hearing deteriorated markedly after 40 years of age. The estimated hearing deterioration was found to be 0.57 dB per year; when restricted to change after 40 years of age, the deterioration speed was accelerated to 1.07 dB per year. To obtain supportive evidence for pathogenicity, variants identified in the patients were introduced to <i>MYO6</i> cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and overexpressed in epithelial cells. They were then assessed for their effects on espin1-induced microvilli formation. Cells with wildtype myosin 6 and espin1 co-expressed created long microvilli, while co-expression with mutant constructs resulted in severely shortened microvilli. In conclusion, the present data clearly showed that <i>MYO6</i> is one of the genes to keep in mind with regard to ADSNHL, and the molecular characteristics of the identified gene variants suggest that a possible pathology seems to result from malformed stereocilia of the cochlear hair cells."	"The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) is dysregulated in many types of tumors; however, its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the effect of lncRNA UCA1 on OSCC.Fifty-six paired OSCC and adjacent nontumorous tissues were collected and the levels of UCA1, miR-143-3p, and MYO6 in the tissues were evaluated by qRT-PCR. In in vitro experiments, cell viability, migration, and invasion were measured by, respectively, performing CCK-8, wound healing, and transwell assays. The target relationships among UCA1, miR-143-3p, and MYO6 were verified by dual-luciferase assay. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were carried out to determine the protein levels. Xenograft mouse model was established to explore the effects of UCA1 in vivo.Levels of UCA1 and MYO6 were increased significantly in OSCC, while the level of miR-143-3p was decreased compared with the adjacent nontumorous tissues. UCA1 promoted OSCC cell growth, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo, while miR-143-3p reversed the progression. MYO6 was validated as a target for miR-143-3p, and MYO6 overexpression reversed the effects of miR-143-3p mimic on OSCC cells.LncRNA UCA1 contributes to the proliferation and metastasis of OSCC cells by targeting miR-143-3p and upregulating its downstream gene MYO6. UCA1 could serve as a promising novel target therapy for treatment of OSCC."	"Accumulating evidence determined that lncRNAs play multiple roles in cell progression in colorectal cancer (CRC). Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox A (HNF1A)-antisense RNA 1 (AS1) has been identified to affect cell growth and disease diagnosis in various cancers, including CRC. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of HNF1A-AS1 in cell progression and glycolysis has not been fully explored in CRC.The expression of HNF1A-AS1, microRNA-124 (miR-124) and Myosins of class VI (MYO6) was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The analysis of glucose consumption, lactate production and hexokinase 2 (HK2) protein level was used to assess glycolysis in cells. The protein level of HK2 and MYO6 was measured with Western blot. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using the transwell assay. The relationship among HNF1A-AS1, miR-124 and MYO6 was determined via luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay.In this study, we found that HNF1A-AS1 was upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. Functional experiments determined that reduction of HNF1A-AS1 or promotion of miR-124 inhibited cell migration and invasion as well as glycolysis in CRC cells. What' more, luciferase reporter assay manifested that miR-124 was a target of HNF1A-AS1 and MYO6 was a target mRNA of miR-124 in CRC cells. Additionally, reverse experiments showed that the effects of si-HNF1A-AS1 on colorectal cancer cells were impaired by anti-miR-124 and the effects of high miR-124 expression on CRC cells were rescued by upregulating MYO6. HNF1A-AS1 regulated MYO6 expression via targeting miR-124 in CRC cells.In this study, we first found that HNF1A-AS1 regulated cell migration, invasion and glycolysis via modulating miR-124/MYO6 in CRC cells."	"Myosin X (Myo10) has several unique design features including dimerization via an anti-parallel coiled coil and a long lever arm, which allow it to preferentially move on actin bundles. To understand the stepping behavior of single Myo10 on actin bundles, we labeled two heads of Myo10 dimers with different fluorophores. Unlike previously described for myosin V (Myo5) and VI (Myo6), which display alternating hand-over-hand stepping, Myo10 frequently took near simultaneous steps of both heads, and less frequently, 2-3 steps of one head before the other head stepped. We suggest that this behavior results from the unusual kinetic features of Myo10, in conjunction with the structural properties of the motor domain/lever arm, which will favor movement on actin bundles rather than on single filaments."	"We report a large family with four successive generations, presenting with a complex phenotype of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), partially penetrant monocytosis, and hearing loss of varying severity.We performed whole exome sequencing to identify the causative variants. Sanger sequencing was used to perform segregation analyses on remaining family members.We identified and classified a pathogenic GFI1 variant and a likely pathogenic variant in MYO6 which together explain the complex phenotypes seen in this family.We present a case illustrating the benefits of a broad screening approach that allows identification of oligogenic determinants of complex human phenotypes which may have been missed if the screening was limited to a targeted gene panel with the assumption of a syndromic disorder. This is important for correct genetic diagnosis of families and disentangling the range and severity of phenotypes associated with high impact variants."	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. In this study, we characterized the clinical features of 12 Chinese Han deaf families in which mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1 were excluded.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 147 known deafness genes was performed in probands of 10 families, while whole-exome sequencing was applied in those of the rest two.Pathogenic mutations in a total of 11 rare deafness genes, OTOF, CDH23, PCDH15, PDZD7, ADGRV1, KARS, OTOG, GRXCR2, MYO6, GRHL2, and POU3F4, were identified in all 12 probands, with 16 mutations being novel. Intrafamilial cosegregation of the mutations and the deafness phenotype were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Our results expanded the mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation of nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese Hans and also emphasized the importance of combining both next-generation sequencing and detailed auditory evaluation to achieve a more accurate diagnosis for nonsyndromic hearing loss."	"Exosomes mediate cell-cell crosstalk in cancer progression by transferring a variety of biomolecules, including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Long non-coding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated (UCA1) is a well-known lncRNA associated with the development and progression of various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the presence of UCA1 in exosomes and the roles and clinical values of exosomal UCA1 in CRC remain unknown. In this study, we systematically analyzed the expression profiles of exosomal lncRNAs in CRC patients using a high-throughput microarray assay. Then, we evaluated the UCA1 expression levels in a series of CRC tissues and the serum exosomes of CRC patients using quantitative real-time PCR. The roles of UCA1 on CRC in vitro and in vivo were investigated by MTT, colony formation, Transwell, quantitative real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and western blotting. The miRNA binding sites of UCA1 were predicted using the miRcode online database, and miR-143 was validated to target UCA1 by dual-luciferase activity assay and AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation. Finally, the role of exosome-mediated UCA1 was further investigated by co-culturing with CRC cells. This study showed that UCA1 was upregulated in CRC tissues and functioned as an oncogene in CRC. Loss-of-function investigations showed that inhibition of UCA1 suppressed CRC cell proliferation and metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, UCA1 was identified as a miR-143 sponge. We also found that MYO6 was a direct target of miR-1205, which functioned as an oncogene in CRC. Moreover, UCA was also upregulated in the serum exosomes of CRC patients and could transfer UCA1 to CRC cells to increase their abilities of cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, these data suggest that UCA1 could be an oncogene for CRC and may serve as a candidate target for new therapies in human CRC."	"UCA1 (urothelial carcinoma associated 1) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that was found overexpressed in various human cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the aspect of UCA1-miRNA-mRNA interaction in PCa remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed the role of UCA1 in PCa and found that UCA1 downregulation inhibited cell proliferation of PCa cells. Then we demonstrated that repressed UCA1 promoted the microRNA-143 (miR-143) expression and miR-143 could bind to the predicted binding site of UCA1. We then proved the anti-tumor role of miR-143 in PCa. Furthermore, we found that miR-143 displays its role in PCa via modulating the MYO6 expression. In summary, our study demonstrated that UCA1 exerts oncogenes activity in PCa, acting mechanistically by upregulating MYO6 expression through &quot;sponging&quot; miR-143."	"Myosin VI (MYO6) is an actin-based motor that has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes, including endocytosis and the regulation of actin dynamics. MYO6 is crucial for actin/membrane remodeling during the final step of Drosophila spermatogenesis, and MYO6-deficient males are sterile. This protein also localizes to actin-rich structures involved in mouse spermiogenesis. Although loss of MYO6 in Snell's waltzer knock-out (KO) mice causes several defects and shows reduced male fertility, no studies have been published to address the role of MYO6 in sperm development in mouse. Here we demonstrate that MYO6 and some of its binding partners are present at highly specialized actin-based structures, the apical tubulobulbar complexes (TBCs), which mediate endocytosis of the intercellular junctions at the Sertoli cell-spermatid interface, an essential process for sperm release. Using electron and light microscopy and biochemical approaches, we show that MYO6, GIPC1 and TOM1/L2 form a complex in testis and localize predominantly to an early endocytic APPL1-positive compartment of the TBCs that is distinct from EEA1-positive early endosomes. These proteins also associate with the TBC actin-free bulbular region. Finally, our studies using testis from Snell's waltzer males show that loss of MYO6 causes disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and disorganization of the TBCs and leads to defects in the distribution of the MYO6-positive early APPL1-endosomes. Taken together, we report here for the first time that lack of MYO6 in mouse testis reduces male fertility and disrupts spatial organization of the TBC-related endocytic compartment during the late phase of spermiogenesis."	"Copy number variation is an extensively studied cause of hereditary diseases. However, its role in hereditary sensorineural deafness has been rarely reported. Using targeted sequencing, SNP array and qPCR, we found a novel 622.2 kb duplication of 6q14.1 in a patient with congenital sensorineural hearing loss and cochlear aplasia. The duplication included MYO6 and IMPG1 genes. FISH study confirmed that this duplication was inherited from the patient's mosaic mother."	"As a major cause of morbidity and mortality among men, prostate cancer is a heterogenous disease, with a vast heterogeneity in the biology of the disease and in clinical outcome. While it often runs an indolent course, local progression or metastasis may eventually develop, even among patients considered &quot;low risk&quot; at diagnosis. Therefore, biomarkers that can discriminate aggressive from indolent disease at an early stage would greatly benefit patients. We hypothesized that tissue specimens from early stage prostate cancers may harbor predictive signatures for disease progression.We used a cohort of radical prostatectomy patients with longitudinal follow-up, who had tumors with low grade and stage that revealed no signs of future disease progression at surgery. During the follow-up period, some patients either remained indolent (non-BCR) or progressed to biochemical recurrence (BCR). Total RNA was extracted from tumor, and adjacent normal epithelium of formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Differential gene expression in tumors, and in tumor versus normal tissues between BCR and non-BCR patients were analyzed by NanoString using a customized CodeSet of 151 probes.After controlling for false discovery rates, we identified a panel of eight genes (<i>ERG, GGT1, HDAC1, KLK2, MYO6, PLA2G7, BICD1</i> and <i>CACNAID</i>) that distinguished BCR from non-BCR patients. We found a clear association of ERG expression with non-BCR, which was further corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assays.Our results identified ERG as the strongest predictor for BCR and showed that potential prognostic prostate cancer biomarkers can be identified from FFPE tumor specimens."	"Myosin VI is an actin-based cytoskeletal motor implicated in various steps of membrane trafficking. Here, we investigated whether this myosin is crucial for synaptic function and plasticity in neurons. We find that myosin VI localizes at cerebellar parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses and that the myosin is indispensable for long-term depression of AMPA-receptor-mediated synaptic signal transmission at this synapse. Moreover, direct visualization of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors in Purkinje cells reveals that the myosin drives removal of AMPA receptors from the surface of dendritic spines in an activity-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation and super-resolution microscopy indicate that specifically the interaction of myosin VI with the clathrin adaptor component α-adaptin is important during long-term depression. Together, these data suggest that myosin VI directly promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors in Purkinje cells to mediate cerebellar long-term depression. Our results provide insights into myosin VI function and the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity."	"Myosins of class VI (MYO6) are unique actin-based motor proteins that move cargo towards the minus ends of actin filaments. As the sole myosin with this directionality, it is critically important in a number of biological processes. Indeed, loss or overexpression of MYO6 in humans is linked to a variety of pathologies including deafness, cardiomyopathy, neurodegenerative diseases as well as cancer. This myosin interacts with a wide variety of direct binding partners such as for example the selective autophagy receptors optineurin, TAX1BP1 and NDP52 and also Dab2, GIPC, TOM1 and LMTK2, which mediate distinct functions of different MYO6 isoforms along the endocytic pathway. Functional proteomics has recently been used to identify the wider MYO6 interactome including several large functionally distinct multi-protein complexes, which highlight the importance of this myosin in regulating the actin and septin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, adaptor-binding not only triggers cargo attachment, but also controls the inactive folded conformation and dimerisation of MYO6. Thus, the C-terminal tail domain mediates cargo recognition and binding, but is also crucial for modulating motor activity and regulating cytoskeletal track dynamics."	"Myosin VI is an actin-associated molecular motor vital for auditory and vestibular function. It is encoded by MYO6 located on chromosome 6q13 in human. Pathogenic variants in MYO6 have been associated with both dominant and recessive forms of hearing loss. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We established a humanized knock-in mouse model, Myo6-C442Y, to mimic the p.C442Y missense variant identified in human patients with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss designated as DFNA22. We characterized hearing and inner ear morphologies of Myo6-C442Y and wild-type control mice. We found that both homozygous and heterozygous Myo6-C442Y mice exhibited hearing loss from three weeks after birth that rapidly progressed to profound deafness by six to nine weeks of age. The hearing loss corresponded to the degeneration of hair cells in the organ of Corti. We also observed disorganized stereocilia with irregular morphological features by immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, hearing loss and inner-ear morphological anomalies were more pronounced and deteriorated more drastically in homozygous than in heterozygous Myo6-C442Y mice, indicating a semi-dominant inheritance pattern. Heterozygous Myo6-C442Y mice recapitulated the progressive postlingual sensorineural deafness in human, thus providing a useful model for elucidating the role myosin VI plays in the mammalian auditory system. Furthermore, the late-onset hearing loss of this mouse model may provide a therapeutic window for the emerging gene therapy, a promising strategy to treat certain forms of genetic deafness."	"In this study, we aimed to identify the myosin motor proteins that control trafficking at the Golgi complex. In addition to the known Golgi-associated myosins MYO6, MYO18A and MYH9 (myosin IIA), we identified MYO1C as a novel player at the Golgi in a human cell line. We demonstrate that depletion of <i>MYO1C</i> induces Golgi complex fragmentation and decompaction. MYO1C accumulates at dynamic structures around the Golgi complex that colocalize with Golgi-associated actin dots. <i>MYO1C</i> depletion leads to loss of cellular F-actin, and Golgi complex decompaction is also observed after inhibition or loss of the actin-related protein 2/3 complex, Arp2/3 (also known as ARPC). We show that the functional consequence of <i>MYO1C</i> depletion is a delay in the arrival of incoming transport carriers, both from the anterograde and retrograde routes. We propose that MYO1C stabilizes actin at the Golgi complex, facilitating the arrival of incoming transport carriers at the Golgi.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper."	"Hearing loss (HL) is the most prevalent sensory disorder. The over 100 genes implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) makes it difficult to analyze and determine the accurate genetic causes of hearing loss. We sought to de?ne the frequency of seven hearing loss-Causing causing genetic Variants in four genes in an Iranian population with hearing loss.One hundred ARNSHL patients with normal GJB2/GJB6 genes were included, and targeted mutations in SLC26A4, MYO6, PJVK and CDH23 genes were analyzed by ARMS-PCR. The negative and positive results were confirmed by the Sanger sequencing.We found only two mutations, one in MYO6 (c.554-1 G &gt; A) gene and another in PJVK (c.547C &gt; T).c.554-1G &gt; A and c.547C &gt; T mutations are responsible for 1% each of the Iranian ARNSHL patients. These genes are not a frequent cause of ARNSHL in an Iranian population."	"MiRNA-5195-3p (miR-5195-3p), a recently discovered and poorly studied miRNA, has been reported to suppress bladder cancer cell behavior. However, its regulatory role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. Here, the expression of miR-5195-3p was found to be reduced in NSCLC tissues and cells. The in vitro experiments showed that miR-5195-3p upregulation repressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion by CCK-8 and transwell assays. In addition, MYO6 was predicted and confirmed as a potential target of miR-5195-3p by Bioinformatics analysis, Luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis. There was significantly negative correlation between miR-5195-3p and MYO6 in NSCLC tissues. Furthermore, MYO6 knockdown exhibited similar effects to those of miR-5195-3p overexpression in NSCLC cells, and restored MYO6 expression reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-5195-3p. Therefore, these results demonstrate that miR-5195-3p functions as a tumor suppressor by directly modulating MYO6 expression in NSCLC cells, and may be an innovative candidate target for NSCLC therapy."	"Autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) is characterized by postlingual progressive onset. Due to its high genetic heterogeneity, it is difficult to perform a molecular diagnosis for most patients with ADNSHL. In our study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to screen pathogenic gene candidates by analyzing genomic DNA samples from a large Chinese family (JSNY-067), including the proband and her father, who suffered from non-syndromic hearing loss. The pathogenicity of candidate nonsynonymous variants in ADNSHL genes was evaluated by co-segregation analysis in family members by direct PCR and Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, multiple in silico analyses (SIFT, Polyphen2, PROVEAN and MutationTaster) and molecular dynamics simulation were used to assess the potential pathogenicity of the candidate mutations. We identified a novel causative mutation, c.622A&gt;G in MYO6 (DFNA22), that resulted in a p.K208E substitution. This mutation co-segregated with the hearing loss phenotype in extended family members, and was predicted to be pathogenic by SIFT, PolyPhen2, PROVEAN and MutationTaster. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation analysis revealed that the p.K208E substitution had a limited influence on the whole protein structure and stability, but that it could affect the locations of the sidechains of nearby hydrophilic residues, which in turn resulted in the sidechains of Asn186 and Glu190 being exposed more frequently at the surface of the protein. WES has thus been shown to be a useful molecular diagnostic tool in screening uncommon gene mutations associated with hereditary hearing loss."
"MYO7A"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is an extremely heterogeneous disorder. Thus, clinical diagnostics is challenging, in particular due to differences in the etiology of hearing loss between populations. With this study, we wanted to elucidate the genetic basis of hearing loss in 61 consanguineous Egyptian families. In 25 families, linkage analysis was used as a prescreening to identify regions for targeted sequencing of candidate genes. Initially, the coding regions of 12 and later of 94 genes associated with hearing loss were enriched and subjected to massively parallel sequencing (MPS) with diagnostic yields of 36% and 75%, respectively. Causative variants were identified in 48 families (79%). They were found in 23 different genes with the majority being located in MYO15A (15.3%), SLC26A4 (9.7%), GJB2 (8.3%), and MYO7A (6.4%). As many as 32 variants were novel ones at the time of detection. Five variants were shared by two, three, or even four families. Our study provides a first survey of the mutational spectrum of deaf patients in Egypt revealing less GJB2 variants than in many European populations. It underlines the value of targeted enrichment of well-selected deafness genes in combination with MPS in the diagnostics of this frequent and genetically heterogeneous disorder."	"To detect potential variants in a family affected with Usher syndrome type I, and analyze its genotype-phenotype correlation.Clinical data of the family was collected. Potential variants in the proband were detected by high-throughput sequencing. Suspected variants were verified by Sanger sequencing.The proband developed night blindness at 10 year old, in addition with bilateral cataract and retinal degeneration. Hearing loss occurred along with increase of age. High-throughput sequencing and Sanger sequencing revealed that she has carried compound heterozygous variants of the MYO7A gene, namely c.2694+2T&gt;G and c.6028G&gt;A. Her sister carried the same variants with similar clinical phenotypes. Her daughter was heterozygous for the c.6028G&gt;A variant but was phenotypically normal.The clinical features and genetic variants were delineated in this family with Usher syndrome type I. The results have enriched the phenotype and genotype data of the disease and provided a basis for genetic counseling."	"Postnatal mammalian cochlear hair cells (HCs) can be regenerated by direct transdifferentiation or by mitotic regeneration from supporting cells through many pathways, including Atoh1, Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch signaling. However, most new HCs are immature HCs. In this study we used RNA-Seq analysis to compare the differences between the transcriptomes of <i>Atoh1</i> overexpression-induced new HCs and the native HCs, and to define the factors that might help to promote the maturation of new HCs. As expected, we found <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had obvious HC characteristics as demonstrated by the expression of HC markers such as <i>Pou4f3</i> and Myosin VIIA (Myo7a). However, <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had significantly lower expression of genes that are related to HC function such as Slc26a5 (<i>Prestin</i>), <i>Slc17a8</i> and <i>Otof</i>. We found that genes related to HC cell differentiation and maturation (<i>Kcnma1</i>, <i>Myo6</i>, <i>Myo7a</i>, <i>Grxcr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Wnt5a</i>, <i>Fgfr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Fgf8</i> etc.) had significantly lower expression levels in new HCs compared to native HCs. In conclusion, we found a set of genes that might regulate the differentiation and maturation of new HCs, and these genes might serve as potential new therapeutic targets for functional HC regeneration and hearing recovery."	"<b>Background:</b> Recent advances in less-invasive surgery and electrode design allow for a high degree of hearing preservation (HP) after cochlear implantation (CI), although residual hearing still deteriorates in some patients. To date, the factors predictive of preserving residual hearing remain a controversial topic.<b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive factors, including the etiology of hearing loss (HL) as a patient-related factor, influencing residual HP after CI.<b>Methods:</b> Forty-four patients (50 ears, 41 families) with residual acoustic hearing who underwent CI were included. Auditory thresholds before and at 6 months after initial activation were measured. Genetic testing was performed to identify the responsible genes for HL.<b>Results:</b> We identified the cause of HL in 21 families (51.2%). HP was marginally correlated with age at implantation, while it was independent of pre-operative low-frequency hearing thresholds, cochlear duct length, and electrode length. We found that patients who had pathogenic variants in the <i>CDH23</i>, <i>MYO7A</i>, or <i>MYO15A</i> gene showed statistically better HP scores compared with patients with HL due to other causes (<i>p</i> = .002).<b>Conclusions:</b> Identification of the etiology of HL using genetic testing is likely to facilitate the prediction of HP after implant surgery."	"The phenotype of DFNA11 consists of specific features at diverse developmental and age stages.Only eight mutations have been identified for autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss related to MYO7A (DFNA11), and the onset and progression of DFNA11 are poorly understood.After linkage analysis and following Sanger sequencing in a family suspected to have autosomal dominant hereditary hearing loss, we analyzed the audiometric and vestibular functions and their long-term changes in the subjects carrying the variant.A reported variant of uncertain significance, NP_000251.3:p.Arg853His, in MYO7A was detected and cosegregation data of this large family provided evidence that the variant was likely pathogenic for DFNA11. Family members with the variant had no other symptoms associated with hearing loss and were confirmed to have autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Audiograms tended to show gently sloping configuration in childhood and flat configuration after the age of 30 years. Hearing loss at high frequencies progressed slowly, while hearing at low frequencies started to deteriorate later but progressed more rapidly. Some subjects showed partly abnormal results in the distortion products of otoacoustic emissions before the elevation of hearing thresholds. Vestibular function was within the normal range in all the subjects tested.We revealed that hearing loss at high frequencies was mainly noted in early developmental stages and that thresholds increased more rapidly in the low frequency range, resulting in changes in audiometric configuration. Deterioration of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) before the elevation of hearing thresholds was considered as a clinical feature of DFNA11."	"<b>Background:</b> Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory disorder in humans, which affects individuals in both inherited and acquired forms. MYO15A and MYO7A gene mutations have a significant role in the development of deafness. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of MYO15A and MYO7A mutations in one hundred non-relative deaf Iranians. <b>Materials and methods:</b> The existence of MYO15A and MYO7A mutations were assessed using the tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method, High Resolution Melting (HRM) and sequencing method. <b>Results:</b> A heterozygote missense mutation, p.V2135L (c.6403G &gt; T) in the MYO15A gene, was found in a patient using the sequencing method. <b>Conclusion:</b> These results explain the negligible prevalence of selected mutations among Iranian patients. Identifying common mutations in patients of an ethnic group can reduce the financial costs and time needed for identifying the causes of deafness."	"Due to improved phenotyping and genetic characterization, the field of 'incurable' and 'blinding' inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) has moved substantially forward. Decades of ascertainment of IRD patient data from Philadelphia and Toronto centers illustrate the progress from Mendelian genetic types to molecular diagnoses. Molecular genetics have been used not only to clarify diagnoses and to direct counseling but also to enable the first clinical trials of gene-based treatment in these diseases. An overview of the recent reports of gene augmentation clinical trials by subretinal injections is used to reflect on the reasons why there has been limited success in this early venture into therapy. These first-in human experiences have taught that there is a need for advancing the techniques of delivery of the gene products - not only for refining further subretinal trials, but also for evaluating intravitreal delivery. Candidate IRDs for intravitreal gene delivery are then suggested to illustrate some of the disorders that may be amenable to improvement of remaining central vision with the least photoreceptor trauma. A more detailed understanding of the human IRDs to be considered for therapy and the calculated potential for efficacy should be among the routine prerequisites for initiating a clinical trial."	"Hearing loss (HL) represents the most common congenital sensory impairment with an incidence of 1-5 per 1000 live births. Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is an isolated finding that is not part of any other disorder accounting for 70% of all genetic hearing loss cases.In the current study, we reported a polygenic mode of inheritance in an NSHL consanguineous family using exome sequencing technology and we evaluated the possible effect of the detected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using in silico methods.Two bi-allelic SNVs were detected in the affected patients; a MYO15A (. p.V485A) variant, and a novel MITF (p.P338L) variant. Along with these homozygous mutations, we detected two heterozygous variants in well described hearing loss genes (MYO7A and MYH14). The novel MITF p. Pro338Leu missense mutation was predicted to change the protein structure and function.A novel MITF mutation along with a previously described MYO15A mutation segregate with an autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL case with a post-lingual onset. The findings highlight the importance of carrying whole exome sequencing for a comprehensive assessment of HL genetic heterogeneity."	"Diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss (HHL) as a heterogeneous disorder is very important especially in countries with high rates of consanguinity where the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance is prevalent. Techniques such as next-generation sequencing, a comprehensive genetic test using targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE + MPS), have made the diagnosis more cost-effective. The aim of this study was to determine HHL variants with comprehensive genetic testing in our country.Fifty <i>GJB2</i> negative individuals with HHL were referred to the Kariminejad-Najmabadi Pathology and Genetics Center, Tehran, one of the reference diagnostic genetic laboratories in Iran, during a 3-year period between 2014 and 2017. They were screened with the OtoSCOPE test, the targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE + MPS) platform after a detailed history had been taken along with clinical evaluation.Among 32 out of 50 <i>GJB2</i> negative patients (64%), 34 known pathogenic and novel variants were detected of which 16 (47%) were novel, identified in 10 genes of which the most prevalent were <i>CDH23, MYO7A</i> and <i>MYO15A.</i>These results provide a foundation from which to make appropriate recommendations for the use of comprehensive genetic testing in the evaluation of Iranian patients with hereditary hearing loss."	"Usher's syndrome is the most common combined blindness-deafness disorder with USH1B, caused by mutations in <i>MYO7A</i>, resulting in the most severe phenotype. The existence of numerous, naturally occurring <i>shaker1</i> mice harboring variable <i>MYO7A</i> mutations on different genetic backgrounds has complicated the characterization of MYO7A knockout (KO) and heterozygote mice. We generated a novel MYO7A KO mouse (<i>Myo7a</i><sup>-</sup><i>                        <sup>/</sup>                    </i><sup>-</sup>) that is easily genotyped, maintained, and confirmed to be null for MYO7A in both the eye and inner ear. Like USH1B patients, <i>Myo7a</i><sup>-</sup><i>                        <sup>/</sup>                    </i><sup>-</sup> mice are profoundly deaf, and display near complete loss of inner and outer cochlear hair cells (HCs). No gross structural changes were observed in vestibular HCs. <i>Myo7a</i><sup>-</sup><i>                        <sup>/</sup>                    </i><sup>-</sup> mice exhibited modest declines in retinal function but, unlike patients, no loss of retinal structure. We attribute the latter to differential expression of MYO7A in mouse vs. primate retina. Interestingly, heterozygous <i>Myo7a</i><sup>+</sup><i>                        <sup>/</sup>                    </i><sup>-</sup> mice had reduced numbers of cochlear HCs and concomitant reductions in auditory function relative to <i>Myo7a</i><sup>+/+</sup> controls. Notably, this is the first report that loss of a single <i>Myo7a</i> allele significantly alters auditory structure and function and suggests that audiological characterization of USH1B carriers is warranted. Maintenance of vestibular HCs in <i>Myo7a</i><sup>-</sup><i>                        <sup>/</sup>                    </i><sup>-</sup> mice suggests that gene replacement could be used to correct the vestibular dysfunction in USH1B patients. While <i>Myo7a</i><sup>-</sup><i>                        <sup>/</sup>                    </i><sup>-</sup> mice do not exhibit sufficiently robust retinal phenotypes to be used as a therapeutic outcome measure, they can be used to assess expression of vectored <i>MYO7A</i> on a null background and generate valuable pre-clinical data toward the treatment of USH1B."	"The effects of noise-induced hearing loss have yet to be studied for the Dutch-belted strain of rabbits, which is the only strain that has been used in studies of the central auditory system. We measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), 2f<sub>1</sub>-f<sub>2</sub> distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and counts of cochlear inner and outer hair cells (IHCs and OHCs, respectively) from confocal images of Myo7a-stained cochlear whole-mounts in unexposed and noise-overexposed, Dutch-belted, male and female rabbits in order to characterize cochlear function and structure under normal-hearing and hearing-loss conditions. Using an octave-band noise exposure centered at 750 Hz presented under isoflurane anesthesia, we found that a sound level of 133 dB SPL for 60 min was minimally sufficient to produce permanent ABR threshold shifts. Overexposure durations of 60 and 90 min caused median click-evoked ABR threshold shifts of 10 and 50 dB, respectively. Susceptibility to overexposure was highly variable across ears, but less variable across test frequencies within the same ear. ABR and DPOAE threshold shifts were smaller, on average, and more variable in male than female ears. Similarly, post-exposure survival of OHCs was higher, on average, and more variable in male than female ears. We paired post-exposure ABR and DPOAE threshold shift data with hair cell count data measured in the same ear at the same frequency and cochlear frequency location. ABR and DPOAE threshold shifts exhibited critical values of 46 and 18 dB, respectively, below which the majority of OHCs and IHCs survived and above which OHCs were wiped out while IHC survival was variable. Our data may be of use to researchers who wish to use Dutch-belted rabbits as a model for the effects of noise-induced hearing loss on the central auditory system."	"The mechanism underlying hair cell (HC) regeneration in the mammalian inner ear is still under debate. Understanding what molecules regulate the HC regeneration in mature mammals will be the key to the treatment of the inner ear disorder. Musashi1 (MSI1) is an RNA binding protein associated with asymmetric division and maintenance of stem cell function as a modulator of the Notch-1 signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the cellular proliferative activity and changes in spatiotemporal pattern of MSI1 expression in the gentamicin (GM)-treated crista ampullaris (CA) in guinea pigs. Although the vestibular HCs in the CA almost disappeared at 14 days after injecting GM in the inner ear, the density of vestibular HCs spontaneously increased by up to 50% relative to controls at 56 days post-GM treatment (PT). The number of the type II HCs was significantly increased at 28 days PT relative to 14 days PT (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) while that of type I HCs or supporting cells (SCs) did not change. The number of SCs did not change through the observational period. Administration of bromodeoxyuridine with the same GM treatment showed that the cell proliferation activity was high in SCs between 14 and 28 days PT. The changes in spatiotemporal patterns of MSI1 expression during spontaneous HC regeneration following GM treatment showed that MSI1-immunoreactivity was diffusely spread into the cytoplasm of the SCs during 7-21 days PT whereas the expression of MSI1 was confined to the nucleus of SCs in the other period. The MSI1/MYO7A double-positive cells were observed at 21 days PT. These results suggest that regeneration of vestibular HCs might originate in the asymmetric cell division and differentiation of SCs and that MSI1 might be involved in controlling the process of vestibular HC regeneration."	"Hair cell stereocilia tip-links function to sense mechanical forces generated by sound waves and maintain the structure of stereocilia by rooting the tail of cadherins to highly dense structures known as tip-link densities. Although the molecular components are largely known, the mechanisms underlying the tip-link density formation are unknown. Here, we show that Myosin VIIB (MYO7B), USH1C, and ANKS4B, which form a specific complex stabilizing tip-links in intestine microvilli, could form dense condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and in cells. The MYO7A, USH1C, and USH1G complex also undergoes phase separation in cells. Formation of the MYO7A/USH1C/USH1G and MYO7B/USH1C/ANKS4B condensates requires strong and multivalent interactions between proteins in both tripartite complexes. Point mutations of MYO7A found in Usher syndrome patients weaken or even disrupt the multivalent interactions of the MYO7A/USH1C/USH1G complex and impair its phase separation. Thus, the stereocilia tip-link densities may form via phase separation of the MYO7A/USH1C/USH1G complex."	"To explore the genetic basis for a family with non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness.The proband and her parents were subjected to physical and audiological examinations. With genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples, next-generation sequencing was carried out using a panel for deafness genes. Suspected mutation was validated by Sanger sequencing and qPCR analysis of her parents.The proband presented bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss at three days after birth. Her auditory threshold was 110-120 dBnHL but with absence of vestibular and retinal symptoms. Her brother also had deafness but her parents were normal. No abnormality was found upon physical examination of her family members, while audiological examination showed no middle ear or retrocochlear diseases. Next-generation sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations of the MYO7A gene, including a previously known c.462C&gt;A (p. Cys154Ter) and a novel EX43_46 Del, which were respectively derived from her mother and father.The compound heterozygous mutations of the MYO7A gene probably underlie the disease in this family. Our findings has enriched the mutation spectrum for non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness 2."	"Genetic causes of hearing loss are highly heterogeneous and often ethnically specific. In recent years, a variety of next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels have been developed to target deafness-causative genes. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), on the other hand, was rarely used for genetic testing for deafness. In this study, we performed WES in 38 sporadic Chinese Han deaf patients who have been pre-excluded for mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4 and MT-RNR1. Non-synonymous variants have been filtered based on their minor allele frequencies in public databases and ethnically matched controls. Bi-allelic pathogenic mutations in eight deafness genes, OTOF, TRIOBP, ESPN, HARS2, CDH23, MYO7A, USH1C and TJP2, were identified in 10 patients, with 17 mutations identified in this study not being associated with deafness previously. For the rest 28 patients, possibly bi-allelic rare non-synonymous variants in an averaged 4.7 genes per patient were identified as candidate pathogenic causes for future analysis. Our study showed that WES may provide a unified platform for genetic testing of deafness and enables retro-analyzing when new causative genes are revealed."	"To document the rod-cone dystrophy phenotype of patients with Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1) harboring MYO7A mutations.Retrospective cohort study of 53 patients (42 families) with biallelic MYO7A mutations who underwent comprehensive examination, including functional visual tests and multimodal retinal imaging. Genetic analysis was performed either using a multiplex amplicon panel or through direct sequencing. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics software v. 21.0.Fifty different genetic variations including 4 novel were identified. Most patients showed a typical rod-cone dystrophy phenotype, with best-corrected visual acuity and central visual field deteriorating linearly with age. At age 29, binocular visual field demonstrated an average preservation of 50 central degrees, constricting by 50% within 5 years. Structural changes based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography, short wavelength autofluorescence, and near-infrared autofluorescence measurements did not however correlate with age. Our study revealed a higher percentage of epiretinal membranes and cystoid macular edema in patients with MYO7A mutations compared with rod-cone dystrophy patients with other mutations. Subgroup analyses did not reveal substantial genotype-phenotype correlations.To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest French cohort of patients with MYO7A mutations reported to date. Functional visual characteristics of this subset of patients followed a linear decline as in other typical rod-cone dystrophy, but structural changes were variable indicating the need for a case-by-case evaluation for prognostic prediction and choice of potential therapies."	"Lgr5+ cochlear supporting cells (SCs) have been reported to be hair cell (HC) progenitor cells that have the ability to regenerate HCs in the neonatal mouse cochlea, and these cells are regulated by Wnt signaling. Frizzled-9 (Fzd9), one of the Wnt receptors, has been reported to be used to mark neuronal stem cells in the brain together with other markers and mesenchymal stem cells from human placenta and bone marrow. Here we used Fzd9-CreER mice to lineage label and trace Fzd9+ cells in the postnatal cochlea in order to investigate the progenitor characteristic of Fzd9+ cells. Lineage labeling showed that inner phalangeal cells (IPhCs), inner border cells (IBCs), and third-row Deiters' cells (DCs) were Fzd9+ cells, but not inner pillar cells (IPCs) or greater epithelial ridge (GER) cells at postnatal day (P)3, which suggests that Fzd9+ cells are a much smaller cell population than Lgr5+ progenitors. The expression of Fzd9 progressively decreased and was too low to allow lineage tracing after P14. Lineage tracing for 6 days <i>in vivo</i> showed that Fzd9+ cells could also generate similar numbers of new HCs compared to Lgr5+ progenitors. A sphere-forming assay showed that Fzd9+ cells could form spheres after sorting by flow cytometry, and when we compared the isolated Fzd9+ cells and Lgr5+ progenitors there were no significant differences in sphere number or sphere diameter. In a differentiation assay, the same number of Fzd9+ cells could produce similar amounts of Myo7a+ cells compared to Lgr5+ progenitors after 10 days of differentiation. All these data suggest that the Fzd9+ cells have a similar capacity for proliferation, differentiation, and HC generation as Lgr5+ progenitors and that Fzd9 can be used as a more restricted marker of HC progenitors."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of rare genetically heterogeneous disorders. The present study aimed to identify the genetic cause of a Chinese Han family with non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism (OCA).Here, we report an 11-month-old male proband from a Chinese Han non-consanguineous family, who presented with milky skin, yellow white hair, nystagmus, astigmatism, and hypermetropia. We performed the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the proband and identified two novel compound heterozygous variants (c.1865 T &gt; C (p.Leu622Pro) and exons 17-21 deletion) in OCA2 gene associated with OCA type 2 (OCA2, OMIM 203200). Meanwhile, a previously reported heterozygous mutation (c.4805G &gt; A) in MYO7 gene related with Usher syndrome type 1B was found. The online tools SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and Mutation Taster predicted variant c.1865 T &gt; C was probably damaging. The residue p.Leu622 was in a highly conserved region among species by CLUSTALW. Three-dimensional homology model with I-TASSER indicated that p.Leu622Pro variant disturbed the formation of the α-helix, resulting in a random coil structure. The gross deletion (exons 17-21) in OCA2 gene has was not been reported previously. These two novel variants in OCA2 gene were inherited from each parent respectively, after verification by Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the family.This study indicates the two novel compound heterozygous mutations in OCA2 gene may be responsible for clinical manifestations of OCA2. It expands the mutation spectrum of OCA2 gene and is helpful to screen for large deletions with targeted NGS protocol in monogenic disease. It also assists the genetic counselling, carrier screening and personalized healthcare of the disease."	"To describe retinal alterations detected by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) in paediatric patients with Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1) and to compare these findings to previously published reports.Thirty-two eyes from 16 patients (11 males and 5 females) with a genetic diagnosis of USH1 because of MYO7A mutations underwent SS-OCT. Patients ranged in age from 4 to 17 years (mean, 11,13 ± 4,29). The subfoveal and macular area were analysed with SS-OCT at 1050 nm using 12 radial scans of 12.0 mm. Structural abnormalities were evaluated and correlated with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).The most common qualitative retinal abnormality was external layer damage in macular area. Specific alterations included external limiting membrane loss/disruption (27 eyes; 84.4%), disruption of the Myoid zone (27 eyes; 84.4%); Ellipsoid zone disruption (28 eyes; 87.5%), and loss of the outer segments (29 eyes; 90.6%). The damage of the retinal pigment epithelium was divided according to the loss of the different layers: phagosome zone (30 eyes; 93.8%), melanosome zone (29 eyes; 90.6%) and mitochondria zone (0 eyes; 0%). The presence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) was significantly correlated with alterations in photoreceptors. Disruption or absence of the myoid and ellipsoid zones of the photoreceptors were the only variables independently associated with decreased BCVA.The findings of this study suggest that the physiopathologic basis of early-stage Usher syndrome (USH) may be changes in the outer retinal layer, particularly the photoreceptors, which in turn may cause alterations-such as CMO-in the inner retinal layers. Accordingly, monitoring the condition of photoreceptors during follow-up may be advisable for the early detection of pathologic changes."

In conclusion, we found a set of genes that might regulate the differentiation and maturation of new HCs, and these genes might serve as potential new therapeutic targets for functional HC regeneration and hearing recovery."	"The transcription factor Six1 is essential for induction of sensory cell fate and formation of auditory sensory epithelium, but how it activates gene expression programs to generate distinct cell-types remains unknown. Here, we perform genome-wide characterization of Six1 binding at different stages of auditory sensory epithelium development and find that Six1-binding to cis-regulatory elements changes dramatically at cell-state transitions. Intriguingly, Six1 pre-occupies enhancers of cell-type-specific regulators and effectors before their expression. We demonstrate in-vivo cell-type-specific activity of Six1-bound novel enhancers of Pbx1, Fgf8, Dusp6, Vangl2, the hair-cell master regulator Atoh1 and a cascade of Atoh1's downstream factors, including Pou4f3 and Gfi1. A subset of Six1-bound sites carry consensus-sequences for its downstream factors, including Atoh1, Gfi1, Pou4f3, Gata3 and Pbx1, all of which physically interact with Six1. Motif analysis identifies RFX/X-box as one of the most significantly enriched motifs in Six1-bound sites, and we demonstrate that Six1-RFX proteins cooperatively regulate gene expression through binding to SIX:RFX-motifs. Six1 targets a wide range of hair-bundle regulators and late Six1 deletion disrupts hair-bundle polarity. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how Six1 cooperates with distinct cofactors in feedforward loops to control lineage-specific gene expression programs during progressive differentiation of the auditory sensory epithelium."	"Pou4f3 plays an important role in the development of hair cells in the inner ear sensory epithelia. Autophagy is related to the auditory damage. However, the role and mechanism of Pou4f3 on drug-induced ototoxicity are incompletely understood. Hence, this study aimed to explore the effects of Pou4f3 on the apoptosis of cochlear hair cells (CHCs) and to explore whether autophagy was involved in this process. The cisplatin was used to produce a loss of CHCs to create a murine model of deafness. The AAV vectors were delivered into the scala media through the lateral wall. Compared with the control mice, the cisplatin-treated mice exhibited significantly enhanced apoptosis and autophagy in the cochleae, accompanied by a notably decreased Pou4f3 levels. Both mutation and knockdown of Pou4f3 promoted the apoptosis- and autophagy-related protein levels, and enhanced the cisplatin-induced levels of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins. Furthermore, the autophagy activator rapamycin promoted the apoptosis and autophagy in the cochlea. In addition, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA overturned the promoting effect of Pou4f3 knockdown on the apoptosis and autophagy. Collectively, in cisplatin-induced deafness mice, the Pou4f3 gene mutation facilitated apoptosis of cochlear hair cells, at least partially, through inducing autophagy."	"Recently, there has been increased studies in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We aimed to make an overview of research trends and genetic polymorphisms for NIHL from 2009 to 2018 with VOSviewer software. A total of 2391 papers were identified for research trends analysis in NIHL and 33 studies identified for a brief review of genetic polymorphisms in human NIHL. The number of publications has been increasing over the past decade. The journal Hearing Research published the most articles (218). The USA contributed the largest number of papers (1042; 43.58%), with the most citations (18,987) and the highest H-index (60). The University of Washington was the most contributive institution. Liberman MC published the most articles (32), and Kujawa SG possessed the highest co-citations (584). Except for high-frequency keywords identified by the software, &quot;prevalence,&quot; &quot;oxidative stress,&quot; &quot;hair cells,&quot; and &quot;cochlear implant&quot; were also the latest research frontiers. HSPA1A rs1043618, HSPA1L rs2227956, PON2 rs12026 and rs7785846, SOD2 rs2855116, KCNE1 rs2070358, KCNQ4 rs34287852, GJB2 rs3751385, PCDH15 rs7095441 and rs11004085, GRHL2 rs1981361, ITGA8 rs10508489, MYH14 rs667907, and POU4F3 rs891969 were the research hotspots and were replicated in independent samples. Inflammation response underlying NIHL has emerged and should be considered as a pioneering field in the future for the prevention of NIHL and conservation of hearing."	"To conduct a meta-analysis of performance of DNA methylation in women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+).Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies of methylation markers versus histological endpoints. Pooled sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for CIN2+ were derived from bivariate models. Relative sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+ compared to cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping were pooled using random-effects models.Sixteen thousand three hundred thirty-six women in 43 studies provided data on human genes (CADM1, MAL, MIR-124-2, FAM19A4, POU4F3, EPB41L3, PAX1, SOX1) and HPV16 (L1/L2). Most (81%) studies evaluated methylation assays following a high-risk (HR)-HPV-positive or abnormal cytology result. Pooled CIN2+ and CIN3+ prevalence was 36.7% and 21.5%. For a set specificity of 70%, methylation sensitivity for CIN2+ and CIN3+ were 68.6% (95% CI: 62.9-73.8) and 71.1% (95% CI: 65.7-76.0) and PPV were 53.4% (95% CI: 44.4-62.1) and 35.0% (95% CI: 28.9-41.6). Among HR-HPV+ women, the relative sensitivity of methylation for CIN2+ was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.63-1.04) and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.05-1.42) compared to cytology of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, or greater (ASCUS+) and HPV16/18 genotyping, respectively, while relative specificity was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.99-1.59) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.94-1.13), respectively.DNA methylation is significantly higher in CIN2+ and CIN3+ compared to ≤CIN1. As triage test, DNA methylation has higher specificity than cytology ASCUS+ and higher sensitivity than HPV16/18 genotyping."	"Hearing loss is often due to the absence or the degeneration of hair cells in the cochlea. Understanding the mechanisms regulating the generation of hair cells may therefore lead to better treatments for hearing disorders. To elucidate the transcriptional control mechanisms specifying the progenitor cells (i.e. prosensory cells) that generate the hair cells and support cells critical for hearing function, we compared chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq in sorted prosensory cells (Sox2-EGFP<sup>+</sup>) and surrounding cells (Sox2-EGFP<sup>-</sup>) from E12, E14.5 and E16 cochlear ducts. In Sox2-EGFP<sup>+</sup>, we find greater accessibility in and near genes restricted in expression to the prosensory region of the cochlear duct including Sox2, Isl1, Eya1 and Pou4f3. Furthermore, we find significant enrichment for the consensus binding sites of Sox2, Six1 and Gata3-transcription factors required for prosensory development-in the open chromatin regions. Over 2,200 regions displayed differential accessibility with developmental time in Sox2-EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, with most changes in the E12-14.5 window. Open chromatin regions detected in Sox2-EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells map to over 48,000 orthologous regions in the human genome that include regions in genes linked to deafness. Our results reveal a dynamic landscape of open chromatin in prosensory cells with potential implications for cochlear development and disease."	"Regeneration of mature mammalian inner ear hair cells remains to be a challenge. This study aims to evaluate the ability of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-aza) to generate outer hair cells (OHCs) in a chemically-deafened adult mouse model. 5-aza was administrated into the mouse inner ear via the round window. Immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression of hair cell specific proteins following 5-aza treatment. The results showed that in the chemically-deafened mouse cochlea, new OHCs were found post 5-aza treatment, whereas OHCs were completely lost in saline-treated mice. New hair cells expressed multiple hair cell markers included Myosin VIIa, Pou4f3 and Myosin VI. Newly-generated hair cells presented in three cochlear turns and were able to survive for at least six weeks. The effects of new hair cells generation by 5-aza were concentration dependent. Quantitative PCR study indicates that 5-aza may function through Dnmt1 inhibition. The results of this report suggest that the Dnmt inhibitor 5-aza may promote hair cell regeneration in a chemically-deafened mouse model."	"Damage or loss of auditory hair cells leads to irreversible sensorineural hearing loss in human, thus regeneration of these cells to reconstruct auditory sensory epithelium holds the promise for the treatment of deafness. Regulatory factors involved in the development of auditory sensory epithelium play crucial roles in hair cell regeneration and hearing restoration. Here, we first focus on the transcription factor Atoh1 which is critical for hair cell development and regeneration, and comprehensively summarize the current understanding of the protein structure, target binding motif, developmental expression pattern, functional role, and upstream and downstream regulatory mechanism of Atoh1 in the context of controlling the cell fate commitment to hair cells or transdifferentiation from supporting cells. We also discuss cellular context dependency of Atoh1 in hair cell induction which should be taken into consideration when using Atoh1 gene therapy for hair cell regeneration. Next, we review the roles of Gfi1, Pou4f3, and Barhl1 in hair cell maturation and maintenance, and suggest that manipulation of these genes and their downstream targets will be helpful for the generation of functional hair cells with long-term viability. Finally, we provide an overview of the interplay between Notch, Wnt, Shh, and FGF signaling pathways during auditory sensory epithelium development. By analyzing crosstalk between these pathways, we suggest that combination of Wnt signaling activation with Hey1 and Hey2 inhibition will be crucial for hair cell regeneration and hearing restoration. Furthermore, this review highlights the importance of deeper understanding of the cellular context for hair cell development and the interconnection between these key regulators in developing new strategies to treat sensorineural hearing loss."	"Hearing loss is considered the most common sensory disorder across the world. Nowadays, a cochlear implant can be an effective treatment for patients. Moreover, it is often believed that sensorineural hearing loss in humans is caused by loss or disruption of the function of hair cells in the cochlea. In this respect, mesenchymal cells can be a good candidate for cell-based therapeutic approaches. To this end, the potential of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into hair cells with the help of transfection of microRNA in vitro was investigated. MicroRNA mimics (miRNA-96, 182, and 183) were transfected to human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells using Lipofec-tamine as a common transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions at 50 nM for microRNA mimics and 50 nM for the scramble. The changes in cell morphology were also observed under an inverted microscope. Then, the relative expression levels of SOX2, POU4F3, MYO7A, and calretinin were assayed using real-time polymerase chain reaction according to the ΔΔCt method. The ATOH1 level was similarly measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The results showed that increased expression of miRNA-182, but neither miRNA-96 nor miRNA-183, could lead to higher expression levels in some hair cell markers. The morphology of the cells also did not change in this respect, but the evaluation of gene expression at the levels of mRNA could promote the expression of the ATOH1, SOX2, and POU4F3 markers. Furthermore, miRNA-182 could enhance the expression of ATOH1 at the protein level. According to the results of this study, it was concluded that miRNA-182 could serve as a crucial function in hair cell differentiation by the upregulation of SOX2, POU4F3, and ATOH1 to promote a hair cell's fate."	"Hair cells of the inner ear undergo postnatal development that leads to formation of their sensory organelles, synaptic machinery, and in the case of cochlear outer hair cells, their electromotile mechanism. To examine how the proteome changes over development from postnatal days 0 through 7, we isolated pools of 5000 Pou4f3-Gfp positive or negative cells from the cochlea or utricles; these cell pools were analysed by data-dependent and data-independent acquisition (DDA and DIA) mass spectrometry. DDA data were used to generate spectral libraries, which enabled identification and accurate quantitation of specific proteins using the DIA datasets. DIA measurements were extremely sensitive; we were able to detect proteins present at less than one part in 100,000 from only 312 hair cells. The DDA and DIA datasets will be valuable for accurately quantifying proteins in hair cells and non-hair cells over this developmental window."	"Hearing loss is the most common sensorineural disorder, affecting over 5% of the population worldwide. Its most frequent cause is the loss of hair cells (HCs), the mechanosensory receptors of the cochlea. HCs transduce incoming sounds into electrical signals that activate auditory neurons, which in turn send this information to the brain. Although some spontaneous HC regeneration has been observed in neonatal mammals, the very small pool of putative progenitor cells that have been identified in the adult mammalian cochlea is not able to replace the damaged HCs, making any hearing impairment permanent. To date, guided differentiation of human cells to HC-like cells has only been achieved using either embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, use of such cell types suffers from a number of important disadvantages, such as the risk of tumourigenicity if transplanted into the host´s tissue. We have obtained cells expressing hair cell markers from cultures of human fibroblasts by overexpression of GFI1, Pou4f3 and ATOH1 (GPA), three genes that are known to play a critical role in the development of HCs. Immunocytochemical, qPCR and RNAseq analyses demonstrate the expression of genes typically expressed by HCs in the transdifferentiated cells. Our protocol represents a much faster approach than the methods applied to ESCs and iPSCs and validates the combination of GPA as a set of genes whose activation leads to the direct conversion of human somatic cells towards the hair cell lineage. Our observations are expected to contribute to the development of future therapies aimed at the regeneration of the auditory organ and the restoration of hearing."	"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP-38) is a common neuropeptide exerting a wide spectrum of functions in many fields, including immunology. In the present study, 5-day post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae of three diverse genetic lines [transgenic lines Tg(MPX:GFP) with GFP-labelled neutrophils and Tg(pou4f3:GAP-GFP) with GFP-labelled hair cells and the wild-type Tuebingen] were used to investigate an inhibitory role of PACAP-38 in inflammation associated with damaged hair cells of the lateral line. Individuals of each genetic line were assigned to four groups: (1) control, and those consisting of larvae exposed to (2) 10 µM CuSO4, (3) 10 µM CuSO4+100 nM PACAP-38 and (4) 100 nM PACAP-38, respectively. Forty-minute exposure to CuSO4 solution was applied to evoke necrosis of hair cells and consequent inflammation. The inhibitory role of PACAP-38 was investigated in vivo under a confocal microscope by counting neutrophils migrating towards damaged hair cells in Tg(MPX:GFP) larvae. In CuSO4-treated individuals, the number of neutrophils associated with hair cells was dramatically increased, while PACAP-38 co-treatment resulted in its over 2-fold decrease. However, co-treatment with PACAP-38 did not prevent hair cells from extensive necrosis, which was found in Tg(pou4f3:GAP-GFP) individuals. Real-Time PCR analysis performed in wild-type larvae demonstrated differential expression pattern of stress and inflammation inducible markers. The most significant findings showed that CuSO4 exposure up-regulated the expression of IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6 and ATF3, while after PACAP-38 co-treatment expression levels of these genes were significantly decreased. The presence of transcripts for all PACAP receptors in neutrophils was also revealed. Adcyap1r1a and vipr1b appeared to be predominant forms. The present results suggest that PACAP-38 should be considered as a factor playing an important regulatory role in inflammatory response associated with pathological processes affecting zebrafish hair cells and it cannot be excluded that this interesting property has more universal significance."	"Hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss is extremely heterogeneous. Mutations in the POU class 4 transcription factor 3 <i>(POU4F3)</i> are known to cause autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss linked to the loci of DFNA15. In this study, we describe a pathogenic missense mutation in <i>POU4F3</i> in a four-generation Chinese family (6126) with midfrequency, progressive, and postlingual autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). By combining targeted capture of 129 known deafness genes, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, we identified <i>POU4F3</i> c.602T&gt;C (p.Leu201Pro) as the disease-causing variant. This variant cosegregated with hearing loss in other family members but was not detected in 580 normal controls or the ExAC database and could be classified as a &quot;pathogenic variant&quot; according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. We conclude that <i>POU4F3</i> c.602T&gt;C (p.Leu201Pro) is related to midfrequency hearing loss in this family. Routine examination of <i>POU4F3</i> is necessary for the genetic diagnosis of midfrequency hearing loss."	"The vertebrate lateral line system comprises a mechanosensory division, with neuromasts containing hair cells that detect local water movement (&quot;distant touch&quot;); and an electrosensory division, with electrosensory organs that detect the weak, low-frequency electric fields surrounding other animals in water (primarily used for hunting). The entire lateral line system was lost in the amniote lineage with the transition to fully terrestrial life; the electrosensory division was lost independently in several lineages, including the ancestors of frogs and of teleost fishes. (Electroreception with different characteristics subsequently evolved independently within two teleost lineages.) Recent gene expression studies in a non-teleost actinopterygian fish suggest that electroreceptor ribbon synapses employ the same transmission mechanisms as hair cell ribbon synapses, and show that developing electrosensory organs express transcription factors essential for hair cell development, including Atoh1 and Pou4f3. Previous hypotheses for electroreceptor evolution suggest either that electroreceptors and hair cells evolved independently in the vertebrate ancestor from a common ciliated secondary cell, or that electroreceptors evolved from hair cells. The close developmental and putative physiological similarities implied by the gene expression data support the latter hypothesis, i.e., that electroreceptors evolved in the vertebrate ancestor as a &quot;sister cell-type&quot; to lateral line hair cells."	"Although hair cells are the sensory receptors of the auditory and vestibular systems in the ears of all vertebrates, hair cell properties are different between non-mammalian vertebrates and mammals. To understand the basic biological properties of hair cells from non-mammalian vertebrates, we examined the transcriptome of adult zebrafish auditory and vestibular hair cells. GFP-labeled hair cells were isolated from inner-ear sensory epithelia of a pou4f3 promoter-driven GAP-GFP line of transgenic zebrafish. One thousand hair cells and 1,000 non-sensory surrounding cells (nsSCs) were separately collected for each biological replicate, using the suction pipette technique. RNA sequencing of three biological replicates for the two cell types was performed and analyzed. Comparisons between hair cells and nsSCs allow identification of enriched genes in hair cells, which may underlie hair cell specialization. Our dataset provides an extensive resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying morphology, function, and pathology of adult zebrafish hair cells. It also establishes a framework for future characterization of genes expressed in hair cells and the study of hair cell evolution."	"In this study, we attempted to differentiated human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to auditory hair cells using growth factors.Retinoic acid (RA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were added to hBMSCs cell culture medium. The cells were evaluated morphologically and the expression of SOX2, POU4F3, MYO7A, and Calretinin at mRNA level and ATOH1 mRNA and protein expression.After treatment with the growth factors, the morphology of the cells did not change, but evaluation of gene expression at the mRNA level increased the expression of the ATOH1, SOX2, and POU4F3 markers. Growth factors increased the expression of ATOH1 at the protein level. The expression of calretinin showed decreased and MYO7A no significant change in expression.hBMSCs have the potential to differentiate to hair cell-like using the RA, bFGF, and EGF."	"A photoreceptor cell line, 661W, derived from a mouse retinal tumor that expresses several markers of cone photoreceptor cells has been described earlier. However, these cells can be differentiated into neuronal cells. Here, we report that this cell line expressed certain markers specific to retinal ganglion cells such as Rbpms, Brn3b (Pou4f2), Brn3c (Pou4f3), Thy1 and γ-synuclein (Sncg), and some other markers of neuronal cells (beta-III tubulin, NeuN and MAP2). These cells also expressed Opn1mw, a cone-specific marker and nestin, a marker for neural precursor cells. Two glaucoma-associated mutants of OPTN, E50K and M98K, but not an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated mutant, E478G, induced cell death selectively in 661W cells. However, in a motor neuron cell line, NSC34, E478G mutant of OPTN but not E50K and M98K induced cell death. We conclude that 661W is a retinal ganglion precursor-like cell line, which shows properties of both retinal ganglion and photoreceptor cells. We suggest that these cells could be utilized for exploring the mechanisms of cell death induction and cytoprotection relevant for glaucoma pathogenesis. RGC-5 cell line which probably arose from 661W cells showed expression of essentially the same markers of retinal ganglion cells and neuronal cells as seen in 661W cells."	"We hypothesized that DNA methylation of development-related genes may occur in endometrial cancer (EC)/ovarian cancer (OC) and may be detected in cervical scrapings.We tested methylation status by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for 14 genes in DNA pools of endometrial and OC tissues. Tissues of EC/normal endometrium, OC/normal ovary, were verified in training set using cervical scrapings of 10 EC/10 OC patients and 10 controls, and further validated in the testing set using independent cervical scrapings in 30 EC/30 OC patients and 30 controls. We generated cutoff values of methylation index (M-index) from cervical scrapings to distinguish between cancer patients and control. Sensitivity/specificity of DNA methylation biomarkers in detecting EC and OC was calculated.Of 14 genes, 4 (PTGDR, HS3ST2, POU4F3, MAGI2) showed hypermethylation in EC and OC tissues, and were verified in training set. POU4F3 and MAGI2 exhibited hypermethylation in training set were validated in independent cases. The mean M-index of POU4F3 is 78.28 in EC and 20.36 in OC, which are higher than that in controls (6.59; p&lt;0.001 and p=0.100, respectively), and that of MAGI2 is 246.0 in EC and 12.2 in OC, which is significantly higher that than in controls (2.85; p&lt;0.001 and p=0.480, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity of POU4F3/MAGI2 were 83%-90% and 69%-75% for detection of EC, and 61% and 62%-69% for the detection of OC.The findings demonstrate the potential of EC/OC detection through testing for DNA methylation in cervical scrapings."	"Autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) is genetically heterogeneous with more than 35 genes identified to date. Using a massively parallel sequencing panel targeting 159 deafness genes, we identified a novel missense variant of POU4F3 (c.982A&gt;G, p.Lys328Glu) which co-segregated with the deafness phenotype in a three-generation Taiwanese family with ADNSHL. This variant could be classified as a &quot;pathogenic variant&quot; according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. We then performed subcellular localization experiments and confirmed that p.Lys328Glu compromised transportation of POU4F3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. POU3F4 p.Lys328Glu was located within a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), and was the first missense variant in bipartite NLS of POU4F3 validated in functional studies. These findings expanded the mutation spectrum of POU4F3 and provided insight into the pathogenesis associated with aberrant POU4F3 localization."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."
"SLC17A8"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Postnatal mammalian cochlear hair cells (HCs) can be regenerated by direct transdifferentiation or by mitotic regeneration from supporting cells through many pathways, including Atoh1, Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch signaling. However, most new HCs are immature HCs. In this study we used RNA-Seq analysis to compare the differences between the transcriptomes of <i>Atoh1</i> overexpression-induced new HCs and the native HCs, and to define the factors that might help to promote the maturation of new HCs. As expected, we found <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had obvious HC characteristics as demonstrated by the expression of HC markers such as <i>Pou4f3</i> and Myosin VIIA (Myo7a). However, <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had significantly lower expression of genes that are related to HC function such as Slc26a5 (<i>Prestin</i>), <i>Slc17a8</i> and <i>Otof</i>. We found that genes related to HC cell differentiation and maturation (<i>Kcnma1</i>, <i>Myo6</i>, <i>Myo7a</i>, <i>Grxcr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Wnt5a</i>, <i>Fgfr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Fgf8</i> etc.) had significantly lower expression levels in new HCs compared to native HCs. In conclusion, we found a set of genes that might regulate the differentiation and maturation of new HCs, and these genes might serve as potential new therapeutic targets for functional HC regeneration and hearing recovery."	"To examine whether exposure to sodium salicylate disrupts expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) and whether the alteration in expression corresponds to increased risk for tinnitus. Rats were treated with saline (control) or sodium salicylate (treated) Rats were examined for tinnitus by monitoring gap-pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (GPIAS). Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was applied to evaluate hearing function after treatment. Rats were sacrificed after injection to obtain the cochlea, cochlear nucleus (CN), and inferior colliculus (IC) for examination of VGLUT3 expression. No significant differences in hearing thresholds between groups were identified (p&gt;0.05). Tinnitus in sodium salicylate-treated rats was confirmed by GPIAS. VGLUT3 encoded by solute carrier family 17 members 8 (SLC17a8) expression was significantly increased in inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea in treated animals, compared with controls (p&lt;0.01). No significant differences in VGLUT3 expression between groups were found for the cochlear nucleus (CN) or IC (p&gt;0.05). Exposure to sodium salicylate may disrupt SLC17a8 expression in IHCs, leading to alterations that correspond to tinnitus in rats. However, the CN and IC are unaffected by exposure to sodium salicylate, suggesting that enhancement of VGLUT3 expression in IHCs may contribute to the pathogenesis of tinnitus."	"The Mexican American population is among the fastest growing aging population and has a younger onset of cognitive decline. This group is also heavily burdened with metabolic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Unfortunately, limited research has been conducted in this group. Understanding methylation alterations, which are influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors, is key to identifying and addressing the root cause for mild cognitive impairment, a clinical precursor for dementia. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on a community-based Mexican American population using the Illumina EPIC array. Following rigorous quality control measures, we identified 10 CpG sites to be differentially methylated between normal controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment annotated to PKIB, KLHL29, SEPT9, OR2C3, CPLX3, BCL2L2-PABPN1, and CCNY. We found four regions to be differentially methylated in TMEM232, SLC17A8, ALOX12, and SEPT8. Functional gene-set analysis identified four gene-sets, RIN3, SPEG, CTSG, and UBE2L3, as significant. The gene ontology and pathway analyses point to neuronal cell death, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammatory processes. We found 1,450 processes to be enriched using empirical Bayes gene-set enrichment. In conclusion, the functional overlap of differentially methylated genes associated with cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans implies cross-talk between metabolically-instigated systemic inflammation and disruption of synaptic vesicular transport."	"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) represents a group of inherited retinopathies with early-onset nyctalopia followed by progressive photoreceptor degeneration causing irreversible vision loss. Mutations in USH2A are the most common cause of non-syndromic RP. Here, we reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a RP patient with a mutation in <i>USH2A</i> (c.8559-2A &gt; G/c.9127_9129delTCC). Then, multilayer retinal organoids including neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were generated by three-step &quot;induction-reversal culture.&quot; The early retinal organoids derived from the RP patient with the USH2A mutation exhibited significant defects in terms of morphology, immunofluorescence staining and transcriptional profiling. To the best of our knowledge, the pathogenic mutation (c.9127_9129delTCC) in <i>USH2A</i> has not been reported previously among RP patients. Notably, the expression of laminin in the USH2A mutation organoids was significantly lower than in the iPSCs derived from healthy, age- and sex-matched controls during the retinal organogenesis. We also observed that abnormal retinal neuroepithelium differentiation and polarization caused defective retinal progenitor cell development and retinal layer formation, disordered organization of NRs in the presence of the USH2A mutation. Furthermore, the USH2A mutation bearing RPE cells presented abnormal morphology, lacking pigmented foci and showing an apoptotic trend and reduced expression of specific makers, such as MITF, <i>PEDF</i>, and RPE65. In addition, the USH2A mutation organoids had lower expression of cilium-associated (especially <i>CFAP43</i>, <i>PIFO</i>) and dopaminergic synapse-related genes (including <i>DLGAP1</i>, <i>GRIK1</i>, <i>SLC17A7</i>, and <i>SLC17A8</i>), while there was higher expression of neuron apoptotic process-related genes (especially <i>HIF1A</i>, <i>ADARB1</i>, and <i>CASP3</i>). This study may provide essential assistance in the molecular diagnosis and screening of RP. This work recapitulates the pathogenesis of USH2A using patient-specific organoids and demonstrated that alterations in USH2A function due to mutations may lead to cellular and molecular abnormalities."	"Zebrafish lateral line neuromasts are composed of central hair cells surrounded by supporting cells. Cisplatin is a common anticancer drug, with hair cell disruption being a frequent side effect of this drug. In our study, we observed complete functional hair cell loss after six hours of cisplatin insult in neuromasts, as demonstrated by anti-parvalbumin 3 immunofluorescence staining or YO-PRO1 vital dye staining. Time course analysis of neuromast hair cell regeneration showed that regenerated hair cells first appeared between 12 and 24h after damage, and the abundance of these cells increased stepwise with recovery time. After 72h, 90% of the hair cells were regenerated, and after 84h, the number of regenerated hair cells was comparable to the number of neuromast hair cells before treatment. The expression pattern of slc17a8 also showed that hair cells were regenerated after cisplatin exposure. Meanwhile, peripheral supporting cells moved toward the center of the neuromasts, as shown by the in situ expression pattern of sox21a. Increased hair cell progenitor formation was also observed, as demonstrated by the in situ expression pattern of atoh1a. Furthermore, we detected increased expression of wnt2, wnt3a, and ctnnb1 in sorted supporting cells from the sqet10 transgenic line, which labels neuromast supporting cells specifically. In situ hybridization analysis also showed decreased expression of dkk1a and dkk2. Regenerated hair cells were inhibited by early inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Taken together, the results presented here showed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated in supporting cells during cisplatin exposure earlier than expected. Our results also indicated that supporting cells enabled hair cell regeneration via Wnt/β-catenin signaling during cisplatin exposure."	"<b>Objective:</b>To summarize the clinic procedure and experience about gene diagnosis and genetic counseling on hereditary hearing loss, and explore the strategy and principle about gene diagnosis and genetic counseling on hereditary hearing loss.<b>Method:</b>A retrospective analysis was used on the clinical data of 151 cases who aim at genetic counseling. The all cases were divided into 5 groups according to the purpose of genetic counseling, such as the occurrence risk of hearing loss, the etiological analysis, the choice of the intervention way, the examination guidance, the prevention of hearing loss and the usage requirement of Aminogly cosides drugs. The counseling procedure includes the investigation of the etiology and family history, drawing the family pedigree, general physical examination, auditory examination and genetic analysis. Sanger sequencing analysis and/or Targeted nextgeneration sequencing was utilized to detect the deaf-gene mutations. At last, the genetic counseling, fertility guidance and prenatal diagnosis will be made on the basis of the results of gene detection. <b>Result:</b>There are 33 newborns who did not pass the deafgene screening, 9 of them could be diagnosed definitely as hereditary hearing loss, and the other 24 were the carriers of deafgene mutation. Eighty of 104 deaf patients were diagnosed definitely as hereditary hearing loss and the related gene mutation was found. Six objects in the 10 patients with auditory neuropathy are diagnosed as OTOF or SLC17A8 gene mutations before cochlear implantation. Three of 7 reproductive age objects who had family history were recessive deaf-gene carriers, 2 of them carried the same target gene with the mate who receive our fertility guidance and prenatal diagnose. The other 1 object carried the dominant genetic mutation(incomplete dominant heredity). There were 4 pregnant women who did not pass the deaf-gene screening, 1 of them carry the same target gene with the mate. The populations who want to use Aminoglycosides drugs were not diagnosed as carrying any related mitochondrial gene mutation. We carried out the genetic counseling according to the results of gens detection and clinical phenotype.<b>Conclusion:</b>Genetic counseling is based on the different purpose. The analysis of gene diagnosis should be considered to combine with the clinical phenotype. The principle of choosing the objects to make a gene diagnosis includes: ①the all deaf-genes sequencing was applied for the deaf patients. ② the screening target gene sequencing was used for the newborns who did not pass the deaf-gene screening and the mate whose pregnant wife did not pass the deafgene screening. ③the specific target gene sequencing could be used for the patients who has a clear family history or specific phenotype."	"The atypical vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 is present in subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons in the cortex and the hippocampus, in subgroups of serotoninergic neurons in raphe nuclei, and in cholinergic interneurons in the striatum. C56BL/6N mice that no longer express VGLUT3 (VGLUT3<sup>-/-</sup> ) display anxiety-associated phenotype, increased spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotor activity and decreased haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Inbred mouse strains differ markedly in their sensitivity to anxiety and behavioral responses elicited by drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate strain differences in VGLUT3 expression levels and its potential correlates with anxiety and reward-guided behaviors. Five inbred mouse lines were chosen according to their contrasted anxiety and drugs sensitivity: C57BL/6N, C3H/HeN, DBA/2J, 129/Sv, and BALB/c. VGLUT3 protein expression was measured in different brain areas involved in reward or mood regulation (such as the striatum, the hippocampus, and raphe nuclei) and genetic variations in Slc17a8, the gene encoding for VGLUT3, have been explored. These five inbred mouse strains express very different levels of VGLUT3, which cannot be attributed to the genetic variation of the Slc17a8 locus. Furthermore, mice behavior in the open field, elevated plus maze, spontaneous- and cocaine-induced locomotor was highly heterogeneous and only partially correlated to VGLUT3 levels. These data highlight the fact that one single gene polymorphism could not account for VGLUT3 expression variations, and that region specific VGLUT3 expression level variations might play a key role in the modulation of discrete behaviors."	"<i>In vivo</i> genetic mutation has become a powerful tool for dissecting gene function; however, multi-gene interaction and the compensatory mechanisms involved can make findings from single mutations, at best difficult to interpret, and, at worst, misleading. Hence, it is necessary to establish an efficient way to disrupt multiple genes simultaneously. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base editing disrupts gene function by converting a protein-coding sequence into a stop codon; this is referred to as CRISPR-stop. Its application in generating zygotic mutations has not been well explored yet. Here, we first performed a proof-of-principle test by disrupting <i>Atoh1</i>, a gene crucial for auditory hair cell generation. Next, we individually mutated <i>vGlut3</i> (<i>Slc17a8</i>), otoferlin (<i>Otof</i>) and prestin (<i>Slc26a5</i>), three genes needed for normal hearing function. Finally, we successfully disrupted <i>vGlut3</i>, <i>Otof</i> and prestin simultaneously. Our results show that CRISPR-stop can efficiently generate single or triple homozygous F0 mouse mutants, bypassing laborious mouse breeding. We believe that CRISPR-stop is a powerful method that will pave the way for high-throughput screening of mouse developmental and functional genes, matching the efficiency of methods available for model organisms such as <i>Drosophila.</i>"	"Precise mouse genetic studies rely on specific tools that can label specific cell types. In mouse cochlea, previous studies suggest that vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (vGlut3), also known as Slc17a8, is specifically expressed in inner hair cells (IHCs) and loss of vGlut3 causes deafness. To take advantage of its unique expression pattern, here we generate a novel vGlut3-P2A-iCreER knockin mouse strain. The P2A-iCreER cassette is precisely inserted before stop codon of vGlut3, by which the endogenous vGlut3 is intact and paired with iCreER as well. Approximately, 10.7%, 85.6% and 41.8% of IHCs are tdtomato + when tamoxifen is given to vGlut3-P2A-iCreER/+; Rosa26-LSL-tdtomato/+ reporter strain at P2/P3, P10/P11 and P30/P31, respectively. Tdtomato + OHCs are never observed. Interestingly, besides IHCs, glia cells, but not spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), are tdtomato+, which is further evidenced by the presence of Sox10+/tdtomato+ and tdtomato+/Prox1(Gata3 or Tuj1)-negative cells in SGN region. We further independently validate vGlut3 expression in SGN region by vGlut3 in situ hybridization and antibody staining. Moreover, total number of tdtomato + glia cells decreased gradually when tamoxifen is given from P2/P3 to P30/P31. Taken together, vGlut3-P2A-iCreER is an efficient genetic tool to specifically target IHCs for gene manipulation, which is complimentary to Prestin-CreER strain exclusively labelling cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs)."	"Incretins (GLP-1 and GIP) potentiate insulin secretion through cAMP signaling in pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-dependent manner. We recently proposed a mechanistic model of incretin-induced insulin secretion (IIIS) that requires two critical processes: 1) generation of cytosolic glutamate through the malate-aspartate (MA) shuttle in glucose metabolism and 2) glutamate transport into insulin granules by cAMP signaling to promote insulin granule exocytosis. To directly prove the model, we have established and characterized CRISPR/Cas9-engineered clonal mouse β-cell lines deficient for the genes critical in these two processes: aspartate aminotransferase 1 (AST1, gene symbol Got1), a key enzyme in the MA shuttle, which generates cytosolic glutamate, and the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and VGLUT3, gene symbol Slc17a7, Slc17a6, and Slc17a8, respectively), which participate in glutamate transport into secretory vesicles. Got1 knockout (KO) β-cell lines were defective in cytosolic glutamate production from glucose and showed impaired IIIS. Unexpectedly, different from the previous finding that global Slc17a7 KO mice exhibited impaired IIIS from pancreatic islets, β-cell specific Slc17a7 KO mice showed no significant impairment in IIIS, as assessed by pancreas perfusion experiment. Single Slc17a7 KO β-cell lines also retained IIIS, probably due to compensatory upregulation of Slc17a6. Interestingly, triple KO of Slc17a7, Slc17a6, and Slc17a8 diminished IIIS, which was rescued by exogenously introduced wild-type Slc17a7 or Slc17a6 genes. The present study provides direct evidence for the essential roles of AST1 and VGLUTs in β-cell glutamate signaling for IIIS and also shows the usefulness of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for studying β-cells by simultaneous disruption of multiple genes."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is a common genetically heterogeneous disorder, which follows Mendelian inheritance in humans. Because of this heterogeneity, the identification of the causative gene of HHL by linkage analysis or Sanger sequencing have shown economic and temporal limitations. With recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, rapid identification of a causative gene via massively parallel sequencing is now possible. We recruited a Korean family with three generations exhibiting autosomal dominant inheritance of hearing loss (HL), and the clinical information about this family revealed that there are no other symptoms accompanied with HL. To identify a causative mutation of HL in this family, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 4 family members, 3 affected and an unaffected. As the result, A novel splicing mutation, c.763+1G&gt;T, in the solute carrier family 17, member 8 (SLC17A8) gene was identified in the patients, and the genotypes of the mutation were co-segregated with the phenotype of HL. Additionally, this mutation was not detected in 100 Koreans with normal hearing. Via NGS, we detected a novel splicing mutation that might influence the hearing ability within the patients with autosomal dominant non-syndromic HL. Our data suggests that this technique is a powerful tool to discover causative genetic factors of HL and facilitate diagnoses of the primary cause of HHL."	"The atypical vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (VGLUT3) is expressed by subpopulations of neurons using acetylcholine, GABA, or serotonin as neurotransmitters. In addition, VGLUT3 is expressed in the inner hair cells of the auditory system. A mutation (p.A211V) in the gene that encodes VGLUT3 is responsible for progressive deafness in two unrelated families. In this study, we investigated the consequences of the p.A211V mutation in cell cultures and in the CNS of a mutant mouse. The mutation substantially decreased VGLUT3 expression (-70%). We measured VGLUT3-p.A211V activity by vesicular uptake in BON cells, electrophysiological recording of isolated neurons, and its ability to stimulate serotonergic accumulation in cortical synaptic vesicles. Despite a marked loss of expression, the activity of the mutated isoform was only minimally altered. Furthermore, mutant mice displayed none of the behavioral alterations that have previously been reported in VGLUT3 knock-out mice. Finally, we used stimulated emission depletion microscopy to analyze how the mutation altered VGLUT3 distribution within the terminals of mice expressing the mutated isoform. The mutation appeared to reduce the expression of the VGLUT3 transporter by simultaneously decreasing the number of VGLUT3-positive synaptic vesicles and the amount of VGLUT3 per synapses. These observations suggested that VGLUT3 global activity is not linearly correlated with VGLUT3 expression. Furthermore, our data unraveled a nonuniform distribution of VGLUT3 in synaptic vesicles. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for this complex vesicular sorting will be critical to understand VGLUT's involvement in normal and pathological conditions.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> VGLUT3 is an atypical member of the vesicular glutamate transporter family. A point mutation of VGLUT3 (VGLUT3-p.A211V) responsible for a progressive loss of hearing has been identified in humans. We observed that this mutation dramatically reduces VGLUT3 expression in terminals (∼70%) without altering its function. Furthermore, using stimulated emission depletion microscopy, we found that reducing the expression levels of VGLUT3 diminished the number of VGLUT3-positive vesicles at synapses. These unexpected findings challenge the vision of a uniform distribution of synaptic vesicles at synapses. Therefore, the overall activity of VGLUT3 is not proportional to the level of VGLUT3 expression. These data will be key in interpreting the role of VGLUTs in human pathologies."	"Mild maternal iron deficiency anemia (IDA) adversely affects the development of cochlear hair cells of the young offspring, but the mechanisms underlying the association are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether mild maternal IDA in guinea pigs could interrupt inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapse density and outer hair cell motility of the offspring. Here, we established a dietary restriction model that allows us to study quantitative changes in the number of IHC ribbon synapses and hearing impairment in response to mild maternal IDA in young guinea pig. The offspring were weaned on postnatal day (PND) 9 and then were given the iron-sufficient diet. On PND 24, pups were examined the hearing function by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements. Then, the cochleae were harvested for assessment of the number of IHC ribbon synapses by immunofluorescence, the morphology of cochlear hair cells, and spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) by scanning electron microscope and hematoxylin-eosin staining, the location, and expression of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 3, myosin VIIa, and prestin by immunofluorescence and blotting. Here, we show that mild maternal IDA in guinea pigs induced elevated ABR threshold shifts, declined DPOAE level shifts, and reduced the number of ribbon synapses, impaired the morphology of cochlear hair cells and SGCs in offsprings. In addition, downregulation of VGLUT3 and myosin VIIa, and upregulation of prestin were observed in the cochlea of offsprings from mild maternal IDA in guinea pigs. These data indicate that mild maternal IDA in guinea pigs induced hearing impairment in offsprings, and this deficit may be attributed to the reduction of ribbon synapse density and dysregulation of VGLUT3, myosin VIIa, and prestin. "	"One of the causes of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is degeneration of the inner hair cells in the organ of Corti in the cochlea. The SLC17A8 (solute carrier family 17, member 8) gene encodes vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3), and among its isoforms (VGLUT1-3), only VGLUT3 is expressed selectively in the inner hair cells (IHCs). VGLUT3 transports the neurotransmitter glutamate into the synaptic vesicles of the IHCs. Mutation of the SLC17A8 gene is reported to be associated with DFNA25 (deafness, autosomal dominant 25), an autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) in humans.In this study, we performed a genetic analysis of 87 unrelated Korean patients with ADNSHL to determine whether the SLC17A8 gene affects hearing ability in the Korean population.We found a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation, 2 non-synonymous variations, and a synonymous variation. The novel frameshift mutation, p.M206Nfs*4, in which methionine is changed to asparagine at amino acid position 206, resulted in a termination codon at amino acid position 209. This alteration is predicted to encode a truncated protein lacking transmembrane domains 5 to 12. This mutation is located in a highly conserved region in VGLUT3 across multiple amino acid alignments in different vertebrate species, but it was not detected in 100 unrelated controls who had normal hearing ability. The results from our study suggest that the p.M206Nfs*4 mutation in the SLC17A8 gene is likely a pathogenic mutation that causes ADNSHL.Our findings can facilitate the prediction of the primary cause of ADNSHL in Korean patients."	"Tonically active cholinergic interneurons (TANs) from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are centrally involved in reward behavior. TANs express a vesicular glutamate transporter referred to as VGLUT3 and thus use both acetylcholine and glutamate as neurotransmitters. The respective roles of each transmitter in the regulation of reward and addiction are still unknown. In this study, we showed that disruption of the gene that encodes VGLUT3 (Slc17a8) markedly increased cocaine self-administration in mice. Concomitantly, the amount of dopamine (DA) release was strongly augmented in the NAc of VGLUT3(-/-) mice because of a lack of signaling by metabotropic glutamate receptors. Furthermore, dendritic spines and glutamatergic synaptic transmission on medium spiny neurons were increased in the NAc of VGLUT3(-/-) mice. Increased DA and glutamate signaling in the NAc are hallmarks of addiction. Our study shows that TANs use glutamate to reduce DA release and decrease reinforcing properties of cocaine in mice. Interestingly, we also observed an increased frequency of rare variations in SLC17A8 in a cohort of severe drug abusers compared with controls. Our findings identify VGLUT3 as an unexpected regulator of drug abuse. "	"Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are responsible for loading glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Altered VGLUT protein expression has been suggested to affect quantal size and glutamate release under both physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we investigated mRNA and protein expression levels of the three VGLUT subtypes in hippocampal tissue of patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), International League Against Epilepsy type 1 (ILAE type 1) compared to autopsy controls, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and semi-quantitative western blotting. mRNA expression levels of the VGLUTs are unaffected in hippocampal epileptic tissue compared to autopsy controls. At the protein level, VGLUT1 expression remains unaltered, while VGLUT2 is significantly decreased and VGLUT3 protein is significantly increased in hippocampal biopsies from TLE patients compared to controls. Our findings at the protein level can be explained by previously described histopathological changes observed in HS. Although VGLUTs have been repeatedly investigated in distinct rodent epilepsy models, their expression levels were hitherto not fully unraveled in the most difficult-to-treat form of epilepsy: TLE with HS ILAE type 1. We here, demonstrate for the first time that VGLUT2 protein expression is significantly decreased and VGLUT3 protein is significantly increased in the hippocampus of patients suffering from TLE with HS ILAE type 1 compared to autopsy controls."	"Inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) are the two types of sensory receptor cells that are critical for hearing in the mammalian cochlea. IHCs and OHCs have different morphology and function. The genetic mechanisms that define their morphological and functional specializations are essentially unknown. The transcriptome reflects the genes that are being actively expressed in a cell and holds the key to understanding the molecular mechanisms of the biological properties of the cell. Using DNA microarray, we examined the transcriptome of 2000 individually collected IHCs and OHCs from adult mouse cochleae. We show that 16,647 and 17,711 transcripts are expressed in IHCs and OHCs, respectively. Of those genes, ∼73% are known genes, 22% are uncharacterized sequences, and 5.0% are noncoding RNAs in both populations. A total of 16,117 transcripts are expressed in both populations. Uniquely and differentially expressed genes account for &lt;15% of all genes in either cell type. The top 10 differentially expressed genes include Slc17a8, Dnajc5b, Slc1a3, Atp2a3, Osbpl6, Slc7a14, Bcl2, Bin1, Prkd1, and Map4k4 in IHCs and Slc26a5, C1ql1, Strc, Dnm3, Plbd1, Lbh, Olfm1, Plce1, Tectb, and Ankrd22 in OHCs. We analyzed commonly and differentially expressed genes with the focus on genes related to hair cell specializations in the apical, basolateral, and synaptic membranes. Eighty-three percent of the known deafness-related genes are expressed in hair cells. We also analyzed genes involved in cell-cycle regulation. Our dataset holds an extraordinary trove of information about the molecular mechanisms underlying hair cell morphology, function, pathology, and cell-cycle control. "	"Tonotopy is one of the most fundamental principles of auditory function. While gradients in various morphological and physiological characteristics of the cochlea have been reported, little information is available on gradient patterns of gene expression. In addition, the audiograms in autosomal dominant non syndromic hearing loss can be distinctive, however, the mechanism that accounts for that has not been clarified. We thought that it is possible that tonotopic gradients of gene expression within the cochlea account for the distinct audiograms.We compared expression profiles of genes in the cochlea between the apical, middle, and basal turns of the mouse cochlea by microarray technology and quantitative RT-PCR. Of 24,547 genes, 783 annotated genes expressed more than 2-fold. The most remarkable finding was a gradient of gene expression changes in four genes (Pou4f3, Slc17a8, Tmc1, and Crym) whose mutations cause autosomal dominant deafness. Expression of these genes was greater in the apex than in the base. Interestingly, expression of the Emilin-2 and Tectb genes, which may have crucial roles in the cochlea, was also greater in the apex than in the base.This study provides baseline data of gradient gene expression in the cochlea. Especially for genes whose mutations cause autosomal dominant non syndromic hearing loss (Pou4f3, Slc17a8, Tmc1, and Crym) as well as genes important for cochlear function (Emilin-2 and Tectb), gradual expression changes may help to explain the various pathological conditions."	"Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) are two major histological subtypes of lung cancer. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have made considerable advances in the understanding of lung cancer susceptibility. Obvious heterogeneity has been observed between different histological subtypes of lung cancer, but genetic determinants in specific to lung SqCC have not been systematically investigated. Here, we performed the GWAS analysis specifically for lung SqCC in 833 SqCC cases and 3,094 controls followed by a two-stage replication in additional 2,223 lung SqCC cases and 6,409 controls from Chinese populations. We found that rs12296850 in SLC17A8-NR1H4 gene region at12q23.1 was significantly associated with risk of lung SqCC at genome-wide significance level [additive model: odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-0.84, P = 1.19×10(-10)]. Subjects carrying AG or GG genotype had a 26% (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.81) or 32% (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.56-0.83) decreased risk of lung SqCC, respectively, as compared with AA genotype. However, we did not observe significant association between rs12296850 and risk of lung AC in a total of 4,368 cases with lung AC and 9,486 controls (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.90-1.02, P = 0.173). These results indicate that genetic variations on chromosome 12q23.1 may specifically contribute to lung SqCC susceptibility in Chinese population."
"TECTA"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Non-synonymous mutations altering tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are widely studied. However, synonymous mutations, which do not alter the protein sequence, are rarely investigated in melanoma genome studies.We explored the role of somatic synonymous mutations in melanoma samples from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). The pathogenic synonymous mutation and neutral synonymous mutation data were used to assess the significance of pathogenic synonymous mutations in melanoma likely to affect genetic regulatory elements using Fisher's exact test. Poisson distribution probabilities of each gene were used to mine the genes with multiple potential functional synonymous mutations affecting regulatory elements.Concentrating on five types of genetic regulatory functions, we found that the mutational patterns of pathogenic synonymous mutations are mostly involved in exonic splicing regulators in near-splicing sites or inside DNase I hypersensitivity sites or non-optimal codon. Moreover, the sites of miRNA binding alteration exhibit a significantly lower rate of evolution than other sites. Finally, 12 genes were hit by recurrent potentially functional synonymous mutations, which showed statistical significance in the pathogenic mutations. Among them, nine genes (DNAH5, ADCY8, GRIN2A, KSR2, TECTA, RIMS2, XKR6, MYH1, SCN10A) have been reported to be mutated in melanoma, and other three genes (SLC9A2, CASR, SLC8A3) have a great potential to impact melanoma.These findings confirm the functional consequences of somatic synonymous mutations in melanoma, emphasizing the significance of research in future studies."	"Changing consumption patterns and increasing health awareness, especially in Europe, are resulting in an increased demand for sesame seeds. In 2016, Asia imported the highest quantity of sesame seeds, followed by Europe and North America. We examined, for the first time, the effects of treatment with sesame oil and sesamin in hearing impairment models. Sesame oil exhibited an ameliorative effect on auditory impairment in a hair cell line in zebrafish and mice. In ototoxic zebrafish larvae, neuromasts and otic cells increased in numbers because of sesame oil. Furthermore, auditory function in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) was studied through auditory brainstem response to evaluate the therapeutic effects of sesame oil. Sesame oil reduced the hearing threshold shift in response to clicks and 8, 16-kHz tone bursts in NIHL mice. Auditory-protective effect of sesame oil was seen in zebrafish and mice; therefore, we used chromatographic analysis to study sesamin, which is the major effective factor in sesame oil. To investigate its effects related to auditory function, we studied the hearing-related gene, <i>Tecta</i>, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Auditory cell proliferation was induced by treatment with sesame oil and sesamin using <i>Tecta</i> (Tectorin Alpha) regulation. The expression of <i>Tecta</i> increases in the apex area of the cochlear hair cells as they grow, and their activity is enhanced by sesame oil and sesamin. These results provide a novel mechanistic insight into the sesame oil activities and suggest that sesamin, the key constituent in sesame oil, is responsible for its auditory function related benefits, including protection of auditory cells and reversal of their impairments."	"The mechanism by which psychological stress elicits various physiological responses is unknown. We discovered a central master neural pathway in rats that drives autonomic and behavioral stress responses by connecting the corticolimbic stress circuits to the hypothalamus. Psychosocial stress signals from emotion-related forebrain regions activated a VGLUT1-positive glutamatergic pathway from the dorsal peduncular cortex and dorsal tenia tecta (DP/DTT), an unexplored prefrontal cortical area, to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), a hypothalamic autonomic center. Genetic ablation and optogenetics revealed that the DP/DTT→DMH pathway drives thermogenic, hyperthermic, and cardiovascular sympathetic responses to psychosocial stress without contributing to basal homeostasis. This pathway also mediates avoidance behavior from psychosocial stressors. Given the variety of stress responses driven by the DP/DTT→DMH pathway, the DP/DTT can be a potential target for treating psychosomatic disorders."	"Despite intensive ecotoxicological research, we still know relatively little about the ecological impacts of many environmental contaminants. Filling these knowledge gaps is particularly important regarding amphibians, because they play significant roles in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and their populations are declining worldwide. In this study, we investigated two pollutants that have been poorly studied in ecotoxicology despite their widespread occurrence in surface waters: the herbicide terbuthylazine and the pharmaceutical drug carbamazepine. We exposed two anuran species throughout their larval development to each of two environmentally relevant concentrations of each pollutant, and recorded mortality and 17 sub-lethal endpoints up to several months after exposure. Mortality was low and unrelated to treatment. In agile frogs (Rana dalmatina), we found that treatment with 0.3 μg/L terbuthylazine decreased tadpole activity and reduced fat bodies in juveniles, whereas treatment with 50 μg/L carbamazepine decreased spleen size and increased spleen pigmentation. In common toads (Bufo bufo), treatment with 0.003 μg/L terbuthylazine increased body mass at metamorphosis, treatment with 0.3 μg/L terbuthylazine increased the size of optic tecta, and treatment with 0.5 μg/L carbamazepine decreased hypothalamus size. Treatment with 50 μg/L carbamazepine reduced the feeding activity of toad tadpoles, decreased their production of anti-predatory bufadienolide toxins, and increased their body mass at metamorphosis; juvenile toads in this treatment group had reduced spleen pigmentation. Neither treatments affected the time to metamorphosis, post-metamorphic body mass, or sex ratios significantly. These results show that environmental levels of both terbuthylazine and carbamazepine can have several sub-lethal effects on anurans, which may be detrimental to individual fitness and population persistence in natural conditions. Our findings further highlight that toxic effects cannot be generalized between chemicals of similar structure, because the terbuthylazine effects we found do not conform with previously reported effects of atrazine, a related and extensively studied herbicide."	"Animals in the wild must balance food intake with vigilance for predators in order to survive. The optic tectum plays an important role in the integration of external (predators) and internal (energy status) cues related to predator defense and prey capture. However, the role of neuromodulators involved in tectal sensorimotor processing is poorly studied. Recently we showed that tectal CRFR1 receptor activation decreases food intake in the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, suggesting that CRF may modulate food intake/predator avoidance tradeoffs. Here we use a behavioral assay modeling food intake and predator avoidance to test the role of CRFR1 receptors and energy status in this tradeoff. We tested the predictions that 1) administering the CRFR1 antagonist NBI-27914 via the optic tecta will increase food intake and feeding-related behaviors in the presence of a predator, and 2) that prior food deprivation, which lowers tectal CRF content, will increase food intake and feeding-related behaviors in the presence of a predator. Pre-treatment with NBI-27914 did not prevent predator-induced reductions in food intake. Predator exposure altered feeding-related behaviors in a predictable manner. Pretreatment with NBI-27914 reduced the response of certain behaviors to a predator but also altered behaviors irrelevant of predator presence. Although 1-wk of food deprivation altered some non-feeding behaviors related to energy conservation strategy, food intake in the presence of a predator was not altered by prior food deprivation. Collectively, our data support a role for tectal CRFR1 in modulating discrete behavioral responses during predator avoidance/foraging tradeoffs."	"The tectorial membrane (TM) is an apical extracellular matrix (ECM) that hovers over the cochlear sensory epithelium and plays an essential role in auditory transduction. The TM forms facing the luminal endolymph-filled space and exhibits complex ultrastructure. Contrary to the current extracellular assembly model, which posits that secreted collagen fibrils and ECM components self-arrange in the extracellular space, we show that surface tethering of α-tectorin (TECTA) via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor is essential to prevent diffusion of secreted TM components. In the absence of surface-tethered TECTA, collagen fibrils aggregate randomly and fail to recruit TM glycoproteins. Conversely, conversion of TECTA into a transmembrane form results in a layer of collagens on the epithelial surface that fails to form a multilayered structure. We propose a three-dimensional printing model for TM morphogenesis: A new layer of ECM is printed on the cell surface concomitant with the release of a preestablished layer to generate the multilayered TM."	"Usher syndrome (USH) is a rare disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and sensorineural hearing loss. Several genes are responsible for the disease, but not all cases are explained by mutations in any of these, supporting the fact that there remain other unknown genes that have a role in the syndrome. We aimed to find the genetic cause of presumed USH patients lacking pathogenic mutations in the known USH genes.Whole exome sequencing was performed on a priori USH-diagnosed subjects from nine unrelated families, which had shown negative results for an USH-targeted panel in a previous study.We identified possible pathogenic variants in six of the studied families. One patient harbored mutations in REEP6 and TECTA, each gene tentatively causative of one of the two main symptoms of the disease, mimicking the syndrome. In three patients, only the retinal degeneration causative mutations were detected (involving EYS, WDR19, and CNGB1 genes). Another family manifested a dementia-linked retinal dystrophy dependent on an allele dosage in the GRN gene. Last, another case presented a homozygous mutation in ASIC5, a gene not yet associated with USH.Our findings demonstrate that pending cases should be clinically and genetically carefully assessed, since more patients than expected may be either related phenocopies or affected by a more complex disease encompassing additional symptoms rather than classical USH."	"On the basis of re-evaluation of morphological characters of the Lycoriella group of genera and subgenera, generic rank is given to the two species groups belonging to Lycoriella (Hemineurina) Frey, 1942 and to Lycoriella (Coelostylina) Tuomikoski, 1960. The Lycoriella (Hemineurina) inflata group, including the type species of the subgenus, Sciara conspicua Winnertz, 1867, is treated as the genus Hemineurina stat. n. and the Lycoriella (Hemineurina) vitticollis group as the genus Trichocoelina gen. n.

Coelostylina Tuomikoski, 1960 (type species Lycoriella (Coelostylina) freyi Tuomikoski, 1960) is a junior homonym of Coelostylina Kittl, 1894, and is renamed Stenacanthella nom. et stat. n. The genera are diagnosed and their phylogeny is discussed. Eight species are excluded from the Lycoriella group. They are transferred to the genera Bradysiopsis Tuomikoski, 1960, Camptochaeta Hippa Vilkamaa, 1994, Merizomma Sasakawa, 2003 stat. n. and Scatopsciara Edwards, 1927 (five species) or are for the time being regarded as incertae sedis (two species) and as nomen nudum (one name). Numerous nomenclatural corrections are made also in the genera Hemineurina Frey, Stenacanthella Vilkamaa Menzel and Trichocoelina Vilkamaa Menzel. Altogether 42 new combinations, three changes in status and one new synonym are presented.

"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNL) is the most prevalent sensory deficit in our environment. Next generation genomic sequencing (NGS) enables an aetiological diagnosis in a high percentage of patients. Our pilot study shows the results of the systematic application of NGS in a Childhood Hearing Loss Unit, as well as its implications for the clinical management of patients and their families.We included 27 patients diagnosed with SNL between 2014 and 2017, in which an environmental cause was ruled out. The genetic test consisted of a panel of genes analyzed by NGS (OTOgenicsTM panel). This panel has been designed to include genes associated with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss, early onset or late, syndromic and non-syndromic, regardless of their inheritance pattern.A genetic diagnosis was obtained in 56% (15/27) of the patients (62% in the case of bilateral SNL). Of the patients, 5/27 (19%) presented pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene and the rest pathogenic and / or probably pathogenic variants in other genes associated with isolated SNL (PR2X2, TECTA and STRC), with syndromic SNL (CHD7, GATA3, COL4A5, MITF and SOX10) or with syndromic and non-syndromic SNL (BSND, ACTG1 and CDH23).The aetiological diagnosis of SNL is a challenge in clinical practice. Our series demonstrates that it is possible to implement genetic diagnosis in the care routine and that this information has prognostic and therapeutic implications."	"The hippocampus, a brain region that is important for spatial navigation and episodic memory, benefits from a rich diversity of neuronal cell-types. Through the use of an intersectional genetic viral vector approach in mice, we report novel hippocampal neurons which we refer to as LINCs, as they are long-range inhibitory neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing cells. LINCs project to several extrahippocampal regions including the tenia tecta, diagonal band, and retromammillary nucleus, but also broadly target local CA1 cells. LINCs are thus both interneurons and projection neurons. LINCs display regular spiking non-pyramidal firing patterns, are primarily located in the stratum oriens or pyramidale, have sparsely spiny dendrites, and do not typically express somatostatin, VIP, or the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2. We further demonstrate that LINCs can strongly influence hippocampal function and oscillations, including interregional coherence. The identification and characterization of these novel cells advances our basic understanding of both hippocampal circuitry and neuronal diversity."	"<i>TECTA</i> is well known as a causative gene for autosomal dominant mid-frequency hearing loss observed in various populations. In this study, we performed next-generation sequencing analysis of a large Japanese hearing loss cohort, including eight hundred and twelve (812) subjects from unrelated autosomal dominant hearing loss families, to estimate the prevalence and phenotype-genotype correlations in patients with <i>TECTA</i> mutations. The prevalence of <i>TECTA</i> mutations in Japanese autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss families was found to be 3.2%. With regard to the type of hearing loss, the patients with mutations in the nidogen-like domain or ZA domain of <i>TECTA</i> showed varied audiograms. However, most of the patients with mutations in the ZP domain showed mid-frequency hearing loss. The rate of hearing deterioration in <i>TECTA</i>-associated hearing loss patients and in the normal hearing Japanese control population were the same and regression lines for each group were parallel. We carried out haplotype analysis for four families which had one recurring missense variant, c.5597C&gt;T (p.Thr1866Met). Our results revealed four different haplotypes, suggesting that this mutation occurred independently in each family. In conclusion, <i>TECTA</i> variants represent the second largest cause of autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss in Japan. The hearing loss progression observed in the patients with <i>TECTA</i> mutations might reflect presbycusis. The c.5597C&gt;T mutation occurred in a mutational hot spot and is observed in many ethnic populations."	"The optic tectum rapidly inhibits food intake when a visual threat is present. Anatomical and electrophysiological evidence support a role for neuropeptide Y (NPY), originating from cells in the thalamus, in the tectal inhibition of prey capture. Here we test the hypothesis that tectal NPY receptor type 2 (NPY2R) influences prey-capture and predator-avoidance responses in the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. We tested two questions: 1) Does tectal NPY administration decrease food intake and alter prey-capture behavior? 2) Does tectal administration of a NPY2R antagonist increase food intake, alter prey-capture behavior, and alter predator avoidance behavior? NPY microinjected bilaterally into the tecta failed to significantly alter food intake at any dose tested, although predator presence significantly reduced food intake. However, NPY differentially altered discrete components of prey capture including increasing the latency to contact food and reducing the amount of time in contact with food. These effects were blocked by the NPY2R antagonist BIIE0246. Additionally, BIIE0246 elevated food intake on its own after bilateral tectal microinjection. Furthermore, BIIE0246 reversed the reduction of food intake caused by exposure to a predator. Overall, these findings indicate that tectal NPY2R activation causes frogs to consume food more quickly, which may be adaptive in predator-rich environments. Blocking tectal NPY2R increases baseline food intake and reduces or eliminates predator-induced changes in prey capture and food intake."	"Literature review of the genetic etiology of hearing loss (HL) in the African American (AA) population.PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL were accessed from 1966 to 2018.PRISMA guidelines were followed. Search terms included permutations of &quot;hearing loss,&quot; &quot;African American,&quot; &quot;black,&quot; and &quot;genetic&quot;; &quot;African American&quot; was then cross-referenced against documented HL genes. AA subjects included in multiethnic cohorts of genetic HL testing were identified by searching the key terms &quot;hearing loss&quot; and &quot;ethnic cohort&quot; and &quot;genetic.&quot; The Q-Genie tool was used in the quality assessment of included studies. An allele frequency meta-analysis of pathogenic GJB2 variants in the AA population was performed and stratified by hearing status.Four hundred seventeen articles were reviewed, and 26 met our inclusion criteria. Ten studies were included in the GJB2 meta-analysis. In the general AA population, pathogenic GJB2 variants are rare, including the 35delG allele, which displayed a carrier frequency of 0.05%. Pathogenic variants were discovered in seven nonsyndromic HL genes (GJB2, MYO3A, TECTA, STRC, OTOF, MYH14, TMC1), eight syndromic HL genes, and one mitochondrial HL gene. Recent comprehensive genetic testing using custom genetic HL testing platforms has yielded only a 26% molecular diagnosis rate for HL etiologies in the AA population.Investigators should be encouraged to provide an ethnic breakdown of results. Sparse literature and poor diagnosis rates indicate that genes involved in HL in the AA population have yet to be identified. Future explorative investigations using next-generation sequencing technologies, such as whole-exome sequencing, into the AA population are warranted."	"Many mutations in the α-tectorin gene (TECTA) have been reported to cause non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in either a dominant or recessive inheritance pattern. Among the identified TECTA mutations, H1400Y has been associated with NSHL in two independent studies. However, its exact role in contributing to genetic hearing loss remains elusive.We herein report the whole-exome sequencing of a proband presenting with prelingual, non-progressive, mild-to-moderate hearing loss in a simplex family. By using trio-based whole-exome sequencing, we found two heterozygous mutations of R1890C and H1400Y in the ZP and ZA domains of TECTA, respectively. R1890C, previously reported as a pathogenic autosomal dominant mutation of genetic hearing loss, was found to be inherited in a de novo pattern, causing hearing loss in the proband. By contrast, H1400Y was not segregated in this family, and one family member with normal hearing also carried the H1400Y mutation.According to the hearing loss-specific American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, we conclude that H1400Y should be disqualified as a cause of genetic hearing loss. True pathogenic variants causing genetic hearing loss should be more deliberately reported in accordance with ACMG guidelines."	"Outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia bundle deflection opens mechanoelectrical transduction channels at the tips of the stereocilia from the middle and short rows, while bundle cohesion is maintained owing to the presence of horizontal top connectors. Here, we used a quantitative noncontact atomic force microscopy method to investigate stereocilia bundle stiffness and damping, when stimulated at acoustic frequencies and nanometer distances from the bundle. Stereocilia bundle mechanics were determined in stereocilin-deficient mice lacking top connectors and with detached tectorial membrane (<i>Strc</i><sup>-/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup> double knockout) and heterozygous littermate controls (<i>Strc</i><sup>+/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup>). A substantial decrease in bundle stiffness and damping by ~60 and ~74% on postnatal days P13 to P15 was observed when top connectors were absent. Additionally, we followed bundle mechanics during OHC top connectors development between P9 and P15 and quantified the observed increase in OHC bundle stiffness and damping in <i>Strc</i><sup>+/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice while no significant change was detected in <i>Strc</i><sup>-/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup> animals."	"To explore the molecular basis for an individual with postnatal deafness and provide genetic counseling for her family.Following extraction of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples, 127 genes associated with deafness were subjected to targeted capturing and next generation sequencing. Suspected mutation was verified by Sanger sequencing.The proband was found to carry a homozygous c.1893C&gt;A mutation in the TECTA gene, which is located in the tectorial membrane of inner ear and may cause premature termination of translation of TECTA protein. In addition, two heterozygous mutations, c.13010C&gt;T and c.12790G&gt;A, were found in the USH2A gene. Whilst the former is likely to be pathogenic, the latter has unknown clinical significance. Further analysis suggested that all three mutations have derived from the parents of the proband.The homozygous c.1893C&gt;A mutation of the TECTA gene probably underlies the proband's hearing loss which conformed to an autosomal recessive inheritance."	"Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) recorded from the ear canal in the absence of sound reflect cochlear amplification, an outer hair cell (OHC) process required for the extraordinary sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Although wild-type mice rarely emit, those with mutations that influence the tectorial membrane (TM) show an incidence of SOAEs similar to that in humans. In this report, we characterized mice with a missense mutation in <i>Tecta,</i> a gene required for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix within the core of the TM. Mice heterozygous for the Y1870C mutation (<i>Tecta<sup>Y1870C/+</sup></i> ) are prolific emitters, despite a moderate hearing loss. Additionally, Kimura's membrane, into which the OHC stereocilia insert, separates from the main body of the TM, except at apical cochlear locations. Multimodal SOAEs are also observed in <i>Tecta<sup>Y1870C/+</sup></i> mice where energy is present at frequencies that are integer multiples of a lower-frequency SOAE (the primary). Second-harmonic SOAEs, at twice the frequency of a lower-frequency primary, are the most frequently observed. These secondary SOAEs are found in spatial regions where stimulus-evoked OAEs are small or in the noise floor. Introduction of high-level suppressors just above the primary SOAE frequency reduce or eliminate both primary and second-harmonic SOAEs. In contrast, second-harmonic SOAEs are not affected by suppressors, either above or below the second-harmonic SOAE frequency, even when they are much larger in amplitude. Hence, second-harmonic SOAEs do not appear to be spatially separated from their primaries, a finding that has implications for cochlear mechanics and the consequences of changes to TM structure."	"Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is a common disorder characterized by a huge genetic heterogeneity. The definition of a correct molecular diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling, recurrence risk estimation, and therapeutic options. From 20 to 40% of patients carry mutations in <i>GJB2</i> gene, thus, in more than half of cases it is necessary to look for causative variants in the other genes so far identified (~100). In this light, the use of next-generation sequencing technologies has proved to be the best solution for mutational screening, even though it is not always conclusive. Here we describe a combined approach, based on targeted re-sequencing (TRS) of 96 HHL genes followed by high-density SNP arrays, aimed at the identification of the molecular causes of non-syndromic HHL (NSHL). This strategy has been applied to study 103 Italian unrelated cases, negative for mutations in <i>GJB2</i>, and led to the characterization of 31% of them (i.e., 37% of familial and 26.3% of sporadic cases). In particular, TRS revealed <i>TECTA</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> genes as major players in the Italian population. Furthermore, two <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>ACTG</i>1 have been identified and investigated through protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, confirming their likely pathogenic effect. Among the selected patients analyzed by SNP arrays (negative to TRS, or with a single variant in a recessive gene) a molecular diagnosis was reached in ~36% of cases, highlighting the importance to look for large insertions/deletions. Moreover, copy number variants analysis led to the identification of the first case of uniparental disomy involving <i>LOXHD1</i> gene. Overall, taking into account the contribution of <i>GJB2</i>, plus the results from TRS and SNP arrays, it was possible to reach a molecular diagnosis in ~51% of NSHL cases. These data proved the usefulness of a combined approach for the analysis of NSHL and for the definition of the epidemiological picture of HHL in the Italian population."	"In mammals, the brain decreases in mass and volume as a function of age. The current study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate age-related changes in brain mass and volume in birds. Following perfusion, brains from young and old homing pigeons were weighed on a balance and orthogonal measurements of the telencephalon, cerebellum, and tecta were obtained with a digital caliper. It was found that older pigeons had heavier brains than younger pigeons, a difference that remained after controlling for body mass. Additionally, older pigeons had on average greater estimated telencephalon volumes than younger pigeons, again also after controlling for body mass. Cerebellum and right tectum volumes also differed between age groups after controlling for body mass, with older pigeons having a larger cerebellum and right tectum than younger pigeons. In sum, brains are on average heavier and larger in old pigeons, which display age-related cognitive decline, compared to young adult pigeons. The larger brain in older homing pigeons also lies in stark contrast with aging of the mammalian brain."	"The subgenus Pseudomegachile Friese of the large genus Megachile Latreille is revised for the Western Palaearctic region, Iran, and the Arabian Peninsula. Twenty species are recognized, of which five are new: Megachile blepharis Dorchin Praz from Israel, M. plumigera Dorchin Praz from Oman and the United Arab Emirates, M. syriaca Dorchin Praz from Syria and Turkey, M. yezidica Dorchin Praz from Turkey and Iran, and M. maxschwarzi Dorchin Praz from Iran and Central Asia.

"TMC1"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Mechanotransduction channels have been proposed as force sensors in various physiological processes, such as hearing and touch. In particular, TMC1 has been shown to constitute the pore of hair cell mechanotransduction channels, but little is known about how force is sensed by TMC channels. Here, we identify UNC-44/ankyrin as an essential component of the TMC-1 mechanotransduction channel complex in the sensory cilia of Caenorhabditis elegans mechanoreceptor neurons. Ankyrin binds indirectly to TMC-1 via evolutionarily conserved CIB proteins, which are required for TMC-1-mediated mechanosensation in C. elegans OLQ neurons and body wall muscles. Mechanosensory activity conferred by ectopically expressed TMCs in mechanoinsensitive neurons depends on both ankyrin and CIB proteins, indicating that the ankyrin-CIB subcomplex is required for TMC mechanosensitivity. Our work indicates that ankyrin is a long-sought intracellular tether that transmits force to TMC mechanotransduction channels."	"Noncanonical splice-site mutations are an important cause of inherited diseases. Based on in vitro and stem-cell-based studies, some splice-site variants show a stronger splice defect than expected based on their predicted effects, suggesting that other sequence motifs influence the outcome. We investigated whether splice defects due to human-inherited-disease-associated variants in noncanonical splice-site sequences in <i>ABCA4</i>, <i>DMD</i>, and <i>TMC1</i> could be rescued by strengthening the splice site on the other side of the exon. Noncanonical 5'- and 3'-splice-site variants were selected. Rescue variants were introduced based on an increase in predicted splice-site strength, and the effects of these variants were analyzed using in vitro splice assays in HEK293T cells. Exon skipping due to five variants in noncanonical splice sites of exons in <i>ABCA4</i>, <i>DMD</i>, and <i>TMC1</i> could be partially or completely rescued by increasing the predicted strengths of the other splice site of the same exon. We named this mechanism &quot;splicing interdependency&quot;, and it is likely based on exon recognition by splicing machinery. Awareness of this interdependency is of importance in the classification of noncanonical splice-site variants associated with disease and may open new opportunities for treatments."	"To determine the type and carrier rate of deafness-related variants in Dongguan, China.A total of 16 182 subjects were screened. Heel blood samples were collected from newborns, while peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the remainders. For each individual, 100 variations of 18 deafness susceptibility genes were detected.In total 1631 deafness-related variants (including 5 homozygous mutations) were detected, which gave a detection rate of 10.08%. The detection rate of SLC26A4 gene variants was the highest (845 cases, 5.22%), which was followed by GJB2 (673 cases, 4.16%), GJB3 (100 cases, 0.62%), TMC1 (12 cases, 0.07%), and MYO15A (1 case, 0.01%). The detection rate for GJB2 c.235delC variant was the highest (524 cases, 3.24%), which was followed by SLC26A4 IVS7-2A&gt;G variant (270 cases, 1.67%). Thirty three individuals (0.20%) carried two variants at the same time, 7 of them (0.04%) carried compound heterozygous variants of the same gene.To expand the range of screening can help with determination of the carrier status and provision of early intervention and genetic counseling for the examinees."	"Perception of sound is initiated by mechanically-gated ion channels at the tips of stereocilia. Mature mammalian auditory hair cells require transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) for mechanotransduction and mutations of the cognate genetic sequences result in dominant or recessive heritable deafness forms in humans and mice. In contrast, zebrafish lateral line hair cells, which detect water motion, require Tmc2a and Tmc2b. Here, we use standard and multiplex genome editing in conjunction with functional and behavioral assays to determine the reliance of zebrafish hearing and vestibular organs on Tmc proteins. Surprisingly, our approach using multiple mutant alleles demonstrates that hearing in zebrafish is not dependent on Tmc1, nor is it fully dependent on Tmc2a and Tmc2b. Hearing however is absent in triple-knockout zebrafish that lack Tmc1, Tmc2a, and Tmc2b. These outcomes reveal a striking resemblance of Tmc protein reliance in the vestibular sensory epithelia of mammals to the maculae of zebrafish. Moreover, our findings disclose a logic of Tmc use where hearing depends on a complement of Tmc proteins beyond those employed to sense water motion."	"Systemically administered aminoglycoside antibiotics can enter inner ear hair cells and trigger apoptosis. However, the in vivo route(s) by which aminoglycoside antibiotics enter hair cells remains controversial. Aminoglycosides can enter mouse hair cells by endocytosis or by permeation through transmembrane ion channels such as sensory mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, P2X channels, Piezo2-containing ion channels, or a combination of these routes. Transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) and TMC2 are essential for sensory MET and appear to be the pore-forming components of sensory MET channels. The present study tested the hypothesis that systemic fluorescent gentamicin enters mouse hair cells predominantly through sensory MET channels. We employed Tmc1<sup>Δ</sup>, Tmc2<sup>Δ</sup>, and Tmc1::mCherry mice. In Tmc1::mCherry mice, the transgene was integrated on the X chromosome, resulting in mosaic expression of TMC1-mCherry in the hair cells of female heterozygous mice. After systemic administration of gentamicin-conjugated Texas Red (GTTR) into Tmc1<sup>Δ</sup>;Tmc2<sup>Δ</sup> mice and wild-type mice at postnatal day 4 (P4), robust GTTR fluorescence was detected in wild-type hair cells, whereas little or no GTTR fluorescence was detected in Tmc1<sup>Δ</sup>;Tmc2<sup>Δ</sup> hair cells. When GTTR was injected into developing mice at P0, P2, P4, or P6, the GTTR fluorescent intensity gradually increased from P0 to P4 in wild-type hair cells, whereas the intensity was stably low from P0 through P6 in Tmc1<sup>Δ</sup>;Tmc2<sup>Δ</sup> hair cells. The increase in the GTTR intensity coincided with the spatio-temporal onset of sensory MET in wild-type hair cells. In Tmc1::mCherry cochleae, only hair cells that showed a significant uptake of systemic GTTR took up FM1-43. Transmission electron microscopy could detect no disruption of normal endocytosis at the apical surface of Tmc1<sup>Δ</sup>;Tmc2<sup>Δ</sup> hair cells in vitro. These results provide substantial novel evidence that in vivo gentamicin enters neonatal mouse hair cells predominantly through sensory MET channels and not via endocytosis."	"Deafness is the most common sensory disability in humans affecting all aspects of life. Approximately 50% of congenital deafness is hereditary and about half of genetic deafness is still unsolved. To date, more than 150 genes are known to cause hearing loss worldwide, with specific genes contributing to deafness in distinct populations. Of these, more than 20 genes are involved in deafness among the Jewish Israeli hearing-impaired population. The most common gene in many worldwide populations, including Israel, is GJB2, which encodes the connexin 26 protein. The second most common gene among Jews is TMC1, with most pathogenic variants found only among Jews of Moroccan origin. Most other pathogenic variants found in the Jewish population are origin-specific and not found in other Jewish ethnic groups or in other worldwide populations. In patients where hereditary deafness is suspected, known variants in the specific ethnicity are routinely examined. In Israel, the GJB2 gene is screened in all cases of hereditary deafness and the TMC1 gene is screened in deaf persons of Jewish Moroccan origin. In cases where no variant is found in a known gene, more comprehensive diagnostic tests should be used. Since the beginning of the deep sequencing era, less than a decade ago, the number of deafness-related genes in the Jewish population has increased by threefold. Identifying the pathogenic variant makes it possible to study molecular pathogenesis, to anticipate and understand the prognosis, to calculate probability of concomitant morbidity, to offer prenatal diagnosis, prevent recurrence of deafness in the family and early rehabilitation. Currently, cochlear implant offers the greatest chance for rehabilitation. The hope is that understanding the molecular pathogenesis will in the future lead to personalized medical treatment. We review the genetics of deafness, with an emphasis on the Jewish population in Israel, new diagnostic methods and suggest a diagnostic algorithm and future treatment methods."	"Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two <i>lhfpl5</i> genes (<i>lhfpl5a</i> and <i>lhfpl5b</i>), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed. Here we show that the zebrafish <i>lhfpl5</i> genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: <i>lhfpl5a</i> expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while <i>lhfpl5b</i> expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, <i>lhfpl5a</i> mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of <i>lhfpl5b</i> affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both <i>lhfpl5a</i> and <i>lhfpl5b</i> mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins."	"Actin-rich structures, like stereocilia and microvilli, are assembled with precise control of length, diameter, and relative spacing. By quantifying actin-core dimensions of stereocilia from phalloidin-labeled mouse cochleas, we demonstrated that inner hair cell stereocilia developed in specific stages, where a widening phase is sandwiched between two lengthening phases. Moreover, widening of the second-tallest stereocilia rank (row 2) occurred simultaneously with the appearance of mechanotransduction. Correspondingly, Tmc1<sup>KO/KO</sup>;Tmc2<sup>KO/KO</sup> or Tmie<sup>KO/KO</sup> hair cells, which lack transduction, have significantly altered stereocilia lengths and diameters, including a narrowed row 2. EPS8 and the short splice isoform of MYO15A, identity markers for mature row 1 (the tallest row), lost their row exclusivity in transduction mutants. GNAI3, another member of the mature row 1 complex, accumulated at mutant row 1 tips at considerably lower levels than in wild-type bundles. Alterations in stereocilia dimensions and in EPS8 distribution seen in transduction mutants were mimicked by block of transduction channels of cochlear explants in culture. In addition, proteins normally concentrated at mature row 2 tips were also distributed differently in transduction mutants; the heterodimeric capping protein subunit CAPZB and its partner TWF2 never concentrated at row 2 tips like they do in wild-type bundles. The altered distribution of marker proteins in transduction mutants was accompanied by increased variability in stereocilia length. Transduction channels thus specify and maintain row identity, control addition of new actin filaments to increase stereocilia diameter, and coordinate stereocilia height within rows."	"Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory disorder worldwide and genetic factors contribute to approximately half of congenital HL cases. HL is subject to extensive genetic heterogeneity, rendering molecular diagnosis difficult. Mutations of the transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) gene cause hearing defects in humans and mice. The precise function of TMC1 protein in the inner ear is unknown, although it is predicted to be involved in functional maturation of cochlear hair cells. TMC1 mutations result in autosomal recessive (DFNB7/11) and sometimes dominant (DFNA36) nonsyndromic HL. Mutations in TMC1 are responsible for a significant portion of HL, particularly in consanguineous populations. To evaluate the importance of TMC1 mutations in the Saudi population, we used a combination of autozygome-guided candidate gene mutation analysis and targeted next generation sequencing in 366 families with HL previously shown to lack mutations in GJB2. We identified 12 families that carried five causative TMC1 mutations; including three novel (c.362+3A &gt; G; c.758C &gt; T [p.Ser253Phe]; c.1396_1398delACC [p.Asn466del]) and two reported mutations (c.100C &gt; T [p.Arg34Ter]; c.1714G &gt; A [p.Asp572Asn]). Each of the identified recessive mutation was classified as severe, by both age of onset and severity of HL. Similarly, consistent with the previously reported dominant variant p.Asp572Asn, the HL phenotype was progressive. Eight families in our cohort were found to share the pathogenic p.Arg34Ter mutation and linkage disequilibrium was observed between p.Arg34Ter and SNPs investigated. Our results indicate that TMC1 mutations account for about 3.3% (12/366) of Saudi HL cases and that the recurrent TMC1 mutation p.Arg34Ter is likely to be a founder mutation."	"Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) 1 and 2 are required for the mechanotransduction of mouse inner ear hair cells and localize to the site of mechanotransduction in mouse hair cell stereocilia. However, it remains unclear whether TMC1 and TMC2 are indeed ion channels and whether they can sense mechanical force directly. Here we express TMC1 from the green sea turtle (CmTMC1) and TMC2 from the budgerigar (MuTMC2) in insect cells, purify and reconstitute the proteins, and show that liposome-reconstituted CmTMC1 and MuTMC2 proteins possess ion channel activity. Furthermore, by applying pressure to proteoliposomes, we demonstrate that both CmTMC1 and MuTMC2 proteins can indeed respond to mechanical stimuli. In addition, CmTMC1 mutants corresponding to human hearing loss mutants exhibit reduced or no ion channel activity. Taken together, our results show that the CmTMC1 and MuTMC2 proteins are pore-forming subunits of mechanosensitive ion channels, supporting TMC1 and TMC2 as hair cell transduction channels."	"Hearing sensation relies on the mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel of cochlear hair cells, in which transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) and transmembrane channel-like 2 (TMC2) have been proposed to be the pore-forming subunits in mammals. TMCs were also found to regulate biological processes other than MET in invertebrates, ranging from sensations to motor function. However, whether TMCs have a non-MET role remains elusive in mammals. Here, we report that in mouse hair cells, TMC1, but not TMC2, provides a background leak conductance, with properties distinct from those of the MET channels. By cysteine substitutions in TMC1, we characterized four amino acids that are required for the leak conductance. The leak conductance is graded in a frequency-dependent manner along the length of the cochlea and is indispensable for action potential firing. Taken together, our results show that TMC1 confers a background leak conductance in cochlear hair cells, which may be critical for the acquisition of sound-frequency and -intensity."	"Mechanotransduction by hair cell stereocilia lies at the heart of sound detection in vertebrates. Considerable effort has been put forth to identify proteins that comprise the hair cell mechanotransduction apparatus. TMC1, a member of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family, was identified as a core protein of the mechanotransduction complex in hair cells. However, the inability of TMC1 to traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum in heterologous cellular systems has hindered efforts to characterize its function and fully identify its role in mechanotransduction. We developed a novel approach that allowed for the detection of uncharacterized protein regions, which preclude trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM) in heterologous cells. Tagging N-terminal fragments of TMC1 with Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and GFP fusion reporter, which intrinsically label PM in HEK293 cells, indicated that residues at the edges of amino acid sequence 138-168 invoke intracellular localization and/or degradation. This signal is able to preclude surface localization of PM protein AQP3 in HEK293 cells. Substitutions of the residues by alanine or serine corroborated that the information determining the intracellular retention is present within amino acid sequence 138-168 of TMC1 N-terminus. This novel signal may preclude the proper trafficking of TMC1 to the PM in heterologous cells."	"Hair cell mechanoelectrical transducer channels are opened by deflections of the hair bundle about a resting position set by incompletely understood adaptation mechanisms. We used three characteristics to define adaptation in hair cell mutants of transmembrane channel-like proteins, TMC1 and TMC2, which are considered to be channel constituents. The results obtained demonstrate that the three characteristics are not equivalent, and raise doubts about simple models in which intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates adaptation. Adaptation is faster and more effective in TMC1-containing than in TMC2-containing transducer channels. This result ties adaptation to the channel complex, and suggests that TMC1 is a better isoform for use in cochlear hair cells. We describe a TMC1 point mutation, D569N, that reduces the resting open probability and Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of the transducer channels, comprising properties that may contribute to the deafness phenotype.Recordings of mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) currents in cochlear hair cells were made in mice with mutations of transmembrane channel-like (TMC) protein to examine the effects on fast transducer adaptation. Adaptation was faster and more complete in Tmc2<sup>-/-</sup> than in Tmc1<sup>-/-</sup> , although this disparity was not explained by differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability or Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx between the two isoforms, with TMC2 having the larger permeability. We made a mouse mutation, Tmc1 p.D569N, homologous to a human DFNA36 deafness mutation, which also had MET channels with lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> -permeability but showed better fast adaptation than wild-type Tmc1<sup>+/+</sup> channels. Consistent with the more effective adaptation in Tmc1 p.D569N, the resting probability of MET channel opening was smaller. The three TMC variants studied have comparable single-channel conductances, although the lack of correlation between channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and adaptation opposes the hypothesis that adaptation is controlled simply by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the channels. During the first postnatal week of mouse development, the MET currents amplitude grew, and transducer adaptation became faster and more effective. We attribute changes in adaptation partly to a developmental switch from TMC2- to TMC1- containing channels and partly to an increase in channel expression. More complete and faster adaptation, coupled with larger MET currents, may account for the sole use of TMC1 in the adult cochlear hair cells."	"The conversion of force into an electrical cellular signal is mediated by the opening of different types of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), including TREK/TRAAK K<sub>2P</sub> channels, Piezo1/2, TMEM63/OSCA, and TMC1/2. Mechanoelectrical transduction plays a key role in hearing, balance, touch, and proprioception and is also implicated in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and breathing. Thus, dysfunction of MSCs is associated with a variety of inherited and acquired disease states. Significant progress has recently been made in identifying these channels, solving their structure, and understanding the gating of both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing MSCs. Besides prototypical activation by membrane tension, additional gating mechanisms involving channel curvature and/or tethered elements are at play."	"In the past two decades, transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins have attracted a significant amount of research interest, because mutations of Tmc1 lead to hereditary deafness. As evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins, TMC proteins are widely involved in diverse sensorimotor functions of many species, such as hearing, chemosensation, egg laying, and food texture detection. Interestingly, recent structural and physiological studies suggest that TMC channels may share a similar membrane topology with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel TMEM16 and the mechanically activated OSCA1.2/TMEM63 channel. Namely, these channels form dimers and each subunit consists of ten transmembrane segments. Despite this important structural insight, a key question remains: what is the gating mechanism of TMC channels? The major technical hurdle to answer this question is that the reconstitution of TMC proteins as functional ion channels has been challenging in mammalian heterologous systems. Since TMC channels are conserved across taxa, genetic studies of TMC channels in model organisms such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish may provide us critical information on the physiological function and regulation of TMCs. Here, we present a comparative overview on the diverse functions of TMC channels in different species."	"Mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) currents were recorded from cochlear hair cells in mice with mutations of transmembrane channel-like protein TMC1 to study the effects on MET channel properties. We characterized a <i>Tmc1</i> mouse with a single-amino-acid mutation (D569N), homologous to a dominant human deafness mutation. Measurements were made in both <i>Tmc2</i> wild-type and <i>Tmc2</i> knockout mice. By 30 d, <i>Tmc1</i> pD569N heterozygote mice were profoundly deaf, and there was substantial loss of outer hair cells (OHCs). MET current in OHCs of <i>Tmc1</i> pD569N mutants developed over the first neonatal week to attain a maximum amplitude one-third the size of that in <i>Tmc1</i> wild-type mice, similar at apex and base, and lacking the tonotopic size gradient seen in wild type. The MET-channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability was reduced 3-fold in <i>Tmc1</i> pD569N homozygotes, intermediate deficits being seen in heterozygotes. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability resembled that of the <i>Tmc1 p</i>M412K <i>Beethoven</i> mutant, a previously studied semidominant mouse mutation. The MET channel unitary conductance, assayed by single-channel recordings and by measurements of current noise, was unaffected in mutant apical OHCs. We show that, in contrast to the <i>Tmc1</i> M412K mutant, there was reduced expression of the TMC1 D569N channel at the transduction site assessed by immunolabeling, despite the persistence of tip links. The reduction in MET channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability seen in both mutants may be the proximate cause of hair-cell apoptosis, but changes in bundle shape and protein expression in <i>Tmc1</i> D569N suggest another role for TMC1 apart from forming the channel."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a highly heterogeneous disease involving more than 70 pathogenic genes. However, most ARNSHL families have small-sized pedigrees with limited genetic information, rendering challenges for the molecular diagnosis of these patients. Therefore, we attempted to establish a strategy for identifying deleterious variants associated with ARNSHL by applying proband whole-exome sequencing (proband-WES). Aside from desiring to improve molecular diagnostic rates, we also aimed to search for novel deafness genes shared by patients with similar phenotype, making up for the deficiency of small ARNSHL families. In this study, 48.5% (16/33) families were detected the pathogenic variants in eight known deafness genes, including 10 novel variants identified in <i>TMPRSS3</i> (MIM 605551), <i>MYO15A</i> (MIM 602666), <i>TMC1</i> (MIM 606706), <i>ADGRV1</i> (MIM 602851), and <i>PTPRQ</i> (MIM 603317). Apart from six novel variants with a truncating effect (nonsense, deletion, insertion, and splice-site), four novel missense variants were not found in 200 unrelated control population by using Sanger sequencing. It is important to note that none of novel genes were shared across different pedigrees, indicating that a larger sample size might be needed. Proband-WES is a cost-effective and precise way of identifying causative variants in nuclear families with ARNSHL. This economical strategy may be appropriated as a clinical application to provide molecular diagnostics, genetic counseling, and individualized health maintenance measures for patients with ARNSHL at hearing clinics."	"Since most dominant human mutations are single nucleotide substitutions<sup>1,2</sup>, we explored gene editing strategies to disrupt dominant mutations efficiently and selectively without affecting wild-type alleles. However, single nucleotide discrimination can be difficult to achieve<sup>3</sup> because commonly used endonucleases, such as Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), can tolerate up to seven mismatches between guide RNA (gRNA) and target DNA. Furthermore, the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) in some Cas9 enzymes can tolerate mismatches with the target DNA<sup>3,4</sup>. To circumvent these limitations, we screened 14 Cas9/gRNA combinations for specific and efficient disruption of a nucleotide substitution that causes the dominant progressive hearing loss, DFNA36. As a model for DFNA36, we used Beethoven mice<sup>5</sup>, which harbor a point mutation in Tmc1, a gene required for hearing that encodes a pore-forming subunit of mechanosensory transduction channels in inner-ear hair cells<sup>6</sup>. We identified a PAM variant of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9-KKH) that selectively and efficiently disrupted the mutant allele, but not the wild-type Tmc1/TMC1 allele, in Beethoven mice and in a DFNA36 human cell line. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated SaCas9-KKH delivery prevented deafness in Beethoven mice up to one year post injection. Analysis of current ClinVar entries revealed that ~21% of dominant human mutations could be targeted using a similar approach."	"Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory-neural disorder with excessive clinical and genetic heterogeneity, which negatively affects life quality. Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is the most common form of the disease with no specific genotype-phenotype correlation in most of the cases. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a powerful tool to overcome the problem of finding mutations in heterogeneous disorders.A comprehensive clinical and pedigree examination was performed on a multiplex family from Khuzestan province suffering from hereditary HL. Direct sequencing of GJB2 and genetic linkage analysis of DFNB1A/B was accomplished. WES was utilized to find possible genetic etiology of the disease. Co-segregation analysis of the candidate variant was done. High resolution melting analysis was applied to detect variant status in 50 healthy matched controls.Clinical investigations suggested ARNSHL in the pedigree. The family was negative for DFNB1A/B. WES revealed a novel nonsense mutation, c.256G &gt; T (p.Glu86*), in TMC1 segregating with the phenotype in the pedigree. The variant was absent in the controls.Here, we report successful application of WES to identify the molecular pathogenesis of ARNSHL in a large family. The novel nonsense TMC1 variant meets the criteria of being pathogenic according to the ACMG-AMP variant interpretation guideline."
"CABP2"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Hereditary hearing loss (HL) can originate from mutations in one of many genes involved in the complex process of hearing. CABP2 mutations have been reported to cause moderate HL. Here, we report the whole exome sequencing (WES) of a proband presenting with prelingual, severe HL in an Iranian family.A comprehensive family history was obtained, and clinical evaluations and pedigree analysis were performed in the family with 2 affected members. After excluding mutations in the GJB2 gene and 7 other most common autosomal recessive nonsyndromic HL (ARNSHL) genes via Sanger sequencing and genetic linkage analysis in the family, WES was utilized to find the possible etiology of the disease.WES results showed a novel rare variant (c.311G&gt;A) in the CABP2gene.This missense variant in the exon 4 of the CABP2gene meets the criteria of being pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) interpretation guidelines.Up to now, 3 mutations have been reported for the CABP2gene to cause moderate ARNSHL in different populations. Our results show that CABP2variantsalso cause severe ARNSHL, adding CABP2to the growing list of genes that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity. Expanding our understanding of the mutational spectrum of HL genes is an important step in providing the correct clinical molecular interpretation and diagnosis for patients."	"Epigenetic variation may result from selection for complex traits related to metabolic processes or appear in the course of adaptation to mediate responses to exogenous stressors. Moreover epigenetic marks, in particular the DNA methylation state, of specific loci are driven by genetic variation. In this sense, polymorphism with major gene effects on metabolic and cell signaling processes, like the variation of the ryanodine receptors in skeletal muscle, may affect DNA methylation.DNA-Methylation profiles were generated applying Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) on 17 Musculus longissimus dorsi samples. We examined DNA methylation in skeletal muscle of pig breeds differing in metabolic type, Duroc and Pietrain. We also included F2 crosses of these breeds to get a first clue to DNA methylation sites that may contribute to breed differences. Moreover, we compared DNA methylation in muscle tissue of Pietrain pigs differing in genotypes at the gene encoding the Ca2+ release channel (RYR1) that largely affects muscle physiology.More than 2000 differently methylated sites were found between breeds including changes in methylation profiles of METRNL, IDH3B, COMMD6, and SLC22A18, genes involved in lipid metabolism. Depending on RYR1 genotype there were 1060 differently methylated sites including some functionally related genes, such as CABP2 and EHD, which play a role in buffering free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> or interact with the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger.The change in the level of methylation between the breeds is probably the result of the long-term selection process for quantitative traits involving an infinite number of genes, or it may be the result of a major gene mutation that plays an important role in muscle metabolism and triggers extensive compensatory processes."	"Detecting associations between genomic changes and phenotypic differences is fundamental to understanding how phenotypes evolved. By systematically screening for parallel amino acid substitutions, we detected known as well as novel cases (Strc, Tecta, and Cabp2) of parallelism between echolocating bats and toothed whales in proteins that could contribute to high-frequency hearing adaptations. Our screen also showed that echolocating mammals exhibit an unusually high number of parallel substitutions in fast-twitch muscle fiber proteins. Both echolocating bats and toothed whales produce an extremely rapid call rate when homing in on their prey, which was shown in bats to be powered by specialized superfast muscles. We show that these genes with parallel substitutions (<i>Casq1</i>, <i>Atp2a1</i>, <i>Myh2</i>, and <i>Myl1</i>) are expressed in the superfast sound-producing muscle of bats. Furthermore, we found that the calcium storage protein calsequestrin 1 of the little brown bat and the bottlenose dolphin functionally converged in its ability to form calcium-sequestering polymers at lower calcium concentrations, which may contribute to rapid calcium transients required for superfast muscle physiology. The proteins that our genomic screen detected could be involved in the convergent evolution of vocalization in echolocating mammals by potentially contributing to both rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and increased shortening velocities in superfast muscles."	"CaBPs are a family of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins related to calmodulin. Two CaBP family members, CaBP1 and CaBP2, are highly expressed in the cochlea. Here, we investigated the significance of CaBP1 and CaBP2 for hearing in mice lacking expression of these proteins (CaBP1 KO and CaBP2 KO) using auditory brain responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). In CaBP1 KO mice, ABR wave I was larger in amplitude, and shorter in latency and faster in decay, suggestive of enhanced synchrony of auditory nerve fibers. This interpretation was supported by the greater excitability of CaBP1 KO than WT neurons in whole-cell patch clamp recordings of spiral ganglion neurons in culture, and normal presynaptic function of CaBP1 KO IHCs. DPOAEs and ABR thresholds were normal in 4-week old CaBP1 KO mice, but elevated ABR thresholds became evident at 32 kHz at 9 weeks, and at 8 and 16 kHz by 6 months of age. In contrast, CaBP2 KO mice exhibited significant ABR threshold elevations at 4 weeks of age that became more severe in the mid-frequency range by 9 weeks. Though normal at 4 weeks, DPOAEs in CaBP2 KO mice were significantly reduced in the mid-frequency range by 9 weeks. Our results reveal requirements for CaBP1 and CaBP2 in the peripheral auditory system and highlight the diverse modes by which CaBPs influence sensory processing."	"Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein 2 (CaBP2) inhibits the inactivation of heterologously expressed voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels of type 1.3 (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3) and is defective in human autosomal-recessive deafness 93 (DFNB93). Here, we report a newly identified mutation in <i>CABP2</i> that causes a moderate hearing impairment likely via nonsense-mediated decay of CABP2-mRNA. To study the mechanism of hearing impairment resulting from <i>CABP2</i> loss of function, we disrupted <i>Cabp2</i> in mice (<i>Cabp2</i><sup>                        <i>LacZ/LacZ</i>                    </sup> ). CaBP2 was expressed by cochlear hair cells, preferentially in inner hair cells (IHCs), and was lacking from the postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). <i>Cabp2</i><sup>                        <i>LacZ/LacZ</i>                    </sup> mice displayed intact cochlear amplification but impaired auditory brainstem responses. Patch-clamp recordings from <i>Cabp2</i><sup>                        <i>LacZ/LacZ</i>                    </sup> IHCs revealed enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel inactivation. The voltage dependence of activation and the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels appeared normal in <i>Cabp2</i><sup>                        <i>LacZ/LacZ</i>                    </sup> mice, as were ribbon synapse counts. Recordings from single SGNs showed reduced spontaneous and sound-evoked firing rates. We propose that CaBP2 inhibits Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel inactivation, and thus sustains the availability of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels for synaptic sound encoding. Therefore, we conclude that human deafness DFNB93 is an auditory synaptopathy."	"Calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) form a subfamily of calmodulin-like proteins that were cloned from the retina. CaBP4 and CaBP5 have been shown to be important for normal visual function. Although CaBP1/caldendrin and CaBP2 have been shown to modulate various targets <i>in vitro</i>, it is not known whether they contribute to the transmission of light responses through the retina. Therefore, we generated mice that lack CaBP2 or CaBP1/caldendrin (<i>Cabp2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Cabp1<sup>-/-</sup></i> ) to test whether these CaBPs are essential for normal retinal function. By immunohistochemistry, the overall morphology of <i>Cabp1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Cabp2<sup>-/-</sup></i> retinas and the number of synaptic ribbons appear normal; transmission electron microscopy shows normal tethered ribbon synapses and synaptic vesicles as in wild-type retinas. However, whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed that light responses of retinal ganglion cells of <i>Cabp2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Cabp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice differ in amplitude and kinetics from those of wild-type mice. We conclude that CaBP1/caldendrin and CaBP2 are not required for normal gross retinal and synapse morphology but are necessary for the proper transmission of light responses through the retina; like other CaBPs, CaBP1/caldendrin and CaBP2 likely act by modulating presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling mechanisms."	"To evaluate the contribution of eight small NSHL-AR (non-syndromic deafness, autosomal recessive) genes to hereditary hearing loss in Czech patients.Unrelated Czech patients, adults and children, diagnosed with pre-lingual hereditary hearing loss with at least one similarly affected deaf sibling and with previously excluded mutations in the GJB2 gene were investigated by Sanger sequencing of the selected eight small NSHL-AR associated genes (CABP2 - 51 patients, CIB2 - 45 patients, PJVK/DFNB59 - 53 patients, GJB3 - 46 patients, ILDR1 - 48 patients, LHFPL5 - 66 patients, LRTOMT - 60 patients, TMIE - 64 patients).Mutations were detected in the LHFPL5 (DFNB67) gene. The patient is heterozygote for two already described pathogenic variants (p.Tyr127Cys, p.Thr165Met). In five samples, five rare heterozygous variants (two novel) predicted as pathogenic were detected in genes CABP2, ILDR1, LHFPL5 and LRTOMT.Mutations in eight small NSHL-AR genes are not a frequent cause of hereditary hearing loss in the Czech Republic. This diagnostic approach permitted the clarification of HL in only one patient - two heterozygous mutations were detected in LHFPL5 gene for the first time in Central Europe. As the use of panel base MPS certainly improves the diagnostic yield, future studies should rather profit from that diagnostic strategy."	"CaBPs are a family of EF-hand Ca2+ binding proteins that are structurally similar to calmodulin. CaBPs can interact with, and yet differentially modulate, effectors that are regulated by calmodulin, such as Cav1 voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Immunolabeling studies suggest that multiple CaBP family members (CaBP1, 2, 4, and 5) are expressed in the cochlea. To gain insights into the respective auditory functions of these CaBPs, we characterized the expression and cellular localization of CaBPs in the mouse cochlea. By quantitative reverse transcription PCR, we show that CaBP1 and CaBP2 are the major CaBPs expressed in mouse cochlea both before and after hearing onset. Of the three alternatively spliced variants of CaBP1 (caldendrin, CaBP1-L, and CaBP1-S) and CaBP2 (CaBP2-alt, CaBP2-L, CaBP2-S), caldendrin and CaBP2-alt are the most abundant. By in situ hybridization, probes recognizing caldendrin strongly label the spiral ganglion, while probes designed to recognize all three isoforms of CaBP1 weakly label both the inner and outer hair cells as well as the spiral ganglion. Within the spiral ganglion, caldendrin/CaBP1 labeling is associated with cells resembling satellite glial cells. CaBP2-alt is strongly expressed in inner hair cells both before and after hearing onset. Probes designed to recognize all three variants of CaBP2 strongly label inner hair cells before hearing onset and outer hair cells after the onset of hearing. Thus, CaBP1 and CaBP2 may have overlapping roles in regulating Ca2+ signaling in the hair cells, and CaBP1 may have an additional function in the spiral ganglion. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the role of CaBP family members in the auditory periphery. "	"CaBPs are a family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins related to calmodulin and are localized in the brain and sensory organs, including the retina and cochlea. Although their physiological roles are not yet fully elucidated, CaBPs modulate Ca(2+) signaling through effectors such as voltage-gated Ca(v) Ca(2+) channels. In this study, we identified a splice-site mutation (c.637+1G&gt;T) in Ca(2+)-binding protein 2 (CABP2) in three consanguineous Iranian families affected by moderate-to-severe hearing loss. This mutation, most likely a founder mutation, probably leads to skipping of exon 6 and premature truncation of the protein (p.Phe164Serfs(∗)4). Compared with wild-type CaBP2, the truncated CaBP2 showed altered Ca(2+) binding in isothermal titration calorimetry and less potent regulation of Ca(v)1.3 Ca(2+) channels. We show that genetic defects in CABP2 cause moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing impairment. The mutation might cause a hypofunctional CaBP2 defective in Ca(2+) sensing and effector regulation in the inner ear."	"We previously reported that fructose force-feeding rapidly induces jejunal Slc2a5 gene expression in rats. In this study, we conducted microarray analyses using total RNA to identify genes upregulated in rat jejunum by fructose force-feeding. Rats were force-fed fructose, glucose or distilled water for 6h. Genes such as Slc2a5, Cdkn1c, Cabp2, Ranbp3, Vwce and Gcgr were induced by force-feeding with fructose compared with glucose or distilled water. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that trimethylation of histone H3K4, and acetylation of histones H3 and H4, on the transcribed region of these fructose-inducible genes were enhanced by force-feeding of fructose, but not glucose or distilled water. These results suggest that the induction of genes in the rat jejunum by fructose force-feeding is coordinately regulated by histone modifications, particularly trimethylation of histone H3K4."	"Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) are responsible for catalyzing the proper oxidation and isomerization of disulfide bonds of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER contains many different PDI-like proteins. Some, such as PDI, are general enzymes that directly recognize misfolded proteins while others, such as ERp57 and ERp72, have more specialized roles. Here, we report the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal portion of ERp72 (also known as CaBP2 or PDI A4), which contains two a(0)a catalytic thioredoxin-like domains. The structure shows that the a(0) domain contains an additional N-terminal beta-strand and a different conformation of the beta5-alpha4 loop relative to other thioredoxin-like domains. The structure of the a domain reveals that a conserved arginine residue inserts into the hydrophobic core and makes a salt bridge with a conserved glutamate residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site. A structural model of full-length ERp72 shows that all three catalytic sites roughly face each other and positions the adjacent hydrophobic patches that are likely involved in protein substrate binding."	"Protein disulfide isomerases are a family of proteins that catalyze the oxidation and isomerization of disulfide bonds in newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The family includes general enzymes such as PDI that recognize unfolded proteins, and others that are selective for specific classes of proteins. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of central non-catalytic domains of a specific isomerase, ERp72 (also called CaBP2 and protein disulfide-isomerase A4) from Rattus norvegicus. The structure reveals strong similarity to ERp57, a PDI-family member that interacts with the lectin-like chaperones calnexin and calreticulin but, unexpectedly, ERp72 does not interact with calnexin as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of ERp72 was used to develop models of the full-length protein using both rigid body refinement and ab initio simulated annealing of dummy atoms. The two methods show excellent agreement and define the relative positions of the five thioredoxin-like domains of ERp72 and potential substrate or chaperone binding sites."	"Sound coding at the auditory inner hair cell synapse requires graded changes in neurotransmitter release, triggered by sustained activation of presynaptic Ca(v)1.3 voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. Central to their role in this regard, Ca(v)1.3 channels in inner hair cells show little Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation, a fast negative feedback regulation by incoming Ca(2+) ions, which depends on calmodulin association with the Ca(2+) channel alpha(1) subunit. Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation characterizes nearly all voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels including Ca(v)1.3 in other excitable cells. The mechanism underlying the limited autoregulation of Ca(v)1.3 in inner hair cells remains a mystery. Previously, we established calmodulin-like Ca(2+)-binding proteins in the brain and retina (CaBPs) as essential modulators of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. Here, we demonstrate that CaBPs differentially modify Ca(2+) feedback to Ca(v)1.3 channels in transfected cells and explore their significance for Ca(v)1.3 regulation in inner hair cells. Of multiple CaBPs detected in inner hair cells (CaBP1, CaBP2, CaBP4 and CaBP5), CaBP1 most efficiently blunts Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of Ca(v)1.3. CaBP1 and CaBP4 both interact with calmodulin-binding sequences in Ca(v)1.3, but CaBP4 more weakly inhibits Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation than CaBP1. Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation is marginally greater in inner hair cells from CaBP4(-/-) than from wild-type mice, yet CaBP4(-/-) mice are not hearing-impaired. In contrast to CaBP4, CaBP1 is strongly localized at the presynaptic ribbon synapse of adult inner hair cells both in wild-type and CaBP4(-/-) mice and therefore is positioned to modulate native Ca(v)1.3 channels. Our results reveal unexpected diversity in the strengths of CaBPs as Ca(2+) channel modulators, and implicate CaBP1 rather than CaBP4 in conferring the anomalous slow inactivation of Ca(v)1.3 Ca(2+) currents required for auditory transmission."	"The rat luminal endoplasmic-recticulum calcium-binding proteins 1 and 2 (CaBP1 and CaBP2 respectively) are members of the protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI) family. They contain two and three thioredoxin boxes (Cys-Gly-His-Cys) respectively and, like PDI, may be involved in the folding of nascent proteins. We demonstrate here that CaBP1, similar to PDI and CaBP2, can complement the lethal phenotype of the disrupted Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDI gene, provided that the natural C-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu sequence is replaced by His-Asp-Glu-Leu. Both the in vitro RNase AIII-re-activation assays and in vivo pro-(carboxypeptidase Y) processing assays using CaBP1 and CaBP2 thioredoxin (trx)-box mutants revealed that, whereas the three trx boxes in CaBP2 seem to be functionally equivalent, the first trx box of CaBP1 is significantly more active than the second trx box. Furthermore, only about 65% re-activation of denatured reduced RNase AIII could be obtained with CaBP1 or CaBP2 compared with PDI, and the yield of PDI-catalysed reactions was significantly reduced in the presence of either CaBP1 or CaBP2. In contrast with PDI, neither CaBP1 nor CaBP2 could catalyse the renaturation of denatured glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is a redox-independent process, and neither protein had any effect on the PDI-catalysed refolding of GAPDH. Furthermore, although PDI can bind peptides via its b' domain, a property it shares with PDIp, the pancreas-specific PDI homologue, and although PDI can bind malfolded proteins such as 'scrambled' ribonuclease, no such interactions could be detected for CaBP2. We conclude that: (1) both CaBP2 and CaBP1 lack peptide-binding activity for GAPDH attributed to the C-terminal region of the a' domain of PDI; (2) CaBP2 lacks the general peptide-binding activity attributed to the b' domain of PDI; (3) interaction of CaBP2 with substrate (RNase AIII) is different from that of PDI and substrate; and (4) both CaBP2 and CaBP1 may promote oxidative folding by different kinetic pathways."	"Five members of a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein subfamily (CaBP), with 46-58% sequence similarity to calmodulin (CaM), were identified in the vertebrate retina. Important differences between these Ca(2+)-binding proteins and CaM include alterations within their second EF-hand loop that render these motifs inactive in Ca(2+) coordination and the fact that their central alpha-helixes are extended by one alpha-helical turn. CaBP1 and CaBP2 contain a consensus sequence for N-terminal myristoylation, similar to members of the recoverin subfamily and are fatty acid acylated in vitro. The patterns of expression differ for each of the various members. Expression of CaBP5, for example, is restricted to retinal rod and cone bipolar cells. In contrast, CaBP1 has a more widespread pattern of expression. In the brain, CaBP1 is found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in the retina this protein is found in cone bipolar and amacrine cells. CaBP1 and CaBP2 are expressed as multiple, alternatively spliced variants, and in heterologous expression systems these forms show different patterns of subcellular localization. In reconstitution assays, CaBPs are able to substitute functionally for CaM. These data suggest that these novel CaBPs are an important component of Ca(2+)-mediated cellular signal transduction in the central nervous system where they may augment or substitute for CaM."	"Previous studies identified a group of proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that bind calcium and direct protein folding. Three of these proteins, CaBP1, CaBP2, and protein disulfide isomerase, have been purified from rat microsomes and analyzed biochemically. However, their function in vivo has not been determined. Here, we report the isolation of a homologue of the CaBP1 gene from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster (DmCaBP1). The predicted sequence of the Drosophila protein is very similar to that of rat CaBP1 and retains motifs thought to be functionally important in the mammalian protein. We show that DmCaBP1 is expressed in a specific spatiotemporal pattern during embryogenesis. In particular, it is expressed in midline precursor cells in the developing CNS. This is the first demonstration of tissue-specific expression for a member of this group of ER proteins and suggests a possible role for DmCABP1 as a molecular chaperone involved in nervous system development. The identification of the DmCaBP1 gene provides a basis for future genetic studies of its function."	"The ER retention of lumenal proteins is achieved by a process which involves binding of escaped proteins via the C-terminal KDEL-tags to a KDEL receptor (erd2 receptor) in a post-ER compartment and return of the protein-receptor complex back to the ER. The transmembrane topology of the human KDEL receptor, which is an integral membrane protein, has been proposed. We have synthesised sets of cellulose-bound overlapping peptides covering the complete se quence of the receptor to study the interaction of the erd2 receptor with lumenal ER proteins, CaBP1 and CaBP2. At the next stage, the proposed lumenal loops of the receptor were more closely mapped. A short sequence, essential for the protein binding to the most efficient binding site of the receptor, was identified as 22KIWK25, which is in accordance with one of the proposed structural models of the receptor. The binding was of high specificity and was almost completely inhibited by KDEL-containing soluble peptides. The phosphorylation state of CaBP1/CaBP2 did not affect their binding to the KDEL receptor."	"The activity of BiP, the major chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, is known to be Ca2+-regulated; however, the participation of this protein in the ER storage of the cation has not yet been investigated. Here such a role is demonstrated in human epithelial (HeLa) cells transiently transfected with the hamster BiP cDNA and incubated in Ca2+-free medium, as revealed by two different techniques. In the first, co-transfected aequorin was employed as a probe for assaying either the cytosolic of the mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration. By this approach higher Ca2+ release responses were revealed in BiP-transfected cells by experiments in which extensive store depletion was induced either by repetitive stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists or by treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. In the second technique the cells were loaded at the equilibrium with 45Ca, and the release of the tracer observed upon treatment with thapsigargin, a blocker of the ER Ca2+ ATPases, was larger in BiP-transfected than in control cells. The latter results were obtained also when BiP was overexpressed not via transfection but as a response to ER stress by tunicamycin. These results are sustained by increases of the ER Ca2+ storage capacity rather than by artifacts or indirect readjustments induced in the cells by the overexpression of the chaperone since (a) the exogenous and endogenous BiP were both confined to the ER, (b) the expression levels of other proteins active in the ER Ca2+ storage were not changed, and (c) effects similar to those of wild type BiP were obtained with a deletion mutant devoid of chaperone activity. The specificity of the results was confirmed by parallel 45Ca experiments carried out in HeLa cells transfected with two other Ca2+-binding proteins, calreticulin and CaBP2(ERp72), only the first of which induced increases of Ca2+ capacity. We conclude that BiP has a dual function, in addition to its chaperone role it is a bona fide ER lumenal Ca2+ storage protein contributing, under resting cell conditions, to around 25% of the store, with a stoichiometry of 1-2 moles of calcium/mole of BiP."	"Several proteins in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum are substrates for protein kinases. Many unidentified phosphoproteins from this compartment are described in the literature, and this prompted us to try to identify at least the more dominant ones. When solubilized bovine and murine microsomes were phosphorylated with protein kinase CK2 and [32P]ATP and separated on SDS-PAGE, the corresponding autoradiogram showed three dominant 32P-labeled proteins. These three [32P]phosphoproteins were identified as calcium-binding proteins (CaBP) 1, 2, and 4 after purification on a MonoQ column followed by SDS-PAGE, proteolytic cleavage and subsequent amino acid sequencing of the purified 32P-labeled peptides. All three were also phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase, found by us to be of the CK2 type. This kinase phosphorylated CaBP1 N-terminally at serine 427. Of the three proteins, only CaBP4 was previously known to be a substrate of CK2. The newly identified substrates CaBP 1 and 2 are members of the thioredoxin family and have a signal tetrapeptide in the C-terminal of the protein for retention in the ER. Serines and/or threonines in the C-terminal were phosphorylated in CaBP1 when the endogenous CK2 was used as protein kinase. A protein with the same molecular mass as CaBP1 on SDS-PAGE was phosphorylated when intact hepatocytes were grown in the presence of [32P] phosphate. The in vitro phosphorylation with protein kinase CK2 can be used as a specific and sensitive method for identification of CaBP1, 2, and 4 in microsomes."	"Protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) is the best known representative of a growing family of enzymes with thioredoxin domains. Two such proteins with thioredoxin (Trx) domains, CaBP1 and CaBP2 (ERp72), have previously been isolated from rat liver microsomes. Here we report that they, like PDI are substrates for thioredoxin reductase and will catalyze NADPH-dependent insulin disulfide reduction. The activity of CaBP1 and CaBP2 in this assay was higher than that of PDI but lower than that of E. coli Trx. Furthermore, as isolated the thioredoxin domains of CaBP1 and CaBP2 were in disulfide form as judged by stoichiometric oxidation of 2 and 3 mol of NADPH in CaBP1 and CaBP2, respectively. The redox potential of the active site disulfide/dithiol was estimated from the equilibrium with a mutant E. coli Trx, P34H Trx, with a known redox potential (-235 mV). This showed that CaBP1 and CaBP2, like PDI, have a much higher redox potential than wild type thioredoxin (-270 mV) in agreement with a role in formation of protein disulfide bonds. In conclusion, in vitro CaBP1 and CaBP2 share catalytic properties in thiol disulfide-interchange reactions with PDI. Thus, the well known activity of PDI is not unique in the endoplasmic reticulum and CaBP1 and CaBP2 may be regarded as functional equivalents."
"CDH23"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"<b>Objective:</b> To explore the relationship among CDH23 gene variation and the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) . <b>Methods:</b> The nested case-control study was performed and this study followed a cohort of 6297 noise-exposed workers in a steel factory of Henan province in China from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2015. In July 2019, subjects whose average hearing threshold were more than 40 dB in high frequency were defined as the case group, and subjects whose average hearing threshold were less than 35 dB in high frequency and less than 25 dB in speech frequency were defined as the control group. A nested case-control study which included 572 subjects was carried out, in which subjects consisted of 286 cases and 286 controls. 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CDH23 were selected and genotyped, then we analyzed the association among SNPs in CDH23, haplotypes in CDH23 and NIHL risk. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the main effects of SNPs and the interactions between CNE and SNPs adjusting cumulative noise exposure (CNE) , smoking, drinking, physical exercise and hypertension. Moreover, the association between haplotypes in CDH23 and NIHL risk were also analyzed. We ananlyzed the relationship amongst different SNP groups and NIHL risk using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method. <b>Results:</b> The results suggested that significant associations were observed for rs3802711, rs3752751, rs3752752, rs11592462, rs10762480, rs3747867 for NIHL overall and/or various CNE strata by adjusting CNE, smoking, drinking, physical exercise and blood pressure. For rs3802711, workers exposure to noise carrying the AA/GA genotype of rs3802711 increased risk of NIHL than those carrying GG genotype (<i>OR</i>=3.121; 95%<i>CI</i>:1.054-9.239, <i>P</i>=0.035) in overall; In the stratified analysis of CNE (&gt;97 dB (A) ·year at rs3802711 locus, workers exposure to noise carrying GA genotype (<i>OR</i>=2.056; 95%<i>CI</i>:1.226~3.448, <i>P</i>=0.006) and GA+AA/GA genotype (<i>OR</i>=2.221; 95%<i>CI</i>:1.340~3.681, <i>P</i>=0.002) increased NIHL risk. For rs11592462, workers exposure to noise carrying the GG genotype of rs11592462 increased risk of NIHL than those carrying CC genotype in overall (<i>OR</i>=3.951; 95%<i>CI</i>:1.104-14.137, <i>P</i>=0.04) ; workers exposure to noise carrying the GG genotype of rs11592462 increased risk of NIHL than those carrying CG+CC genotype in overall (<i>OR</i>=4.06; 95%<i>CI</i>:1.145-14.391, <i>P</i>=0.03) . After adjusting CNE, smoking, drinking, physical exercise and blood pressure, the haplotypes of CDH23 rs1227049, rs10999947, rs3752752, rs3752751, rs10762480, rs3802711, rs11592462, rs10466026, rs4747194, rs4747195 were not associated with the risk of NIHL. GMDR analysis showed no association between SNP combination and NIHL risk after adjusting CNE, smoking, drinking, physical exercise and blood pressure. <b>Conclusion:</b> Gene polymorphisms in CDH23 might associate significantly with the risk of NIHL."	"<b>目的：</b> 探讨CDH23基因多态性与噪声性听力损失（noise-induced hearing loss，NIHL）发生风险的关系。 <b>方法：</b> 从2006年1月1日起，以河南省某钢铁企业的6 297名接触噪声作业工人为队列研究人群，随访至2015年12月31日。于2019年7月，以1:1巢式病例对照研究方法在队列研究对象中按照年龄、接噪工龄、性别、工种因素选择双耳高频（3 000、4 000、6 000 Hz）平均听阈≥40 dB者选为听力损失组，选择双耳高频平均听阈&lt;35 dB任一耳语频的任一频段（500、1 000、2 000 Hz）听阈均≤25 dB者为对照组，两组研究对象各286例。对调查对象进行一般体格检查和问卷调查，进行纯音听力测试和作业现场噪声测量，采用中高通量单核苷酸多态性分型检测技术（SNPscanTM法）对研究对象的CDH23基因18个位点进行检测。并采用条件Logistic回归分析不同单核苷酸多态性（single nucleotide polymorphism，SNP）与NIHL的关系，及调整协变量后不同多态位点与NIHL发生风险的关系；以不同累积噪声暴露量（cumulative noise exposure，CNE）分层后，采用条件logistic回归对不同位点与NIHL发生风险关系进行分析。采用广义多因子降维法（generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction，GMDR）分析不同SNP组合与NIHL发生风险的关系。 <b>结果：</b> 与对照组比较，听力损失组在年龄、接噪工龄、CNE、饮酒习惯、高血压患病情况和体育锻炼情况的分布差异均无统计学意义（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）；听力损失组研究对象吸烟人数多，听力损失组双耳高频平均听阈位移高，差异有统计学意义（<i>P</i>&lt;0.01）。在调整了CNE、吸烟、饮酒、体育锻炼、高血压混杂因素的条件下，分析结果显示CDH23基因rs3802711、rs3752751、rs3752752、rs11592462、rs10762480、rs3747867多态位点在总体或CNE分层分析结果与NIHL发生风险均有关（<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）。rs3802711位点总体分析结果和CNE≥97 dB（A）·年分层分析结果均显示，与携带GG基因型的噪声作业工人比较，携带AA/GA或GA+AA基因型的噪声作业工人更易发生NIHL（<i>OR</i>=3.121，95<i>CI</i>%:1.054~9.239，<i>P</i>=0.04；<i>OR</i>=2.056，95<i>CI</i>%: 1.226~3.448，<i>P</i>=0.006；<i>OR</i>=2.221，95<i>CI</i>%: 1.340~3.681，<i>P</i>=0.002）；rs11592462位点总体分析结果中，与携带CC基因型或CG+CC基因型的噪声作业工人比较，携带GG基因型的噪声作业工人更易发生NIHL（<i>OR</i>=3.951，95<i>CI</i>%:1.104~14.137，<i>P</i>=0.035；<i>OR</i>=4.060，95<i>CI</i>%: 1.145~14.391，<i>P</i>=0.030）。在调整了CNE、吸烟、饮酒、体育锻炼、高血压混杂因素的条件下，CDH23 rs1227049、rs10999947、rs3752752、rs3752751、rs10762480、rs3802711、rs11592462、rs10466026、rs4747194、rs4747195位点在构成的单体型与NIHL发生风险均无关联（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）。本研究在调整了CNE、吸烟、饮酒、高血压和体育锻炼因素后GMDR分析结果均未见SNP组合与NIHL发生风险有关联（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）。 <b>结论：</b> CDH23基因位点变异可能与NIHL的发生风险有关。.Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most aggressive human cancers due to its high invasiveness. Germline mutations in high-risk melanoma susceptibility genes have been associated with development hereditary melanoma; however, most genetic culprits remain elusive. To unravel novel susceptibility genes for hereditary melanoma, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on eight patients with multiple primary melanomas, high number of nevi, and negative for high and intermediate-risk germline mutations. Thirteen new potentially pathogenic variants were identified after bioinformatics analysis and validation. <i>CDH23</i>, <i>ARHGEF40,</i> and <i>BRD9</i> were identified as the most promising susceptibility genes in hereditary melanoma. <i>In silico</i> analysis of CDH23 and ARHGEF40 variants provided clues for altered protein structure and function associated with the identified mutations. Then, we also evaluated the clinical value of <i>CDH23</i>, <i>ARHGEF40,</i> and <i>BRD9</i> expression in sporadic melanoma by using the TCGA dataset (<i>n</i> = 461). No differences were observed in <i>BRD9</i> expression between melanoma and normal skin samples, nor with melanoma stage, whereas <i>ARHGEF40</i> was found overexpressed, and <i>CDH23</i> was downregulated and its loss was associated with worse survival. Altogether, these results reveal three novel genes with clinical relevance in hereditary and sporadic melanoma."	"This study aimed to investigate the association between candidate genetic variants and audiometric measures of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in young musicians.The study analyzed a database by Phillips et al. (Feasibility of a bilateral 4000-6000 Hz notch as a phenotype for genetic association analysis. Int J Audiol 2015;54:645-52.) which included behavioral hearing thresholds, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), tympanometric, and genetic data of 166 participants meeting the inclusion criteria. Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13 cochlear genes previously associated with NIHL in factory workers were included in the present investigation. The average hearing threshold at 3000 and 4000 Hz (AHT) and average DPOAE signal to noise ratio (DPOAE SNR) in both ears were calculated.The regression analyses showed that two SNPs- one in KCNE1 (rs2070358) and the other in CAT (rs12273124) revealed a statistically significant relationship with DPOAE SNR in both ears. Two SNPs in MYH14 and one in GJB4 revealed a significant association with DPOAE SNR in the left ear. Two SNPs in HSP70, one in CDH23 and one in KCNJ10 showed significant association with DPOAE SNR in the right ear. None of the included SNPs showed association with AHT in both ears.A genetic variant in KCNE1 was associated with the strength of the cochlear amplifier as assessed by DPOAE SNR. Musicians carrying causal genetic variants to NIHL might exhibit changes in their auditory functions early in the lifespan even when most subjects had their hearing thresholds within normal limits. These participants are likely to show the clinical manifestation of NIHL in the future if no preventive measures are applied."	"<b>Background:</b> Recent advances in less-invasive surgery and electrode design allow for a high degree of hearing preservation (HP) after cochlear implantation (CI), although residual hearing still deteriorates in some patients. To date, the factors predictive of preserving residual hearing remain a controversial topic.<b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive factors, including the etiology of hearing loss (HL) as a patient-related factor, influencing residual HP after CI.<b>Methods:</b> Forty-four patients (50 ears, 41 families) with residual acoustic hearing who underwent CI were included. Auditory thresholds before and at 6 months after initial activation were measured. Genetic testing was performed to identify the responsible genes for HL.<b>Results:</b> We identified the cause of HL in 21 families (51.2%). HP was marginally correlated with age at implantation, while it was independent of pre-operative low-frequency hearing thresholds, cochlear duct length, and electrode length. We found that patients who had pathogenic variants in the <i>CDH23</i>, <i>MYO7A</i>, or <i>MYO15A</i> gene showed statistically better HP scores compared with patients with HL due to other causes (<i>p</i> = .002).<b>Conclusions:</b> Identification of the etiology of HL using genetic testing is likely to facilitate the prediction of HP after implant surgery."	"Hereditary hearing loss is a heterogeneous group of complex disorders with an overall incidence of one in every 500 newborns presented as syndromic and non-syndromic forms. Cadherin-related 23 (CDH23) is one of the listed deafness causative genes. It is found to be expressed in the stereocilia of hair cells and in the retina photoreceptor cells. Defective CDH23 have been associated mostly with prelingual severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in either syndromic (USH1D) or non-syndromic SNHL (DFNB12) deafness. The purpose of this study was to identify causative mutations in an Omani family diagnosed with severe-profound sensorineural hearing loss by whole exome sequencing technique and analyzing the detected variant in silico for pathogenicity using several in silico mutation prediction software.A novel homozygous missense variant, c.A7436C (p. D2479A), in exon 53 of CDH23 was detected in the family while the control samples were all negative for the detected variant. In silico mutation prediction analysis showed the novel substituted D2479A to be deleterious and protein destabilizing mutation at a conserved site on CDH23 protein.In silico mutation prediction analysis might be used as a useful molecular diagnostic tool benefiting both genetic counseling and mutation verification. The aspartic acid 2479 alanine missense substitution might be the main disease-causing mutation that damages CDH23 function and could be used as a genetic hearing loss marker for this particular Omani family."	"C57BL/6J mice have long been studied as a model of age-related hearing loss (ARHL). In C57BL/6J mice, ARHL begins in the high-frequency range at 3 months of age and spreads toward low frequencies by 10 months of age. We previously confirmed that c.753A&gt;G genome editing of an ahl allele (c.753A) in the cadherin 23 gene (Cdh23) suppressed the onset of ARHL until 12 months of age. We further investigated the hearing phenotypes of the original and genome-edited C57BL/6J-Cdh23<sup>+/+</sup> (c.753G/G) mice until 24 months of age. The hearing tests revealed that most of the C57BL/6J mice maintained good hearing levels until 14 months of age following genome editing of a Cdh23<sup>ahl</sup> allele. However, the hearing levels of the C57BL/6J-Cdh23<sup>+/+</sup> mice gradually declined, and severe ARHL developed with increasing age. ARHL in the C57BL/6J mice was correlated with degeneration of the stereocilia in cochlear hair cells. The stereocilia degeneration was rescued in the C57BL/6J-Cdh23<sup>+/+</sup> mice at 12 months of age, but the stereocilia bundles exhibited abnormal phenotypes similar to those of the original C57BL/6J mice at more advanced ages. Therefore, genome editing of Cdh23<sup>ahl</sup> did not completely suppress ARHL in C57BL/6J mice. We also compared the hearing levels of C57BL/6J-Cdh23<sup>+/+</sup> mice with those of C3H/HeN and MSM/Ms mice, which carry the Cdh23<sup>+</sup> allele. The severity and onset patterns of ARHL in the C57BL/6J-Cdh23<sup>+/+</sup> mice differed from those observed in other Cdh23<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that other susceptible and/or resistant alleles of ARHL exist in the genetic backgrounds of these mice."	"To describe the complex, overlapping phenotype of four Chinese patients with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) who harbored two pathogenic genes simultaneously.This retrospective study included 4 patients affected with IRDs. Medical and ophthalmic histories were obtained, and clinical examinations were performed. A specific Hereditary Eye Disease Enrichment Panel (HEDEP) based on exome capture technology was used for genetic screening.Four patients were identified to harbor disease-causing variants in two different genes. Patient retinitis pigmentosa (RP) 01-II:1 exhibited both classical <i>ABCA4</i>-induced Stargardt disease (STGD) 1 and <i>USH2A</i>-associated RP, patient RP02-III:2 exhibited both classical <i>ABCA4</i>-induced STGD1 and <i>CDH23</i>-associated RP, patient RP03-II:1 exhibited both <i>USH2A</i>-induced autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) syndrome and <i>SNRNP200</i>-induced autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), and patient RP04-II:2 exhibited <i>USH2A</i>-induced arRP syndrome and <i>EYS</i>-induced arRP at the same time.Our study demonstrates that genotype-phenotype correlations and comprehensive genetic screening is crucial for diagnosing IRDs and helping family planning for patients suffering from the disease."	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. In this study, we characterized the clinical features of 12 Chinese Han deaf families in which mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1 were excluded.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 147 known deafness genes was performed in probands of 10 families, while whole-exome sequencing was applied in those of the rest two.Pathogenic mutations in a total of 11 rare deafness genes, OTOF, CDH23, PCDH15, PDZD7, ADGRV1, KARS, OTOG, GRXCR2, MYO6, GRHL2, and POU3F4, were identified in all 12 probands, with 16 mutations being novel. Intrafamilial cosegregation of the mutations and the deafness phenotype were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Our results expanded the mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation of nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese Hans and also emphasized the importance of combining both next-generation sequencing and detailed auditory evaluation to achieve a more accurate diagnosis for nonsyndromic hearing loss."	"Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two <i>lhfpl5</i> genes (<i>lhfpl5a</i> and <i>lhfpl5b</i>), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed. Here we show that the zebrafish <i>lhfpl5</i> genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: <i>lhfpl5a</i> expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while <i>lhfpl5b</i> expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, <i>lhfpl5a</i> mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of <i>lhfpl5b</i> affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both <i>lhfpl5a</i> and <i>lhfpl5b</i> mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins."	"Recessive mutations in GJB2 is the most common cause of genetic hearing loss worldwide. The aim of this study is to determine the spectrum and frequency of GJB2 variants in Chinese Han deaf patients and to investigate the underlying causative genes in patients with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.We analyzed the mutation screening results of GJB2 in 1852 Chinese Han probands with apparently autosomal-recessive hearing loss in our laboratory. Targeted next-generation sequencing of 139 known deafness-related genes were performed in 44 probands with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.Bi-allelic GJB2 mutations was identified in 25.65% of patients, in which the c.235delC (p.L79Cfs*3) mutation is the most frequent cause for both severe-to-profound (84.93%) and mild-to-moderate hearing loss (54.05%), while the c.109G &gt; A (p.V37I) mutation is another frequent cause for mild-to-moderate hearing loss (40.54%). In 3.89% of patients only one mutant allele can be identified in GJB2. Targeted next generation sequencing in 44 such probands revealed digenic heterozygous mutations in GJB2/GJB6 and GJB2/GJB3 as the likely pathogenic mechanism in three probands. In 13 probands, on the other hand, pathogenic mutations in other deafness-associated genes (STRC, EYA1, MITF, PCDH15, USH2A, MYO15A, CDH23, OTOF, SLC26A4, SMPX, and TIMM8A) can be identified as the independent genetic cause, suggesting that the mono-allelic GJB2 mutations in those probands is likely co-incidental.Our results demonstrated that GJB2 should be a primary target for mutation screening in Chinese Han deaf patients, and those with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations should be further screened by next generation sequencing."	"The development of knockin mice with Cre recombinase expressed under the control of the promoter for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) has allowed experimental manipulation of cholinergic circuits. However, currently available ChAT<sup>Cre</sup> mouse lines are on the C57BL/6J strain background, which shows early onset age-related hearing loss attributed to the Cdh23<sup>753A</sup> mutation (a.k.a., the ahl mutation). To develop ChAT<sup>Cre</sup> mice without accelerated hearing loss, we backcrossed ChAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice with CBA/CaJ mice that have normal hearing. We used genotyping to obtain mice homozygous for ChAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup> and the wild-type allele at the Cdh23 locus (ChAT<sup>Cre,Cdh23WT</sup>). In the new line, auditory brainstem response thresholds were ∼20 dB lower than those in 9 month old ChAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice at all frequencies tested (4-31.5 kHz). These thresholds were stable throughout the period of testing (3-12 months of age). We then bred ChAT<sup>Cre,Cdh23WT</sup> animals with Ai14 reporter mice to confirm the expression pattern of ChAT<sup>Cre</sup>. In these mice, tdTomato-labeled cells were observed in all brainstem regions known to contain cholinergic cells. We then stained the tissue with a neuron-specific marker, NeuN, to determine whether Cre expression was limited to neurons. Across several brainstem nuclei (pontomesencephalic tegmentum, motor trigeminal and facial nuclei), 100% of the tdTomato-labeled cells were double-labeled with anti-NeuN (n = 1896 cells), indicating Cre-recombinase was limited to neurons. Almost all of these cells (1867/1896 = 98.5%) also stained with antibodies against ChAT, indicating that reporter label was expressed almost exclusively in cholinergic neurons. Finally, an average 88.7% of the ChAT+ cells in these nuclei were labeled with tdTomato, indicating that the Cre is expressed in a large proportion of the cholinergic cells in these nuclei. We conclude that the backcrossed ChAT<sup>Cre,Cdh23WT</sup> mouse line has normal hearing and expresses Cre recombinase almost exclusively in cholinergic neurons. This ChAT<sup>Cre,Cdh23WT</sup> mouse line may provide an opportunity to manipulate cholinergic circuits without the confound of accelerated hearing loss associated with the C57BL/6J background. Furthermore, comparison with lines that do show early hearing loss may provide insight into possible cholinergic roles in age-related hearing loss."	"Pathogenic variants of <i>USH1C</i>, encoding a PDZ-domain-containing protein called harmonin, have been known to cause autosomal recessive syndromic or nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). We identified a causative gene in a large Korean family with NSHL showing a typical pattern of autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance.Exome sequencing was performed for five affected and three unaffected individuals in this family. Following identification of a candidate gene variant, segregation analysis and functional studies, including circular dichroism and biolayer interferometry experiments, were performed.A novel <i>USH1C</i> heterozygous missense variant (c.667G&gt;T;p.Gly223Cys) was shown to segregate with the NSHL phenotype in this family. This variant affects an amino acid residue located in the highly conserved carboxylate-binding loop of the harmonin PDZ2 domain and is predicted to disturb the interaction with cadherin-related 23 (cdh23). The affinity of the variant PDZ2 domain for a biotinylated synthetic peptide containing the PDZ-binding motif of cdh23 was approximately 16-fold lower than that of the wild-type PDZ2 domain and that this inaccessibility of the binding site was caused by a conformational change in the variant PDZ2 domain.A heterozygous variant of <i>USH1C</i> that interferes with the interaction between cdh23 and harmonin causes novel AD-NSHL."	"Diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss (HHL) as a heterogeneous disorder is very important especially in countries with high rates of consanguinity where the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance is prevalent. Techniques such as next-generation sequencing, a comprehensive genetic test using targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE + MPS), have made the diagnosis more cost-effective. The aim of this study was to determine HHL variants with comprehensive genetic testing in our country.Fifty <i>GJB2</i> negative individuals with HHL were referred to the Kariminejad-Najmabadi Pathology and Genetics Center, Tehran, one of the reference diagnostic genetic laboratories in Iran, during a 3-year period between 2014 and 2017. They were screened with the OtoSCOPE test, the targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE + MPS) platform after a detailed history had been taken along with clinical evaluation.Among 32 out of 50 <i>GJB2</i> negative patients (64%), 34 known pathogenic and novel variants were detected of which 16 (47%) were novel, identified in 10 genes of which the most prevalent were <i>CDH23, MYO7A</i> and <i>MYO15A.</i>These results provide a foundation from which to make appropriate recommendations for the use of comprehensive genetic testing in the evaluation of Iranian patients with hereditary hearing loss."	"<b>Introduction</b>: This review explores insights provided by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of pituitary tumors and the clinical implications.<b>Areas covered</b>: Although syndromic forms account for just 5% of pituitary tumours, past Sanger sequencing studies pragmatically focused on them. These studies identified mutations in <i>MEN1, CDKN1B, PRKAR1A, GNAS</i> and <i>SDHx</i> causing Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia-1 (MEN1), MEN4, Carney Complex-1, McCune Albright Syndrome and 3P association syndromes, respectively. Furthermore, linkage analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified <i>AIP</i> mutations in 20% with familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA). NGS has enabled further investigation of sporadic tumours. Thus, mutations of <i>USP8</i> and <i>CABLES1</i> were identified in corticotrophinomas, <i>BRAF</i> in papillary craniopharyngiomas and <i>CTNNB1</i> in adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas. NGS also revealed that pituitary tumours occur in the DICER1 syndrome, due to <i>DICER1</i> mutations, and <i>CDH23</i> mutations occur in FIPA. These discoveries revealed novel therapeutic targets and studies are underway of <i>BRAF</i> inhibitors for papillary craniopharyngiomas, and EGFR and USP8 inhibitors for corticotrophinomas.<b>Expert opinion</b>: It has become apparent that single-nucleotide variants and small insertion/deletion DNA mutations cannot explain all pituitary tumorigenesis. Integrated and improved analyses including whole-genome sequencing, copy number, and structural variation analyses, RNA sequencing and epigenomic analyses, with improved genomic technologies, are likely to further define the genomic landscape."	"<b>Background</b>: Gene editing has shown huge potential in correcting aberrant splicing and Cas13 has been identified as being particularly suitable for targeting RNA. It has therefore become increasingly important to highlight new splice site mutations that may be correctable, particularly in genes that are too large to be encoded by AAV vectors. About 20% of Usher Type 1 cases are caused by mutations in <i>CDH23</i>.<b>Purpose</b>: To report a novel splice site mutation of <i>CDH23</i> associated with Usher Type 1D.<b>Materials and Methods</b>: Case report.<b>Results</b>: A 35-year-old Caucasian female who is congenitally deaf with vestibular dysfunction presented with visual acuity of 6/12 in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed findings typical of retinitis pigmentosa with foveal preservation of photoreceptor layer. Next generation sequencing analysis revealed a novel homozygous variant, c.9319 + 1G&gt;T in <i>CDH23</i> consistent with the diagnosis of Usher Syndrome Type 1D. The c.9319 + 1G&gt;T variant is predicted to affect splicing at the exon 65/intron 65 boundary, which highly likely leads to complete skipping of exon 65.<b>Conclusions</b>: We describe a case of a typical Usher Syndrome Type 1D caused by a novel splice site variant in <i>CDH23</i>. Currently there are no treatments for <i>CDH23</i> related retinal degeneration, partly because the cDNA size of 10kb is too large for AAV vector gene augmentation therapy. Alternative strategies include CRISPR-Cas9 adenine base editors and RNA editing with CRISPR-Cas13. Single-nucleotide editing represents a promising approach for targeting this variant in <i>CDH23</i> to restore the wildtype splice donor site at this position."	"To link congenital hearing loss with known loci to establish a platform for future research.The cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2016 to March 2017 in Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and comprised families with Pashtun ethnicity having at least 2 individuals suffering from congenital hearing loss. Deoxyribonucleic acid from whole blood samples was extracted by salting-out method. Amplification was done through touchdown polymerase chain reaction to see any possible linkage to already reported deafness loci. Linkage analysis was carried out using microsatellite markers for each locus. Genotyping of the samples was done and haplotypes were accordingly generated to either include or exclude the linked / unlinked regions.Of the 4 families, family PKDF 1620 showed linkage with DFNB12/CDH23 (D10S1432, D10S606, and D10S1694) and family PKDF 1625 had linkage with DFNB3/MYO15A (D17S2196, D17S2207 and D17S2206). Families PKDF1623 and PKDF1624 showed no linkage with any of the prevalent reported loci in Pakistan .Linkage to DFNB12 and MYO 15 showed heterogeneity of congenital deafness."	"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNL) is the most prevalent sensory deficit in our environment. Next generation genomic sequencing (NGS) enables an aetiological diagnosis in a high percentage of patients. Our pilot study shows the results of the systematic application of NGS in a Childhood Hearing Loss Unit, as well as its implications for the clinical management of patients and their families.We included 27 patients diagnosed with SNL between 2014 and 2017, in which an environmental cause was ruled out. The genetic test consisted of a panel of genes analyzed by NGS (OTOgenicsTM panel). This panel has been designed to include genes associated with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss, early onset or late, syndromic and non-syndromic, regardless of their inheritance pattern.A genetic diagnosis was obtained in 56% (15/27) of the patients (62% in the case of bilateral SNL). Of the patients, 5/27 (19%) presented pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene and the rest pathogenic and / or probably pathogenic variants in other genes associated with isolated SNL (PR2X2, TECTA and STRC), with syndromic SNL (CHD7, GATA3, COL4A5, MITF and SOX10) or with syndromic and non-syndromic SNL (BSND, ACTG1 and CDH23).The aetiological diagnosis of SNL is a challenge in clinical practice. Our series demonstrates that it is possible to implement genetic diagnosis in the care routine and that this information has prognostic and therapeutic implications."	"Genetic variations associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) may affect the structural aspects of neural networks mediated by the molecular pathways involved in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. However, few studies have applied a novel approach such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis to investigate the genetic contribution to the neurostructural changes in MDD.In the first part of the study, we investigated rare variants of selected genes from previous WES studies using a WES analysis in 184 patients with MDD and 82 healthy controls. In the second part of the study, we explored the association between the common genetic variants from the WES analysis and cortical thickness in 91 patients with MDD and 75 healthy controls. The gray-matter thickness of each cortical region was measured using FreeSurfer.We identified recurrent non-silent variants in 24 MDD-related genes including FASN, MYH13, UNC13D, LILRA1, CACNA1B, TRIO, HOMER3, and BCAR3, and observed eleven recurrently altered copy number alternations where a gain on 15q11.2 and losses on 7q34 and 15q11.1-q11.2 in MDD genomes. We also found that rs11592462 in CDH23, a calcium-dependent cell-adhesion molecule encoding gene, was significantly associated with thinning in the right anterior cingulate cortex.The small sample size may lead our findings to be underpowered regarding rare variants.The present study identified that non-synonymous rare variants were significantly associated with risk of MDD and found that genetic contributions to the development of MDD may be mediated by alterations in cortical thickness of emotion-processing neural circuits."	"Despite recent advances in genome engineering technologies, traditional transgenic mice generated on a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6 and 129/Sv mice remain widely used in age-related hearing loss (AHL) research, since C57BL/6 mice exhibit early onset and progression of AHL due to a mutation in cadherin 23-encoding gene (Cdh23<sup>753G&gt;A</sup>). In these transgenic mice, backcrossing for more than 10 generations results in replacement of the donor background (129/Sv) with that of the recipient (C57BL/6), so that approximately 99.9% of genes are C57BL/6-derived and are considered congenic. However, the regions flanking the target gene may still be of 129/Sv origin, creating a so-called &quot;passenger gene problem&quot; where the normal 129/Sv-derived Cdh23<sup>753G</sup> allele can travel with the target gene. In this study, we investigated the role of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (Fabp7), which is important for cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids in the cochlea, using traditional Fabp7 knockout (KO) mice on the C57BL/6 background. We found that Fabp7 KO mice showed delayed AHL progression and milder cochlear degeneration. However, the genotype of the Cdh23 region flanking Fabp7 was still that of 129/Sv origin (Cdh23<sup>753GG</sup>). Our findings reveal the potential risk of contamination for traditional transgenic mice generated on the C57BL/6 background."	"The aim of this study was the genetic diagnosis by next generation sequencing (NGS) of a patient diagnosed with Usher syndrome type 2 and the functional evaluation of the identified genetic variants to establish a phenotype-genotype correlation.Whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis identified two heterozygous intronic variants in <i>CDH23</i>, a gene responsible of Usher syndrome type 1. Evaluation of the putative splicing effects was performed in vivo, in whole blood samples, and in vitro, by transfection of midigene constructs in HEK293T cells.Two intronic variants were identified in intron 45 of <i>CDH23</i>-one novel, c.6050-15G&gt;A, and the other, c.6050-9G&gt;A, already reported as a noncanonical splice site (NCSS) mutation-with partial functional characterization. In vivo and in vitro analyses showed aberrant transcripts by the addition of 13 and 7 nucleotides to exon 46, respectively. Transcript degradation by nonsense mediated decay (NMD) in blood cells could only be prevented by cycloheximide treatment. Midigene constructs showed that the two variants contributed to exon skipping and generated aberrantly spliced transcripts.A combination of in vivo and in vitro assays provided a comprehensive view of the physiological effects of NCSS variants, which in this case led to a clinical reassignment of the proband as affected with atypical USH1 syndrome."
"CIB2"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Calcium- and Integrin-Binding protein 2 (CIB2) is a small and ubiquitously expressed protein with largely unknown biological function but ascertained role in hearing physiology and disease. Recent studies found that CIB2 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> with moderate affinity and dimerizes under conditions mimicking the physiological ones. Here we provided new lines of evidence on CIB2 oligomeric state and the mechanism of interaction with the α7B integrin target. Based on a combination of native mass spectrometry, chemical cross-linking/mass spectrometry, analytical gel filtration, dynamic light scattering and molecular dynamics simulations we conclude that CIB2 is monomeric under all tested conditions and presents uncommon hydrodynamic properties, most likely due to the high content of hydrophobic solvent accessible surface. Surface plasmon resonance shows that the interaction with α7B occurs with relatively low affinity and is limited to the cytosolic region proximal to the membrane, being kinetically favored in the presence of physiological Mg<sup>2+</sup> and in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although CIB2 binds to an α7B peptide in a 1:1 stoichiometry, the formation of the complex might induce binding of another CIB2 molecule."	"Previously, we detected that 14-3-3 protein epsilon (YWHAE) was involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and tyrosinase-mediated pigmentation. In this study, we aimed to identify critical factors associated with YWHAE in human keratinocytes using high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches to reveal its functions in skin. We overexpressed YWHAE in human HaCaT keratinocytes and then conducted serial HTS studies, including RNA sequencing integrated with antibody arrays and the implementation of bioinformatics algorithms. Cumulatively, these approaches identified several novel genes in keratinocytes associated with the function of YWHAE including KRT9, KRT1, KRT6C, BST2, CIB2, APH1B, ACTC1, IFI27, TUBA1A, CAPN6, UTY, MX2, and MAPK15, based on RNA sequencing data, and MAPK1, MMP2, TYK2, NOS3, and CASP3, based on antibody array data. In particular, CD37 is a unique gene that was detected and validated in all the methods applied in this study. By integrating the datasets obtained from these HTS studies and utilizing the strengths of each method, we obtained new insights into the functional role of YWHAE in skin keratinocytes. The approach used here could contribute to the clinical understanding of YWHAE-associated applications in the treatment of AD disease.

Although the molecular epidemiology of Usher syndrome has been well studied in Europe and United States, there is a lack of studies in other regions like Africa or Central and South America.We designed a NGS panel that included the 10 USH causative genes (<i>MYO7A</i>, <i>USH1C</i>, <i>CDH23</i>, <i>PCDH15</i>, <i>USH1G</i>, <i>CIB2</i>, <i>USH2A</i>, <i>ADGRV1</i>, <i>WHRN</i>, and <i>CLRN1</i>), four USH associated genes (<i>HARS</i>, <i>PDZD7</i>, <i>CEP250</i>, and <i>C2orf71</i>), and the region comprising the deep-intronic c.7595-2144A&gt;G mutation in <i>USH2A</i>.NGS sequencing was performed in 11 USH patients from Cuba. All the cases were solved. We found the responsible mutations in the <i>USH2A</i>, <i>ADGRV1</i>, <i>CDH23</i>, <i>PCDH15</i>, and <i>CLRN1</i> genes. Four mutations have not been previously reported. Two mutations are recurrent in this study: c.619C&gt;T (p.Arg207<sup>∗</sup>) in <i>CLRN1</i>, previously reported in two unrelated Spanish families of Basque origin, and c.4488G&gt;C (p.Gln1496His) in <i>CDH23</i>, first described in a large Cuban family. Additionally, c.4488G&gt;C has been reported two more times in the literature in two unrelated families of Spanish origin.Although the sample size is very small, it is tempting to speculate that the gene frequencies in Cuba are distinct from other populations mainly due to an &quot;island effect&quot; and genetic drift. The two recurrent mutations appear to be of Spanish origin. Further studies with a larger cohort are needed to elucidate the real genetic landscape of Usher syndrome in the Cuban population."	"In proestrus, the changing gonadal hormone milieu alters the physiological properties of GnRH neurons and contributes to the development of the GnRH surge. We hypothesized that proestrus also influences the expression of different ion channel genes in mouse GnRH neurons. Therefore, we performed gene expression profiling of GnRH neurons collected from intact, proestrous and metestrous GnRH-GFP transgenic mice, respectively. Proestrus changed the expression of 37 ion channel and 8 calcium homeostasis-regulating genes. Voltage-gated sodium channels responded with upregulation of three alpha subunits (<i>Scn2a1</i>, <i>Scn3a</i>, and <i>Scn9a</i>). Within the voltage-gated potassium channel class, <i>Kcna1</i>, <i>Kcnd3</i>, <i>Kcnh3</i>, and <i>Kcnq2</i> were upregulated, while others (<i>Kcna4</i>, <i>Kcnc3</i>, <i>Kcnd2</i>, and <i>Kcng1</i>) underwent downregulation. Proestrus also had impact on inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits manifested in enhanced expression of <i>Kcnj9</i> and <i>Kcnj10</i> genes, whereas <i>Kcnj1</i>, <i>Kcnj11</i>, and <i>Kcnj12</i> subunit genes were downregulated. The two-pore domain potassium channels also showed differential expression with upregulation of <i>Kcnk1</i> and reduced expression of three subunit genes (<i>Kcnk7</i>, <i>Kcnk12</i>, and <i>Kcnk16</i>). Changes in expression of chloride channels involved both the voltage-gated (<i>Clcn3</i> and <i>Clcn6</i>) and the intracellular (<i>Clic1</i>) subtypes. Regarding the pore-forming alpha-1 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, two (<i>Cacna1b</i> and <i>Cacna1h</i>) were upregulated, while <i>Cacna1g</i> showed downregulation. The ancillary subunits were also differentially regulated (<i>Cacna2d1</i>, <i>Cacna2d2</i>, <i>Cacnb1</i>, <i>Cacnb3</i>, <i>Cacnb4</i>, <i>Cacng5</i>, <i>Cacng6</i>, and <i>Cacng8</i>). In addition, ryanodine receptor 1 (<i>Ryr1</i>) gene was downregulated, while a transient receptor potential cation channel (<i>Trpm3</i>) gene showed enhanced expression. Genes encoding proteins regulating the intracellular calcium homeostasis were also influenced (<i>Calb1</i>, <i>Hpca</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Hpcal4</i>, <i>Cabp7</i>, <i>Cab 39l</i>, and <i>Cib2</i>). The differential expression of genes coding for ion channel proteins in GnRH neurons at late proestrus indicates that the altering hormone milieu contributes to remodeling of different kinds of ion channels of GnRH neurons, which might be a prerequisite of enhanced cellular activity of GnRH neurons and the subsequent surge release of the neurohormone."	"To describe the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of Usher syndrome after 6 years of studies by next-generation sequencing, and propose an up-to-date classification of Usher genes in patients with both visual and hearing impairments suggesting Usher syndrome, and in patients with seemingly isolated deafness.The systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was based on Cochrane and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We performed 1) a meta-analysis of data from 11 next-generation sequencing studies in 684 patients with Usher syndrome; 2) a meta-analysis of data from 21 next-generation studies in 2,476 patients with seemingly isolated deafness, to assess the involvement of Usher genes in seemingly nonsyndromic hearing loss, and thus the proportion of patients at high risk of subsequent retinitis pigmentosa (RP); 3) a statistical analysis of differences between parts 1) and 2).In patients with both visual and hearing impairments, the biallelic disease-causing mutation rate was assessed for each Usher gene to propose a classification by frequency: USH2A: 50% (341/684) of patients, MYO7A: 21% (144/684), CDH23: 6% (39/684), ADGRV1: 5% (35/684), PCDH15: 3% (21/684), USH1C: 2% (17/684), CLRN1: 2% (14/684), USH1G: 1% (9/684), WHRN: 0.4% (3/684), PDZD7 0.1% (1/684), CIB2 (0/684). In patients with seemingly isolated sensorineural deafness, 7.5% had disease-causing mutations in Usher genes, and are therefore at high risk of developing RP. These new findings provide evidence that usherome dysfunction is the second cause of genetic sensorineural hearing loss after connexin dysfunction.These results promote generalization of early molecular screening for Usher syndrome in deaf children."	"Usher syndrome is a rare disorder causing retinitis pigmentosa, together with sensorineural hearing loss. Due to the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of this disease, the best method to screen the causative mutations is by high-throughput sequencing. In this study, we tested a semiconductor chip based sequencing approach with 77 unrelated patients, as a molecular diagnosis routine. In addition, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification and microarray-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization techniques were applied to detect large rearrangements, and minigene assays were performed to confirm the mRNA processing aberrations caused by splice-site mutations. The designed panel included all the USH causative genes (MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15, USH1G, CIB2, USH2A, ADGRV1, WHRN and CLRN1) as well as four uncertainly associated genes (HARS, PDZD7, CEP250 and C2orf71). The outcome showed an overall mutation detection ratio of 82.8% and allowed the identification of 42 novel putatively pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, we detected two novel nonsense mutations in CEP250 in a patient with a disease mimicking Usher syndrome that associates visual impairment due to cone-rod dystrophy and progressive hearing loss. Therefore, this approach proved reliable results for the molecular diagnosis of the disease and also allowed the consolidation of the CEP250 gene as disease causative for an Usher-like phenotype."	"Consanguineous Pakistani pedigrees segregating deafness have contributed decisively to the discovery of 31 of the 68 genes associated with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss (HL) worldwide. In this study, we utilized genome-wide genotyping, Sanger and exome sequencing to identify 163 DNA variants in 41 previously reported HL genes segregating in 321 Pakistani families. Of these, 70 (42.9%) variants identified in 29 genes are novel. As expected from genetic studies of disorders segregating in consanguineous families, the majority of affected individuals (94.4%) are homozygous for HL-associated variants, with the other variants being compound heterozygotes. The five most common HL genes in the Pakistani population are SLC26A4, MYO7A, GJB2, CIB2 and HGF, respectively. Our study provides a profile of the genetic etiology of HL in Pakistani families, which will allow for the development of more efficient genetic diagnostic tools, aid in accurate genetic counseling, and guide application of future gene-based therapies. These findings are also valuable in interpreting pathogenicity of variants that are potentially associated with HL in individuals of all ancestries. The Pakistani population, and its infrastructure for studying human genetics, will continue to be valuable to gene discovery for HL and other inherited disorders."	"The TMC1 channel was identified as a protein essential for hearing in mouse and human, and recognized as one of a family of eight such proteins in mammals. The TMC family is part of a superfamily of seven branches, which includes the TMEM16s. Vertebrate hair cells express both TMC1 and TMC2. They are located at the tips of stereocilia and are required for hair cell mechanotransduction. TMC1 assembles as a dimer and its similarity to the TMEM16s has enabled a predicted tertiary structure with an ion conduction pore in each subunit of the dimer. Cysteine mutagenesis of the pore supports the role of TMC1 and TMC2 as the core channel proteins of a larger mechanotransduction complex that includes PCDH15 and LHFPL5, and perhaps TMIE, CIB2 and others."	"Calcium and integrin binding protein 2 (CIB2) shares with the other members of the CIB family the ability to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> via two functional EF-hand motifs, namely EF3 and EF4. As a cation sensor, CIB2 is able to switch to a conformation likely associated with specific biological functions yet to be clarified. Recent findings demonstrate the involvement of CIB2 in hearing physiology and a single, conservative point mutation (p.E64D) has been related to Usher Syndrome type 1J (USH1J) and non-syndromic hearing loss. We present an exhaustive biochemical and biophysical characterization of human wild type (WT) and E64D CIB2. We found that CIB2 does not possibly work as a calcium sensor under physiological conditions, its affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (K<sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup> = 0.5 mM) being too low for detecting normal intracellular levels. Instead, CIB2 displays a significantly high affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup> (K<sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup> = 290 μM), and it is probably Mg<sup>2+</sup> -bound under physiological conditions. At odds with the homologous protein CIB1, CIB2 forms a non-covalent dimer under conditions that mimic the physiological ones, and as such it interacts with its physiological target α7B integrin. NMR spectroscopy revealed a long-range allosteric communication between the residue E64, located at the N-terminal domain, and the metal cation binding site EF3, located at the C-terminal domain. The conservative E64D mutation breaks up such inter-domain communication resulting in the impaired ability of CIB2 to switch to its Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound form. The ability to bind the target integrin peptide was substantially conserved for E64D CIB2, thus suggesting that the molecular defect associated with USH1J resides in its inability to sense Mg<sup>2+</sup> and adopt the required conformation."	"Consanguinity rate is high in Algeria, and the population is thus at high risk for genetic diseases transmitted on an autosomal recessive mode. Inherited congenital hearing impairment (HI) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, which affects approximately 1 in 800 Algerian newborns. Several hundreds of genes responsible for deafness have been reported among which more than one hundred are responsible for isolated deafness, of which 19 have already been reported to be involved in the Algerian population. This study focuses on patients from the Ghardaïa province, an ethnically and geographically isolated region of Southern Algeria that has the highest consanguinity rate in the country (56%).Eleven families, with at least two related members experiencing moderate to profound congenital HI, were recruited and screened for mutations in known HI genes.A preliminary screening for common mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 identified the prevalent GJB2:c.35delG mutation in four families. Targeted exome sequencing further identified the causal mutations in the remaining seven families: CIB2:c.97C &gt; T; p.(Arg33*), MYO7A:c.470+1G &gt; A; p.(?), and SLC26A4:c.410C &gt; T; p.(Ser137Leu) biallelic mutations in two families each, and a TECTA:c.2743 A &gt; G; p.(Ile915Val) monoallelic mutation in the only family with autosomal dominant transmission of the HI. Of note, the missense mutations of SLC26A4 and TECTA had not been previously reported.These results further substantiate the genetic heterogeneity of HI, even in reportedly isolated populations. However, several families may harbor the same mutations as a result of a long history of marriages between relatives. This study has important implications for the HI molecular diagnosis strategy, and to develop genetic counseling for families originating from the Ghardaïa province of Algeria."	"Pork is the most popular meat in the world. Unfortunately, the selection pressure focused on high meat content led to a reduction in pork quality. The present study used RNA-seq technology to identify metabolic process genes related to pork quality traits and fat deposition. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between pigs of Pulawska and Polish Landrace breeds for two the most important muscles (semimembranosus and longissimus dorsi). A total of 71 significant DEGs were reported: 15 for longissimus dorsi and 56 for semimembranosus muscles. The genes overexpressed in Pulawska pigs were involved in lipid metabolism (APOD, LXRA, LIPE, AP2B1, ENSSSCG00000028753 and OAS2) and proteolysis (CST6, CTSD, ISG15 and UCHL1). In Polish Landrace pigs, genes playing a role in biological adhesion (KIT, VCAN, HES1, SFRP2, CDH11, SSX2IP and PCDH17), actin cytoskeletal organisation (FRMD6, LIMK1, KIF23 and CNN1) and calcium ion binding (PVALB, CIB2, PCDH17, VCAN and CDH11) were transcriptionally more active. The present study allows for better understanding of the physiological processes associated with lipid metabolism and muscle fiber organization. This information could be helpful in further research aiming to estimate the genetic markers."	"Calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 (CIB2) belongs to a protein family with four known members, CIB1 through CIB4, which are characterized by multiple calcium-binding EF-hand domains. Among the family members, the <i>Cib1</i> and <i>Cib2</i> genes are expressed in mouse cochlear hair cells, and mutations in the human <i>CIB2</i> gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness DFNB48 and syndromic deafness USH1J. To further explore the function of CIB1 and CIB2 in hearing, we established <i>Cib1</i> and <i>Cib2</i> knockout mice using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing technique. We found that loss of CIB1 protein does not affect auditory function, whereas loss of CIB2 protein causes profound hearing loss in mice. Further investigation revealed that hair cell stereocilia development is affected in <i>Cib2</i> knockout mice. Noticeably, loss of CIB2 abolishes mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) currents in auditory hair cells. In conclusion, we show here that although both CIB1 and CIB2 are readily detected in the cochlea, only loss of CIB2 results in profound hearing loss, and that CIB2 is essential for auditory hair cell MET."	"The genetic, mutational and phenotypic spectrum of deafness-causing genes shows great diversity and pleiotropy. The best examples are the group of genes, which when mutated can either cause non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) or the most common dual sensory impairment, Usher syndrome (USH). Variants in the CIB2 gene have been previously reported to cause hearing loss at the DFNB48 locus and deaf-blindness at the USH1J locus. In this study, we characterize the phenotypic spectrum in a multiethnic cohort with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) due to variants in the CIB2 gene. Of the 6 families we ascertained, 3 segregated novel loss-of-function (LOF) variants, 2 families segregated missense variants (1 novel) and 1 family segregated a previously reported pathogenic variant in trans with a frameshift variant. This report is the first to show that biallelic LOF variants in CIB2 cause ARNSHL and not USH. In the era of precision medicine, providing the correct diagnosis (NSHL vs USH) is essential for patient care as it impacts potential intervention and prevention options for patients. Here, we provide evidence disqualifying CIB2 as an USH-causing gene."	"CIB2 and GJB2 genes variants contribute significantly in familial cases of prelingual recessive hearing loss (HL). This study was aimed to determine the CIB2 and GJB2 variants and associated phenotype in 150 non-familial individuals with HL. After getting informed consent, 150 non-familial deaf patients were enrolled and blood samples were obtained for DNA extraction. Pure tone air conduction audiometry was performed. Coding exons of CIB2 and GJB2 genes were Sanger sequenced. A tetra primer ARMS assay was developed for recurrent CIB2 variant. Four bi-allelic GJB2 variants, c.71G&gt;A p.(Trp24*), c.231G&gt;A p.(Trp77*), c.235delC p.(Leu79Cysfs3*) and c.35delG p.(Gly11Leufs24*), were found in nine hearing impaired individuals. We also found four homozygotes and five carriers of c.380G&gt;A p. (Arg127His) variant of controversial clinical significance. CIB2 sequencing revealed single recurrent variant c.272T&gt;C p. (Phe91Ser) segregating with HL in ten individuals. Among our patients, c.71G&gt;A (p.Trp24*) was the most common variant, accounted for 45% of GJB2 variants. Two known GJB2 variants, c.235delC p. (Leu79Cysfs3*) and c.310del14 p. (Lys105Argfs2*), are reported here for the first time in Pakistani population. Our data further support the benign nature of c.380G&gt;A p. (Arg127His) variant. For CIB2, c.272T&gt;C p. (Phe91Ser) is the second common cause of HL among our sporadic cases. Phenotypically, in our patients, individuals homozygous for GJB2 variants had profound HL, whereas CIB2 homozygotes had severe to profound prelingual HL. Our results suggest that GJB2 and CIB2 are common cause of HL in different Pakistani ethnicities."	"Defects of CIB2, calcium- and integrin-binding protein 2, have been reported to cause isolated deafness, DFNB48 and Usher syndrome type-IJ, characterized by congenital profound deafness, balance defects and blindness. We report here two new nonsense mutations (pGln12* and pTyr110*) in <i>CIB2</i> patients displaying nonsyndromic profound hearing loss, with no evidence of vestibular or retinal dysfunction. Also, the generated <i>CIB2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice display an early onset profound deafness and have normal balance and retinal functions. In these mice, the mechanoelectrical transduction currents are totally abolished in the auditory hair cells, whilst they remain unchanged in the vestibular hair cells. The hair bundle morphological abnormalities of <i>CIB2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, unlike those of mice defective for the other five known USH1 proteins, begin only after birth and lead to regression of the stereocilia and rapid hair-cell death. This essential role of CIB2 in mechanotransduction and cell survival that, we show, is restricted to the cochlea, probably accounts for the presence in <i>CIB2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and <i>CIB2</i> patients, unlike in Usher syndrome, of isolated hearing loss without balance and vision deficits."	"The human calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB) family is composed of CIB1, CIB2, CIB3, and CIB4 proteins and the CIB4 gene affects fertility. Kermani sheep is one of the most important breeds of Iranian sheep breeds. The aim of this study was to analyze for the first time molecular characteristics of the CIB4 gene and protein in Kermani sheep. Different tissues were collected from the Kermani sheep and real time PCR was performed. The PCR products were sequenced, comparative analyses of the nucleotide sequences were performed, a phylogenetic tree was constructed, and different characteristics of CIB4 proteins were predicted. Real time PCR results showed that the CIB4 gene is expressed only in testis of Kermani sheep. The cDNA nucleotide sequence was identical with small tail Han sheep, cattle, goat, camel, horse, dog, mouse and human, respectively 100, 99, 99, 98, 98, 96, 96, and 96%. Hence, it can be suggested that the CIB4 gene plays a role in male fertility. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, sheep CIB4 gene has a close relationship with goat and cattle first, and then with camel and whale. Although we demonstrated that CIB4 is a testis-specific gene, expressed only in the testis and it interacts with other proteins, the mechanisms by which CIB4 expression is regulated need to be elucidated."	"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is a key regulator of the cellular balance between proapoptotic and prosurvival sphingolipids. Oncogenic signaling by SK1 relies on its localization to the plasma membrane, which is mediated by the calcium and integrin binding protein CIB1 via its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-myristoyl switch function. Here we show that another member of the CIB family, CIB2, plays a surprisingly opposite role to CIB1 in the regulation of SK1 signaling. CIB2 bound SK1 on the same site as CIB1, yet it lacks the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-myristoyl switch function. As a result, CIB2 blocked translocation of SK1 to the plasma membrane and inhibited its subsequent signaling, which included sensitization to TNFα-induced apoptosis and inhibition of Ras-induced neoplastic transformation. CIB2 was significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer and low CIB2 expression was associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. Notably, reintroduction of CIB2 in ovarian cancer cells blocked plasma membrane localization of endogenous SK1, reduced <i>in vitro</i> neoplastic growth and tumor growth in mice, and suppressed cell motility and invasiveness both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> Consistent with the <i>in vitro</i> synergistic effects between the SK1-specific inhibitor SK1-I and standard chemotherapeutics, expression of CIB2 also sensitized ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin. Together, these findings identify CIB2 as a novel endogenous suppressor of SK1 signaling and potential prognostic marker and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SK1 in this gynecologic malignancy. <i>Cancer Res; 77(18); 4823-34. ©2017 AACR</i>."	"Inner ear hair cells detect sound through deflection of stereocilia, the microvilli-like projections that are arranged in rows of graded heights. Calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 is essential for hearing and localizes to stereocilia, but its exact function is unknown. Here, we have characterized two mutant mouse lines, one lacking calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 and one carrying a human deafness-related Cib2 mutation, and show that both are deaf and exhibit no mechanotransduction in auditory hair cells, despite the presence of tip links that gate the mechanotransducer channels. In addition, mechanotransducing shorter row stereocilia overgrow in hair cell bundles of both Cib2 mutants. Furthermore, we report that calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 binds to the components of the hair cell mechanotransduction complex, TMC1 and TMC2, and these interactions are disrupted by deafness-causing Cib2 mutations. We conclude that calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 is required for normal operation of the mechanotransducer channels and is involved in limiting the growth of transducing stereocilia.Inner ear hair cells detect sound through deflection of stereocilia that harbor mechanically-gated channels. Here the authors show that protein responsible for Usher syndrome, CIB2, interacts with these channels and is essential for their function and hearing in mice."	"Cochlear implantation (CI), which directly stimulates the cochlear nerves, is the most effective and widely used medical intervention for patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. The etiology of the hearing loss is speculated to have a major influence of CI outcomes, particularly in cases resulting from mutations in genes preferentially expressed in the spiral ganglion region. To elucidate precise gene expression levels in each part of the cochlea, we performed laser-capture micro dissection in combination with next-generation sequencing analysis and determined the expression levels of all known deafness-associated genes in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, lateral wall, and spiral limbs. The results were generally consistent with previous reports based on immunocytochemistry or in situ hybridization. As a notable result, the genes associated with many kinds of syndromic hearing loss (such as Clpp, Hars2, Hsd17b4, Lars2 for Perrault syndrome, Polr1c and Polr1d for Treacher Collins syndrome, Ndp for Norrie Disease, Kal for Kallmann syndrome, Edn3 and Snai2 for Waardenburg Syndrome, Col4a3 for Alport syndrome, Sema3e for CHARGE syndrome, Col9a1 for Sticker syndrome, Cdh23, Cib2, Clrn1, Pcdh15, Ush1c, Ush2a, Whrn for Usher syndrome and Wfs1 for Wolfram syndrome) showed higher levels of expression in the spiral ganglion than in other parts of the cochlea. This dataset will provide a base for more detailed analysis in order to clarify gene functions in the cochlea as well as predict CI outcomes based on gene expression data."	"Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common cause of inherited deaf-blindness, manifested as USH1, USH2 and USH3 clinical types. The protein products of USH2 causative and modifier genes, USH2A, ADGRV1, WHRN and PDZD7, interact to assemble a multiprotein complex at the ankle link region of the mechanosensitive stereociliary bundle in hair cells. Defects in this complex cause stereociliary bundle disorganization and hearing loss. The four USH2 proteins also interact in vitro with USH1 proteins including myosin VIIa, USH1G (SANS), CIB2 and harmonin. However, it is unclear whether the interactions between USH1 and USH2 proteins occur in vivo and whether USH1 proteins play a role in USH2 complex assembly in hair cells. In this study, we identified a novel interaction between myosin VIIa and PDZD7 by FLAG pull-down assay. We further investigated the role of the above-mentioned four USH1 proteins in the cochlear USH2 complex assembly using USH1 mutant mice. We showed that only myosin VIIa is indispensable for USH2 complex assembly at ankle links, indicating the potential transport and/or anchoring role of myosin VIIa for USH2 proteins in hair cells. However, myosin VIIa is not required for USH2 complex assembly in photoreceptors. We further showed that, while PDZ protein harmonin is not involved, its paralogous USH2 proteins, PDZD7 and whirlin, function synergistically in USH2 complex assembly in cochlear hair cells. In summary, our studies provide novel insight into the functional relationship between USH1 and USH2 proteins in the cochlea and the retina as well as the disease mechanisms underlying USH1 and USH2."
"CLDN14"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Proper functioning of the auditory nerve is of critical importance for auditory rehabilitation by cochlear implants. Here we used the Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> mouse to study in detail the effects of Claudin 14 loss on auditory synapses and the auditory nerve. Mutations in the tight junction protein Claudin 14 cause autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB29) in humans and mice, due to extensive degeneration of outer and inner hair cells. Here we show that massive inner hair cell loss in Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> mice starts after the third postnatal week. Immunohistochemical analysis, using presynaptic Ribeye and postsynaptic GluR2 or PSD 95 as markers, revealed the degeneration of full ribbon synapses in inner hair cells from apical cochlear regions already at postnatal day 12 (P12). At P20, significant reduction in number of ribbon synapses has been observed for all cochlear regions and the loss of synaptic ribbons becomes even more prominent in residual inner hair cells from middle and apical cochlear regions at P45, which by then lost more than 40% of all ribbon synapses. In contrast to excessive noise exposure, loss of Claudin 14 does not cause an increase in &quot;orphan&quot; ribbons with no postsynaptic counterpart due to a reduction of postsynaptic structures. Hair cell loss in Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> mice is associated with regression of peripheral auditory nerve processes, especially of outer radial fibers, which normally innervate the outer hair cells. The number of spiral ganglion neurons per area, however, was unchanged between the genotypes. Different effects were observed in the cochlear nucleus complex (CNC), the central projection area of the auditory nerve. While the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) showed a significant 19.7% volume reduction, VGLUT-1 input was reduced by 34.4% in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) but not in the DCN of Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Taken together, massive inner hair cell loss starts after the third postnatal week in Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but is preceded by the loss of ribbon synapses, which may be a first sign of an ongoing degeneration process in otherwise morphologically inconspicuously inner hair cells. In addition to the regression of peripheral nerve processes, reduced levels of VGLUT-1 in the VCN of Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> mice suggests that Claudin 14 loss does not only cause hair cell loss but also affects peripheral and central connectivity of the auditory nerve."	"Claudins are integral proteins expressed at the tight junctions of epithelial and endothelial cells. In the mammalian kidney, every tubular segment express a specific set of claudins that give to that segment unique properties regarding permeability and selectivity of the paracellular pathway. So far, 3 claudins (10b, 16 and 19) have been causally traced to rare human syndromes: variants of <i>CLDN10b</i> cause HELIX syndrome and variants of <i>CLDN16</i> or <i>CLDN19</i> cause familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. The review summarizes our current knowledge on the physiology of mammalian tight junctions and paracellular ion transport, as well as on the role of the 3 above-mentioned claudins in health and disease. Claudin 14, although not having been causally linked to any rare renal disease, is also considered, because available evidence suggests that it may interact with claudin 16. Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms of <i>CLDN14</i> are associated with urinary calcium excretion and/or kidney stones. For each claudin considered, the pattern of expression, the function and the human syndrome caused by pathogenic variants are described."	"The development of cancer occurs with various genomic and epigenetic modifications that act as indicators for early diagnosis and treatment. Recent data have shown that the abnormal expression of the claudin (CLDN) tight junction (TJ) proteins is involved in the tumorigenesis of numerous human cancers. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to explore the differences in the expression of the CLDN TJ proteins in breast carcinoma tissues and non-neoplastic tissues. The results showed that CLDN5, CLDN9, CLDN12 and CLDN13 were not expressed in breast carcinoma tissues or non-neoplastic tissues. CLDN1, CLDN3, CLDN8 and CLDN10 were expressed in breast carcinoma and non-neoplastic tissues, but there was no significant difference between the expression of these CLDN proteins among them. The expression of CLDN2, -6, -11 and -14 varied between the breast carcinoma and non-neoplastic tissues. Moreover, 86 samples of breast carcinoma and non-neoplastic tissues were examined for the expression of CLDN2, -6, -11 and -14 by streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemical staining. The data revealed that the CLDN2, CLDN6, and CLDN14 were expressed in the cell membrane and the expression levels of these proteins were downregulated in breast carcinoma. The CLDN11 was expressed in cell cytoplasm and the expression level of CLDN11 was upregulated compared with those in non-neoplastic tissues. Consistent with these findings, the expression of CLDN2, CLDN6 and CLDN14 were downregulated, while the expression of CLDN11 was upregulated in breast carcinoma compared with those in non-neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, the associations between these CLDNs and clinicopathologic indicators were analyzed, and these CLDN expressions were revealed to be associated with distant metastasis and to predict a poor prognosis. In conclusion, our data showed that the expression levels of CLDN2, -6, -11 and -14 differed between breast carcinoma tissues and histologically non-neoplastic tissues, and the expression levels of these CLDNs may be useful as molecular markers for the diagnosis of breast carcinoma as well as for the determination of metastasis and prognosis."	"Meniere's disease (MD) is a complex disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo attacks, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), tinnitus and aural fullness. MD has been attributed to an accumulation of endolymph in the cochlear duct. The diagnosis of MD is based on the phenomenological association of clinical symptoms and the demonstration of SNHL during the vertigo attacks. Several evidences support a genetic contribution to MD including differences in the prevalence according to the ethnic background and familial aggregation in European and Asian populations in multiplex families with autosomal dominant inheritance. The genetic underpinnings of MD may include some rare monogenic forms in isolated families and a polygenic contribution in most familial and sporadic cases. So, familial MD has been reported in 6-8% of sporadic cases and several genes have been described in single Familial MD including FAM136A, DTNA, PRKCB, SEMA3D and DPT, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Multiplex rare missense variants in OTOG gene have been reported in 33% of familial MD, suggesting multiallelic inheritance. Moreover, the genetic landscape of sporadic MD is more complex and it involves multiplex rare variants in several SNHL genes such as GJB2, USH1G, SLC26A4, ESRRB, and CLDN14 and axonal-guidance signalling genes such as NTN4 and NOX3. This review summarizes evidence to support a genetic contribution in MD and the start of deciphering the genetic architecture to design and develop a molecular map of MD."	"Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is a hereditary disorder that affects many populations. Many genes are involved in NSHL and the mutational load of these genes often differs among ethnic groups. Claudin-14 (<i>CLDN14</i>), a tight junction protein, is known to be associated with NSHL in many populations. In this study, we aimed to identify the responsible variants in 3 different Yemeni families affected with NSHL. Firstly, clinical exome sequencing (CES) performed for 3 affected patients from these different families identified a new nonsense variant (c.414G &gt; A) in <i>CLDN14</i>. This variant was then confirmed by Sanger sequencing and PCR-RFLP. Subsequently, four microsatellite markers were used to genotype these families, which revealed a founder effect for this variant. Overall, this study illustrates the implication of the <i>CLDN14</i> gene in the Yemeni population with NSHL and identifies a new founder variant."	"Tight junctions are cellular junctions that play a major role in the epithelial barrier function. In the inner ear, claudins, occludin, tricellulin, and angulins form the bicellular or tricellular binding of membrane proteins. In these, one type of claudin gene, <i>CLDN14</i>, was reported to be responsible for human hereditary hearing loss, DFNB29. Until now, nine pathogenic variants have been reported, and most phenotypic features remain unclear. In the present study, genetic screening for 68 previously reported deafness causative genes was carried out to identify <i>CLDN14</i> variants in a large series of Japanese hearing loss patients, and to clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DFNB29 in the Japanese population. One patient had a homozygous novel variant (c.241C&gt;T: p.Arg81Cys) (0.04%: 1/2549). The patient showed progressive bilateral hearing loss, with post-lingual onset. Pure-tone audiograms indicated a high-frequency hearing loss type, and the deterioration gradually spread to other frequencies. The patient showed normal vestibular function. Cochlear implantation improved the patient's sound field threshold levels, but not speech discrimination scores. This report indicated that claudin-14 is essential for maintaining the inner ear environment and suggested the possible phenotypic expansion of DFNB29. This is the first report of a patient with a tight junction variant receiving a cochlear implantation."	"Epidemiological evidence of over 9000 people suggests that daily intake of vinegar whose principal bioactive component is acetic acid is associated with a reduced risk of nephrolithiasis. The underlying mechanism, however, remains largely unknown.We examined the in vitro and in vivo anti-nephrolithiasis effects of vinegar and acetate. A randomized study was performed to confirm the effects of vinegar in humans.We found individuals with daily consumption of vinegar compared to those without have a higher citrate and a lower calcium excretion in urine, two critical molecules for calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stone in humans. We observed that oral administration of vinegar or 5% acetate increased citrate and reduced calcium in urinary excretion, and finally suppressed renal CaOx crystal formation in a rat model. Mechanism dissection suggested that acetate enhanced acetylation of Histone H3 in renal tubular cells and promoted expression of microRNAs-130a-3p, -148b-3p and -374b-5p by increasing H3K9, H3K27 acetylation at their promoter regions. These miRNAs can suppress the expression of Nadc1 and Cldn14, thus enhancing urinary citrate excretion and reducing urinary calcium excretion. Significantly these mechanistic findings were confirmed in human kidney tissues, suggesting similar mechanistic relationships exist in humans. Results from a pilot clinical study indicated that daily intake of vinegar reduced stone recurrence, increased citrate and reduced calcium in urinary excretion in CaOx stone formers without adverse side effects.Vinegar prevents renal CaOx crystal formation through influencing urinary citrate and calcium excretion via epigenetic regulations. Vinegar consumption is a promising strategy to prevent CaOx nephrolithiasis occurrence and recurrence.

"Meniere's disease (MD) is a clinical spectrum of rare disorders characterized by vertigo attacks, associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and tinnitus involving low to medium frequencies. Although it shows familial aggregation with incomplete phenotypic forms and variable expressivity, most cases are considered sporadic. The aim of this study was to investigate the burden for rare variation in SNHL genes in patients with sporadic MD. We conducted a targeted-sequencing study including SNHL and familial MD genes in 890 MD patients to compare the frequency of rare variants in cases using three independent public datasets as controls. Patients with sporadic MD showed a significant enrichment of missense variants in SNHL genes that was not found in the controls. The list of genes includes <i>GJB2, USH1G, SLC26A4, ESRRB</i>, and <i>CLDN14</i>. A rare synonymous variant with unknown significance was found in the <i>MARVELD2</i> gene in several unrelated patients with MD. There is a burden of rare variation in certain SNHL genes in sporadic MD. Furthermore, the interaction of common and rare variants in SNHL genes may have an additive effect on MD phenotype. This study will contribute to design a gene panel for the genetic diagnosis of MD."	"Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) abnormalities during sepsis have been reported, but the underlying mechanisms during acute inflammation are poorly understood. We hypothesized that a decrease in GFR and/or changes in transporters or channels for Mg<sup>2+</sup> could be responsible for the observed Mg<sup>2+</sup> abnormalities. Therefore, we studied the metabolism of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in a murine model of endotoxemia. LPS-induced hypermagnesemia was paralleled by a decrease in creatinine clearance and an increase in the fractional excretion of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In agreement with an altered renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling, endotoxemia decreased the renal expression of claudin (Cldn) 10b, Cldn16, Cldn19, parvalbumin, and of the solute carrier family (Slc) 41a3. Further, LPS increased the renal expression of Cldn14 and Slc41a1. The renal expression of the transient receptor potential melastin (Trpm) 6, Trpm7, and of cyclin M (Cnnm) 2 was unaltered in response to LPS. In vitro studies support a direct effect on the expression of Cldn10b, Cldn14, Cldn16, and Cldn19. Further, endotoxemia increased the fractional excretion of sodium, which was paralleled by a decrease of important renal sodium transporters. In the large intestine, the expression of Trpm7 was increased in response to LPS, whereas the expression of Trpm6 was decreased. Cnnm4 mRNA levels were unchanged in the large intestine. Further, Cldn12 and Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 3 (Slc9a3) expressions were decreased in the small intestine in response to LPS. Our findings indicate that endotoxemia is associated with hypermagnesemia and a disturbed Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling. It seems likely that LPS-induced hypermagnesemia is due to the decrease in renal function in response to LPS."	"Kidney stone disease is a common disorder in Western countries that is associated with significant suffering, morbidity, and cost for the healthcare system. Numerous studies have demonstrated familial aggregation of nephrolithiasis and a twin study estimated the heritability to be 56%. Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies have uncovered several sequence variants that confer increased risk of common complex kidney stone disease. The first reported variants were observed at the CLDN14 locus in the Icelandic population. This finding has since been replicated in other populations. The CLDN14 gene is expressed in tight junctions of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where the protein is believed to play a role in regulation of calcium transport. More recent studies have uncovered variants at the ALPL, SLC34A1, CASR, and TRPV5 loci, the first two genes playing a role in renal handling of phosphate, while the latter two are involved in calcium homeostasis. Although genetic data have provided insights into the molecular basis of kidney stone disease, much remains to be learned about the contribution of genetic factors to stone formation. Nevertheless, the progress made in recent years indicates that exciting times lie ahead in genetic research on kidney stone disease."	"Tight junctions consist of a network of sealing strands that create selective ion permeability barriers between adjoining epithelial or endothelial cells. The current model for tight junction strands consists of paired rows of claudins (Cldn) coupled by a <i>cis</i> interface (X-1) derived from crystalline Cldn15. Here we show that tight junction strands exhibit a broad range of lateral bending, indicating diversity in <i>cis</i> interactions. By combining protein-protein docking, coevolutionary analysis, molecular dynamics, and a mutagenesis screen, we identify a new Cldn-Cldn <i>cis</i> interface (Cis-1) that shares interacting residues with X-1 but has an ~ 17° lateral rotation between monomers. In addition, we found that a missense mutation in a Cldn14 that causes deafness and contributes stronger to Cis-1 than to X-1 prevents strand formation in cultured cells. Our results suggest that Cis-1 contributes to the inherent structural flexibility of tight junction strands and is required for maintaining permeability barrier function and hearing."	"Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is indispensable for several vital functions, such as neurotransmission, cardiac conductance, blood glucose, blood pressure regulation, and proper function of more than 300 enzymes. Thus, Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is subject to tight regulation. Besides the fast and immediate regulation of plasma Mg<sup>2+</sup>, a major part of Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is realized by a concerted action of epithelial molecular structures that tightly control intestinal uptake and renal absorption. This mechanism is provided by a combination of para- and transcellular pathways. Whereas the first pathway provides the organism with a maximal amount of vital substances by a minimal energy expenditure, the latter enables controlling and fine-tuning by means of local and regional regulatory systems and also, hormonal control. The paracellular pathway is driven by an electrochemical gradient and realized in principal by the tight junction (TJ), a supramolecular organization of membrane-bound proteins and their adaptor and scaffolding proteins. TJ determinants are claudins (CLDN), a family of membrane spanning proteins that generate a barrier or a pore between two adjacent epithelial cells. Many insights into molecular mechanisms of Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling have been achieved by the identification of alterations and mutations in human genes which cause disorders of paracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> pathways (CLDN10, CLDN14, CLDN16, CLDN19). Also, in the distal convoluted tubule, a basolateral protein, CNNM2, causes if mutated, familial dominant and also recessive renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> wasting, albeit its true function has not been clarified yet, but is assumed to play a key role in the transcellular pathway. Moreover, mutations in human genes that are involved in regulating these proteins directly or indirectly cause, if mutated human diseases, mostly in combination with comorbidities as diabetes, cystic renal disease, or metabolic abnormalities. Generation and characterization of animal models harboring the corresponding mutations have further contributed to the elucidation of physiology and pathophysiology of Mg<sup>2+</sup> disorders. Finally, high-end crystallization techniques allow understanding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling in more detail. As this field is rapidly growing, we describe here the principles of physiology and pathophysiology of epithelial transport of renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis with emphasis on recently identified mechanisms involved."	"Claudins (CLDNs) are a major transmembrane protein component of tight junctions (TJs) in endothelia and epithelia. CLDNs are not only essential for sustaining the role of TJs in cell permeability but are also vital for cell signaling through protein-protein interactions. Ozone induces oxidative stress and lung inflammation in humans and experimental models, but the impact of ozone on claudins remains poorly understood. This study was to determine the expression of TJ proteins, such as claudin 3, 4, 5, and 14 following ozone exposure. Mice were exposed to 0.1, 1, or 2 ppm of ozone or ambient air for 6 h for 3 days. The impact of ozone on CLDNs, Nrf2, Keap1, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were estimated using immunoblotting, immunohistochemical staining, confocal imaging, and ELISA analysis in mice and bronchial epithelial cells. Mice exposed to ozone experienced increased airway inflammatory cell infiltration and bronchial hyper-responsiveness compared to control mice. Additionally, CLDN3, CLDN4, ROS, Nrf2, and Keap1 protein expression increased, and lung CLDN14 protein expression decreased, in mice exposed to ozone compared with control mice. These results indicate that CLDNs are involved in airway inflammation following ozone exposure, suggesting that ozone affects TJ proteins through oxidative mechanisms."	"Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF1β) cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD-HNF1β), and patients tend to develop renal cysts, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and suffer from electrolyte disturbances, including hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalciuria. Previous HNF1β research focused on the renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT) to elucidate the ADTKD-HNF1β electrolyte phenotype, although 70% of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL). An important regulator of Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption in the TAL is the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). This study used several methods to elucidate the role of HNF1β in electrolyte reabsorption in the TAL. HNF1β ChIP-seq data revealed a conserved HNF1β binding site in the second intron of the CaSR gene. Luciferase-promoter assays displayed a 5.8-fold increase in CaSR expression when HNF1β was present. Expression of the HNF1β p.Lys156Glu mutant, which prevents DNA binding, abolished CaSR expression. Hnf1β knockdown in an immortalized mouse kidney TAL cell line (MKTAL) reduced expression of the CaSR and Cldn14 (claudin 14) by 56% and 48%, respectively, while Cldn10b expression was upregulated 5.0-fold. These results were confirmed in a kidney-specific HNF1β knockout mouse, which exhibited downregulation of the Casr by 81%. Cldn19 and Cldn10b expression levels were also decreased by 37% and 83%, respectively, whereas Cldn3 was upregulated by 4.6-fold. In conclusion, HNF1β is a transcriptional activator of the CaSR. Consequently, patients with HNF1β mutations may have reduced CaSR activity in the kidney, which could explain cyst progression and hyperabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the TAL resulting in hypocalciuria."	"The CLDN14 gene, encoding the tight junction protein Claudin-14, has been proposed as a candidate causative gene affecting autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). Genetic analysis of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) in CLDN14 has been performed in different populations. The role of CLDN14 nsSNVs in contributing to hearing loss in Chinese populations would be investigated in this study.Target screening for CLDN14 variations were conducted in 500 unrelated patients diagnosed with non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL).No reported pathogenic CLDN14 nsSNVs in heterozygote or homozygote were detected in this study, however, we identified 4 heterozygous nsSNVs [c.11C &gt; T, p.(Thr4Met); c.16G &gt; A, p.(Val6Met); c.68T &gt; C, p.(Ile23Thr); c.367A &gt; C, p.(Thr123Pro)] in CLDN14. The 4 nsSNVs are located at claudin-14 transmembrane domains, but assessed to be poorly conservative and non-pathogenic via multiple in silico algorithms. The structure-based analysis also suggested that the 4 nsSNVs had less structural and functional impact on claudin-14.Our findings indicated that CLDN14 might not be a major causative gene for NSHL in Chinese populations, which would contribute to fully understanding the genetic cause of NSHL in the East Asian populations."	"A high incidence of hearing impairment is reported from the village of Dhadkai in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Prevalence of endogamy in this community suggested a common genetic basis for the disorder. A genetic study was undertaken to ascertain the basis for the high incidence of hearing impairment in this region.In a two-step approach to identify the causative mutation/s, a whole-genome-based linkage analysis of an extended family of 45 members was carried out, which included 23 affected and 22 unaffected members. Mutational analysis for the candidate deafness genes helped reveal causative mutations in the family. In addition, seven deafness-causing genes, Cx26, SLC26A4, CLDN14, TMPRSS3, TMC1, TMIE and USH1C, were analyzed in smaller families with hearing impairment.In the 45-member extended family, the critical chromosomal region mapped to 2p24-p22.The c.2122C&gt;T (p.R708X) mutation in OTOF in 2p24-p22was identified as being the causal change. Linkage to 2p24-p22 locus was not observed in a particular branch of this extended family. Analysis of seven known deafness-causing genes in this branch revealed a mutation, c.254T&gt;A (p.V85D), in CLDN14. Among seven small families unrelated to the 45-member extended family, hearing loss was attributable to p.R708X in OTOF in three families and to p.V85D in CLDN14 in one family; a new mutation c.1668T&gt;A (p.Y556X) SLC26A4 was identified in two families and the causative change could not be identified in one family.This study suggested considerable genetic heterogeneity in the causation of hearing loss in Dhadkai. Recessive mutations were observed in at least three genes causing hearing loss: OTOF (p.R708X), SLC26A4 (p.Y556X) and CLDN14 (p.V85D). Mutation p.R708X appeared to be the major cause of hearing impairment in Dhadkai."	"The peripheral deafness gene Mir96 is expressed in both the cochlea and central auditory circuits. To investigate whether it plays a role in the auditory system beyond the cochlea, we characterized homozygous Dmdo/Dmdo mice with a point mutation in miR-96. Anatomical analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in volume of auditory nuclei in Dmdo/Dmdo mice. This decrease resulted from decreased cell size. Non-auditory structures in the brainstem of Dmdo/Dmdo mice or auditory nuclei of the congenital deaf Cldn14-/- mice revealed no such differences. Electrophysiological analysis in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) showed that principal neurons fired preferentially multiple action potentials upon depolarization, in contrast to the single firing pattern prevalent in controls and Cldn14-/- mice. Immunohistochemistry identified significantly reduced expression of two predicted targets of the mutated miR-96, Kv1.6 and BK channel proteins, possibly contributing to the electrophysiological phenotype. Microscopic analysis of the Dmdo/Dmdo calyx of Held revealed a largely absent compartmentalized morphology, as judged by SV2-labeling. Furthermore, MNTB neurons from Dmdo/Dmdo mice displayed larger synaptic short-term depression, slower AMPA-receptor decay kinetics and a larger NMDA-receptor component, reflecting a less matured stage. Again, these synaptic differences were not present between controls and Cldn14-/- mice. Thus, deafness genes differentially affect the auditory brainstem. Furthermore, our study identifies miR-96 as an essential gene regulatory network element of the auditory system which is required for functional maturation in the peripheral and central auditory system alike."	"To examine whether the changes in endolymphatic ion concentrations were involved in hair cells degeneration in claudin-14 knockout (KO) mice (Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup>), we measured the endocochlear potential (EP) along with concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([K]<sub>e</sub>, [Na]<sub>e</sub>, pH<sub>e</sub>, [Ca]<sub>e</sub>) in Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup>, in which hair cells were selectively damaged, and compared with measurements in wild type mice (Wt).We used the Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> from 3 weeks of age, in which the auditory brain responses (ABR) was severely diminished. Using double-barreled ion-selective microelectrodes, we measured [K]<sub>e</sub>, [Na]<sub>e</sub>, pH<sub>e</sub>, and [Ca]<sub>e</sub> in both Wt and Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup> at 8-10 weeks of age.(1) In Wt, the EP was +92mV. [K]<sub>e</sub>, [Na]<sub>e</sub>, pH<sub>e</sub>, and [Ca]<sub>e</sub> were 169mM, ∼1.0mM, 7.50, and 395nM, respectively. In the Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup>, the EP was +96mV. [K]<sub>e</sub>, [Na]<sub>e</sub>, pH<sub>e</sub>, and [Ca]<sub>e</sub> were 167mM, ∼1.0mM, 7.73, and 179nM, respectively. No significant differences in the above values were observed between Wt and Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup>. (2) A significant linear correlation between EP and [Ca]<sub>e</sub> (R=0.93) was observed for both Wt and Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup>, but no correlation was observed between EP and K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, or H<sup>+</sup>.These findings suggest that (1) the changes in endolymphatic ion concentrations might not be involved in hair cells degeneration in Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup>, (2) [Ca]<sub>e</sub> might be regulated by EP in both Wt and Cldn14<sup>-/-</sup>."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Urolithiasis has a high prevalence and recurrence rate. Prevention is key to patient management, but risk stratification is challenging. In particular, genetic predisposition for urinary stones is not fully understood.To review current evidence of potential causative genes for idiopathic urolithiasis and map their relationships to one another. This evidence is essential for future establishment of molecular targeted therapy.A systematic literature review from 2007 to 2017 was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses guidelines. The search was restricted to human studies conducted as either case-control or genome-wide association studies, and published in English. We also performed a causal network analysis of candidate genes gained from the systematic review using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).During the systematic screening of literature, 30 papers were selected for the review. A total of 20 genes with 42 polymorphisms/variants were found to be associated with urolithiasis risk. Their functional roles were mainly categorized as stone matrix, calcium and phosphate regulation, urinary concentration and constitution, and inflammation/oxidative stress. IPA network analysis revealed that these genes connected via signaling pathways and a proinflammatory/oxidative environment.This systematic review provides an updated gene list and novel causal networks for idiopathic urolithiasis risk. Although some genes such as SPP1, CASR, VDR, CLDN14, and SLC34A1 were identified by several studies and recognized by prior reviews, further investigation elucidating their roles in stone formation will be essential for future studies.In this review, we summarized recent literature regarding genes responsible for kidney stone risk. Based on a detailed review of 30 articles and computational network analysis, we concluded that disorder of mineral regulation with local inflammation in the kidney may cause kidney stone disease."
"ESPN"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Alport syndrome (AS) is a rare hereditary disease that presents with chronic kidney disease and sensorineural hearing loss, and is diagnosed by its clinical features, pathological features on renal tissue, and mode of inheritance. We report a woman in her 20 s who exhibited persistent haematuria with normal renal function and sensorineural hearing loss. Her family members exhibited the same clinical findings among three generations and were suspected of having autosomal dominant AS (ADAS). Renal biopsy showed minor glomerular abnormalities on light microscopy and extensive thinning of the glomerular basement membrane on electron microscopy. Whole-exome analysis revealed a known COL4A4 (type IV collagen α4) mutation (c. 2510 G &gt; C: p. Gly837Ala). Two pedigrees with the same variant have been reported previously, one as ADAS and the other as autosomal recessive AS. However, these two cases exhibited no sensorineural hearing loss. The analysis in the present case revealed another missense variant in ESPN (Espin), an actin-bundling protein, which is a causative gene for sensorineural hearing loss. Although the pathophysiological significance of this novel missense variant needs to be clarified, computational analysis predicted that the variant creates a new phosphorylation site for protein kinase C. Our case suggests a possible association of hereditary sensorineural hearing loss with ADAS. Whole-exome analysis should be considered to diagnose hereditary and multiple-organ disorders."	"In 1998, a survey of the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) revealed substantial disparities in pediatric renal care among European countries. Therefore, ESPN aimed at harmonizing renal care in all European countries in the following 20 years. In 2017, we conducted a survey to evaluate the current status of renal health policies for children in Europe.A 33-question web-based survey was designed and sent to presidents or representatives of national societies of pediatric nephrology in 44 European countries.Data was reported from 42 (95.5%) countries. The number of pediatric nephrologists per million child population increased from 1998 to 2017 in 70% of countries. Pediatric dialysis facilities for acute kidney injury and end-stage kidney disease were available in 95% of countries. The availability of pediatric kidney transplantation increased from 55 to 93% of countries. Considerable variation was found in the current availability of allied health professionals, including psychosocial and nutritional support, high-tech diagnostic methods, and treatment with expensive drugs for children with kidney diseases between different European countries.The 20-year follow-up analysis of pediatric renal care services in European countries revealed that pediatric nephrology has become a well-established subspecialty in pediatrics and nephrology in 2017. The ESPN will continue its efforts to further improve pediatric renal care for European children by harmonizing remaining disparities of renal care services."	"Usher syndrome is the most common condition of combined blindness and deafness and is classified into three types (USH1‑USH3). USH2 is the most commonly diagnosed of all Usher syndrome cases. There are three identified proteins (usherin, GPR98 and whirlin) that form the USH2 complex. Defects in any of these proteins may cause failure in the formation of the USH2 complex, which is the primary cause of USH2. Whirlin is a scaffold protein and is essential for the assembly of the USH2 protein complex. It has been reported that espin is an interacting partner protein for whirlin. However, which fragment of whirlin interacts with espin remains unclear. In the present study, whirlin N‑ and C‑terminal fragments in the pEGFP‑C2 vectors were constructed. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into COS‑7 cells to observe the co‑localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The interactions between whirlin and espin were investigated by co‑immunoprecipitation using the 293 cell line. It was demonstated that only the whirlin N‑terminal fragment was able to interact with espin and the PR (proline‑rich) region in whirlin may be important for the interaction. However, the present study did not investigate the interaction between whirlin and espin without the PR domain which warrants future research. Our findings elucidated a primary mechanism of interaction between whirlin and espin, which are crucial for further study on the USH2 complex and USH2 pathogenesis."	"This article summarizes the ERA-EDTA Registry's 2016 Annual Report, by describing the epidemiology of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2016 within 36 countries.In 2017 and 2018, the ERA-EDTA Registry received data on patients undergoing RRT for ESRD in 2016 from 52 national or regional renal registries. In all, 32 registries provided individual patient data and 20 provided aggregated data. The incidence and prevalence of RRT and the survival probabilities of these patients were determined.In 2016, the incidence of RRT for ESRD was 121 per million population (pmp), ranging from 29 pmp in Ukraine to 251 pmp in Greece. Almost two-thirds of patients were men, over half were aged ≥65 years and almost a quarter had diabetes mellitus as their primary renal diagnosis. Treatment modality at the start of RRT was haemodialysis for 84% of patients. On 31 December 2016, the prevalence of RRT was 823 pmp, ranging from 188 pmp in Ukraine to 1906 pmp in Portugal. In 2016, the transplant rate was 32 pmp, varying from 3 pmp in Ukraine to 94 pmp in the Spanish region of Catalonia. For patients commencing RRT during 2007-11, the 5-year unadjusted patient survival probability on all RRT modalities combined was 50.5%. For 2016, the incidence and prevalence of RRT were higher among men (187  and 1381 pmp) than women (101 and 827 pmp), and men had a higher rate of kidney transplantation (59 pmp) compared with women (33 pmp). For patients starting dialysis and for patients receiving a kidney transplant during 2007-11, the adjusted patient survival probabilities appeared to be higher for women than for men."	"Genetic causes of hearing loss are highly heterogeneous and often ethnically specific. In recent years, a variety of next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels have been developed to target deafness-causative genes. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), on the other hand, was rarely used for genetic testing for deafness. In this study, we performed WES in 38 sporadic Chinese Han deaf patients who have been pre-excluded for mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4 and MT-RNR1. Non-synonymous variants have been filtered based on their minor allele frequencies in public databases and ethnically matched controls. Bi-allelic pathogenic mutations in eight deafness genes, OTOF, TRIOBP, ESPN, HARS2, CDH23, MYO7A, USH1C and TJP2, were identified in 10 patients, with 17 mutations identified in this study not being associated with deafness previously. For the rest 28 patients, possibly bi-allelic rare non-synonymous variants in an averaged 4.7 genes per patient were identified as candidate pathogenic causes for future analysis. Our study showed that WES may provide a unified platform for genetic testing of deafness and enables retro-analyzing when new causative genes are revealed."	"The best time to start chronic dialysis during the course of CKD stage 5 is controversial. The first randomised control trial of dialysis initiation either in early or late CKD stage 5 in adults (IDEAL study), and 3 studies from the two largest paediatric registries, the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) and the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) Registry, have now provided us with evidence to guide us in this important decision-making process. The message 'no benefit from early start of dialysis' is the conclusion from all four studies. However, what are the limitations of these studies? Can GFR be assessed at CKD stages 4 and 5? What are the factors used to assess the benefit of early or late start? These issues are discussed in this review."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Achieving normal growth is one of the most challenging problems in the management of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (GH) promotes longitudinal growth and likely enables children with CKD and short stature to reach normal adult height. Here, members of the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder (MBD), Dialysis and Transplantation working groups present clinical practice recommendations for the use of GH in children with CKD on dialysis and after renal transplantation. These recommendations have been developed with input from an external advisory group of paediatric endocrinologists, paediatric nephrologists and patient representatives. We recommend that children with stage 3-5 CKD or on dialysis should be candidates for GH therapy if they have persistent growth failure, defined as a height below the third percentile for age and sex and a height velocity below the twenty-fifth percentile, once other potentially treatable risk factors for growth failure have been adequately addressed and provided the child has growth potential. In children who have received a kidney transplant and fulfil the above growth criteria, we recommend initiation of GH therapy 1 year after transplantation if spontaneous catch-up growth does not occur and steroid-free immunosuppression is not a feasible option. GH should be given at dosages of 0.045-0.05 mg/kg per day by daily subcutaneous injections until the patient has reached their final height or until renal transplantation. In addition to providing treatment recommendations, a cost-effectiveness analysis is provided that might help guide decision-making."	"These recommendations were systematically developed on behalf of the Network for Early Onset Cystic Kidney Disease (NEOCYST) by an international group of experts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) from paediatric and adult nephrology, human genetics, paediatric radiology and ethics specialties together with patient representatives. They have been endorsed by the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA) and the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN). For asymptomatic minors at risk of ADPKD, ongoing surveillance (repeated screening for treatable disease manifestations without diagnostic testing) or immediate diagnostic screening are equally valid clinical approaches. Ultrasonography is the current radiological method of choice for screening. Sonographic detection of one or more cysts in an at-risk child is highly suggestive of ADPKD, but a negative scan cannot rule out ADPKD in childhood. Genetic testing is recommended for infants with very-early-onset symptomatic disease and for children with a negative family history and progressive disease. Children with a positive family history and either confirmed or unknown disease status should be monitored for hypertension (preferably by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) and albuminuria. Currently, vasopressin antagonists should not be offered routinely but off-label use can be considered in selected children. No consensus was reached on the use of statins, but mTOR inhibitors and somatostatin analogues are not recommended. Children with ADPKD should be strongly encouraged to achieve the low dietary salt intake that is recommended for all children."	"There is no consensus regarding the timing of dialysis therapy initiation for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in children. As studies investigating the association between timing of dialysis initiation and clinical outcomes are lacking, we aimed to study this relationship in a cohort of European children who started maintenance dialysis treatment.We used data on 2963 children from 21 different countries included in the European Society of Pediatric Nephrology/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry who started renal replacement therapy before 18 years of age between 2000 and 2014. We compared two groups according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at start: eGFR ≥8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (early starters) and eGFR &lt;8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (late starters). The primary outcomes were patient survival and access to transplantation. Secondary outcomes were growth and cardiovascular risk factors. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for selection- and lead time-bias.The median eGFR at the start of dialysis was 6.1 for late versus 10.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 for early starters. Early starters were older [median: 11.0, interquartile range (IQR): 5.7-14.5 versus 9.4, IQR: 2.6-14.1 years]. There were no differences observed between the two groups in mortality and access to transplantation at 1, 2 and 5 years of follow-up. One-year evolution of height standard deviation scores was similar among the groups, whereas hypertension was more prevalent among late initiators. Sensitivity analyses resulted in similar findings.We found no evidence for a clinically relevant benefit of early start of dialysis in children with ESKD. Presence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, should be taken into account when deciding to initiate or postpone dialysis in children with ESKD, as this affects the survival."	"Improved management of growth impairment might have resulted in less growth retardation after pediatric kidney transplantation (KT) over time. We aimed to analyze recent longitudinal growth data after KT in comparison to previous eras, its determinants, and the association with transplant outcome in a large cohort of transplanted children using data from the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology/European Renal Association and European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry.A total of 3492 patients transplanted before 18 years from 1990 to 2012 were included. Height SD scores (SDS) were calculated using recent national or European growth charts. We used generalized equation models to estimate the prevalence of growth deficit and linear mixed models to calculate adjusted mean height SDS.Mean adjusted height post-KT was -1.77 SDS. Height SDS was within normal range in 55%, whereas 28% showed moderate, and 17% severe growth deficit. Girls were significantly shorter than boys, but catch-up growth by 5 years post-KT was observed in both boys and girls. Children &lt;6 years were shortest at KT and showed the greatest increase in height, whereas there was no catch-up growth in children transplanted &gt;12.Catch-up growth post-KT remains limited, height SDS did not improve over time, resulting in short stature in nearly half of transplanted children in Europe."	"There are three principle forms of vascular access available for the treatment of children with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) by haemodialysis: tunnelled catheters placed in a central vein (central venous lines, CVLs), arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) using prosthetic or biological material. Compared with the adult literature, there are few studies in children to provide evidence based guidelines for optimal vascular access type or its management and outcomes in children with ESKD.The European Society for Paediatric Nephrology Dialysis Working Group (ESPN Dialysis WG) have developed recommendations for the choice of access type, pre-operative evaluation, monitoring, and prevention and management of complications of different access types in children with ESKD.For adults with ESKD on haemodialysis, the principle of &quot;Fistula First&quot; has been key to changing the attitude to vascular access for haemodialysis. However, data from multiple observational studies and the International Paediatric Haemodialysis Network registry suggest that CVLs are associated with a significantly higher rate of infections and access dysfunction, and need for access replacement. Despite this, AVFs are used in only ∼25% of children on haemodialysis. It is important to provide the right access for the right patient at the right time in their life-course of renal replacement therapy, with an emphasis on venous preservation at all times. While AVFs may not be suitable in the very young or those with an anticipated short dialysis course before transplantation, many paediatric studies have shown that AVFs are superior to CVLs.Here we present clinical practice recommendations for AVFs and CVLs in children with ESKD. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system has been used to develop and GRADE the recommendations. In the absence of high quality evidence, the opinion of experts from the ESPN Dialysis WG is provided, but is clearly GRADE-ed as such and must be carefully considered by the treating physician, and adapted to local expertise and individual patient needs as appropriate."	"Primary FSGS is an important cause of ESRD in children. FSGS recurrence after kidney transplantation is associated with early graft loss. No guidelines for treatment of FSGS recurrence exist. We conducted a survey to gain insight into variation of treatment between centers.A survey was sent to all members of the ESPN on behalf of the &quot;Renal Transplantation&quot; and &quot;Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome&quot; working groups.Fifty-nine nephrologists from 31 countries responded, reporting 807 FSGS patients, with 241 (30%) FSGS recurrences after transplantation. Recurrence varied from 0% to 100% between respondents. Native nephrectomy before or during transplantation was performed, respectively, always (37%), never (39%), or on clinical indication (17%). Half of the respondents started preventive treatment before transplantation, using PF (n = 10); R (n = 4); PF or IA, plus R (n = 9); cyclosporine (n = 2); or unknown (n = 4). Immunosuppressive therapy for patients without known mutations consisted of a combination of steroids, tacrolimus/cyclosporine, and MMF, with or without IL-2R-blockade in, respectively, 61% and 86% of the respondents. Sixty-three percent applied a similar regimen to patients with known mutations. FSGS recurrence was treated with PF or IA, plus R by 66% of respondents; 54% observed no response. Complete remission in &gt;50% of patients was reported by 41% of the respondents.FSGS recurrence after transplantation is common, but varies greatly between centers. We found great variability in preventive and therapeutic treatment regimens. Future research should focus on predisposing factors, including biopsy findings and genetic mutations, and standardized treatment."	"The mutational spectrum of deafness in Indochina Peninsula, including Vietnam, remains mostly undetermined. This significantly hampers the progress toward establishing an effective genetic screening method and early customized rehabilitation modalities for hearing loss. In this study, we evaluated the genetic profile of severe-to-profound hearing loss in a Vietnamese pediatric population using a hierarchical genetic analysis protocol that screened 11 known deafness-causing variants, followed by massively parallel sequencing targeting 129 deafness-associated genes. Eighty-seven children with isolated severe-to-profound non-syndromic hearing loss without family history were included. The overall molecular diagnostic yield was estimated to be 31.7%. The mutational spectrum for severe-to-profound non-syndromic hearing loss in our Vietnamese population was unique: The most prevalent variants resided in the MYO15A gene (7.2%), followed by GJB2 (6.9%), MYO7A (5.5%), SLC26A4 (4.6%), TMC1 (1.8%), ESPN (1.8%), POU3F4 (1.8%), MYH14 (1.8%), EYA1 (1.8%), and MR-RNR1 (1.1%). The unique spectrum of causative genes in the Vietnamese deaf population was similar to that in the southern Chinese deaf population. It is our hope that the mutation spectrum provided here could aid in establishing an efficient protocol for genetic analysis of severe-to-profound hearing loss and a customized screening kit for the Vietnamese population."	"Increasing efforts have been made to reduce the incidence and severity of concussion in high-contact sports. Despite these efforts, a relative lack of knowledge is available regarding modulating factors affecting concussion injury.To analyze the potential influence of game characteristics and outcomes on concussion incidence and severity in professional football.Descriptive epidemiology study.PBS <i>Frontline</i> Concussion Watch was used to collect concussion injury data from regular-season games of 32 National Football League (NFL) teams from 2012 to 2015. Game characteristic variables such as rushing and passing attempts, turnovers, and margin of victory were collected from ESPN. Analysis included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, <i>t</i> tests, and correlation tests.Away teams demonstrated a significantly greater concussion incidence per game than home teams. Losing teams had a significantly greater concussion incidence per game than winning teams. Being both the away team and the losing team appeared to have an additive effect. The home-versus-away and win-versus-loss effects were significant for offensive but not defensive positions. Within individual positions, significantly greater concussion incidence was associated with tight ends, running backs, wide receivers, and cornerbacks. When running versus passing positions were compared, passing positions (wide receiver, tight end, cornerback, safety) had significantly greater concussion incidence. A total of 626 games were missed as a result of reported concussions. Away teams had significantly more games missed due to concussion when they lost. Play time did not significantly differ before or after concussion injury. Other game characteristic variables did not significantly affect concussion frequency or intensity.Position, game location, and game outcome affect concussion incidence for professional football players. In a subset of analyses, the number of games missed aligned with concussion incidence, but this appeared to be an imperfect measure. These findings highlight new factors that may modulate concussion incidence and merit further study on how they may influence concussion evaluation."	"ESPN (Espin), an actin filament-binding protein, plays an important role in regulating the organization, dimensions, dynamics, and signaling capacities of the actin filament-rich, microvillus-type specializations that mediate sensory transduction in various mechanosensory and chemosensory cells. Recent few studies show that ESPN regulates metastasis and cell proliferation in melanoma. However, the significance of ESPN in other cancers such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains largely unknown.Immunohistochemistry was performed in 169 patients with ESCC and correlated with clinicopathological features and survival. The functional role of ESPN in ESCC cells was determined by ESPN-mediated siRNA.Univariate analyses showed that high ESPN expression was associated with inferior overall survival (P = 0.005) and disease-free survival (P = 0.035). High ESPN expression was an independent prognosticator in multivariate analysis for overall survival (P = 0.009, hazard ratio = 1.688) and disease-free survival (P = 0.049, hazard ratio = 1.451). The 5-year overall survival rates were 30% and 54% in patients with high and low expression of ESPN, respectively. Inhibition of endogenous ESPN in ESCC cells decreased ESCC growth by reducing cell proliferating rates.High ESPN expression is independently associated with poor prognosis in patients with ESCC and downregulation of ESPN inhibits ESCC cell growth. Our results suggest that ESPN may be a novel therapeutic target for patients with ESCC."	"Current guidelines advocate use of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) over central venous catheter (CVC) for children starting hemodialysis (HD). European data on current practice, determinants of access choice and switches, patient survival, and access to transplantation are limited.We included incident patients from 18 European countries who started HD from 2000 to 2013 for whom vascular access type was reported to the ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics, logistic and Cox regression models, and cumulative incidence competing risk analysis.Three hundred ninety-three (55.1%) of 713 children started HD with a CVC and were more often females, younger, had more often an unknown diagnosis, glomerulonephritis, or vasculitis, and lower hemoglobin and height-SDS at HD initiation. AVF patients were 91% less likely to switch to a second access, and two-year patient survival was 99.6% (CVC, 97.2%). Children who started with an AVF were less likely to receive a living donor transplant (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16-0.54) and more likely to receive a deceased donor transplant (adjusted HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.17-1.93), even after excluding patients who died or were transplanted in the first 6 months.CVC remains the most frequent type of vascular access in European children commencing HD. Our results suggest that the choice for CVC is influenced by the time of referral, rapid onset of end-stage renal disease, young age, and an expected short time to transplantation. The role of vascular access type on the pattern between living and deceased donation in subsequent transplantation requires further study."	"Children with congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) commonly develop end stage renal failure in infancy and require dialysis, but little is known about the complications and outcomes of dialysis in these children.We conducted a retrospective case note review across members of the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology Dialysis Working Group to evaluate dialysis management, complications of dialysis, and outcomes in children with CNS.Eighty children (50% male) with CNS were identified form 17 centers over a 6-year period. Chronic dialysis was started in 44 (55%) children at a median age of 8 (interquartile range 4-14) months. Of these, 17 (39%) were on dialysis by the age of 6 months, 30 (68%) by 1 year, and 40 (91%) by 2 years. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) was the modality of choice in 93%, but 34% switched to hemodialysis (HD), largely due to catheter malfunction (n = 5) or peritonitis (n = 4). The peritonitis rate was 0.77 per patient-year. Weight and height SDS remained static after 6 months on dialysis. In the overall cohort, at final follow-up, 29 children were transplanted, 18 were still on dialysis (15 PD, 3 HD), 19 were in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD), and there were 14 deaths (8 on dialysis). Median time on chronic dialysis until transplantation was 9 (6-18) months, and the median age at transplantation was 22 (14-28) months.Infants with CNS on dialysis have a comparable mortality, peritonitis rate, growth, and time to transplantation as infants with other primary renal diseases reported in international registry data."	"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. The aim of this study was to clarify the genetic aetiology of nonsyndromic hearing loss in the Moravian-Silesian population of the Czech Republic.This study included 200 patients (93 males, 107 females, mean age 16.9 years, ranging from 4 months to 62 years) with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. We screened all patients for mutations in <i>GJB2</i> and the large deletion del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830). We performed further screening for additional genes (<i>SERPINB6</i>, <i>TMIE</i>, <i>COCH</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>KCNQ4</i>, and <i>GJB3</i>) with Sanger sequencing on a subset of patients that were negative for <i>GJB2</i> mutations.We detected biallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutations in 44 patients (22%). Among these patients, 63.6%, 9.1% and 2.3% exhibited homozygous c.35delG, p.Trp24*, and p.Met34Thr mutations, respectively. The remaining 25% of these patients exhibited compound heterozygous c.35delG, c.-23+1G&gt;A, p.Trp24*, p.Val37Ile, p.Met34Thr, p.Leu90Pro, c.235delC, c.313_326del14, p.Ser139Asn, and p.Gly147Leu mutations. We found a monoallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutation in 12 patients (6.6%). We found no pathogenic mutations in the other tested genes. <i>Conclusions:</i> One fifth of our cohort had deafness related to <i>GJB2</i> mutations. The del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830), <i>SERPINB6</i>, <i>TMIE</i>, <i>COCH</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>GJB3</i>, and <i>KCNQ4</i> mutations were infrequently associated with deafness in the Moravian-Silesian population. Therefore, we suggest that del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830) testing should be performed only when patients with deafness carry the monoallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutation."	NA
"ESRRB"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in embryonic stem cells may play an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency. The identification of stem cell-specific lincRNAs and their interacting partners will deepen our understanding of the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. We identified a lincRNA, LincQ, which is specifically expressed in embryonic stem cells and is regulated by core pluripotent transcription factors. It was rapidly downregulated during the differentiation process. Knockdown of LincQ in embryonic stem cells led to differentiation, downregulation of pluripotency-related genes, and upregulation of differentiation-related genes. We found that exon 1 of LincQ can specifically bind to Sox2. The Soxp region in Sox2, rather than the HMG domain, is responsible for LincQ binding. Importantly, the interaction between LincQ and Sox2 is required for the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and the transcription of pluripotency genes. Esrrb and Tfcp2l1 are key downstream targets of LincQ and Sox2, since overexpression of Esrrb and Tfcp2l1 can restore the loss of embryonic stem cell pluripotency that is induced by LincQ depletion. In summary, we found that LincQ specifically interacts with Sox2 and contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency, highlighting the critical role of lincRNA in the pluripotency regulatory network. © AlphaMed Press 2020 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study shows that the long intergenic noncoding RNA LincQ is critical for embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency maintenance. LincQ is highly expressed in ESCs and is downregulated during differentiation. Further, its inhibition leads to ESC differentiation. LincQ binds to Sox2 to regulate the transcription of pluripotency genes. Esrrb and Tfcp2l1 are the main downstream targets of LincQ/Sox2 that are involved in ESC maintenance."	"Trophoblasts are the first cell type to be specified during embryogenesis, and they are essential for placental morphogenesis and function. Trophoblast stem (TS) cells are the progenitor cells for all trophoblast lineages; control of TS cell differentiation into distinct trophoblast subtypes is not well understood. Mice lacking the transcription factor OVO-like 2 (OVOL2) fail to produce a functioning placenta, and die around embryonic day 10.5, suggesting that OVOL2 may be critical for trophoblast development. Therefore, our objective was to determine the role of OVOL2 in mouse TS cell fate. We found that OVOL2 was highly expressed in mouse placenta and differentiating TS cells. Placentas and TS cells lacking OVOL2 showed poor trophoblast differentiation potential, including increased expression of stem-state associated genes (<i>Eomes, Esrrb, Id2</i>) and decreased levels of differentiation-associated transcripts (<i>Gcm1</i>, <i>Tpbpa, Prl3b1, Syna</i>). Ectopic OVOL2 expression in TS cells elicited precocious differentiation. OVOL2 bound proximate to the gene encoding inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2), a dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein, and directly repressed its activity. Overexpression of ID2 was sufficient to reinforce the TS cell stem state. Our findings reveal a critical role of OVOL2 as a regulator of TS cell differentiation and placental development, in-part by coordinating repression of ID2."	"Clusters of enhancers, referred as to super-enhancers (SEs), control the expression of cell identity genes. The organisation of these clusters, and how they are remodelled upon developmental transitions remain poorly understood. Here, we report the existence of two types of enhancer units within SEs typified by distinctive CpG methylation dynamics in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that these units are either prone for decommissioning or remain constitutively active in epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), as further established in the peri-implantation epiblast in vivo. Mechanistically, we show a pivotal role for ESRRB in regulating the activity of ESC-specific enhancer units and propose that the developmentally regulated silencing of ESRRB triggers the selective inactivation of these units within SEs. Our study provides insights into the molecular events that follow the loss of ESRRB binding, and offers a mechanism by which the naive pluripotency transcriptional programme can be partially reset upon embryo implantation."	"In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), a core transcription factor (TF) network establishes the gene expression program necessary for pluripotency. To address how interactions between four key TFs contribute to <i>cis-</i>regulation in mouse ESCs, we assayed two massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) libraries composed of binding sites for SOX2, POU5F1 (OCT4), KLF4, and ESRRB. Comparisons between synthetic <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements and genomic sequences with comparable binding site configurations revealed some aspects of a regulatory grammar. The expression of synthetic elements is influenced by both the number and arrangement of binding sites. This grammar plays only a small role for genomic sequences, as the relative activities of genomic sequences are best explained by the predicted occupancy of binding sites, regardless of binding site identity and positioning. Our results suggest that the effects of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are influenced by the order and orientation of sites, but that in the genome the overall occupancy of TFs is the primary determinant of activity."	"LincRNAs enriched with high H3K4me1 and low H3K4me3 signals often have the enhancer-like features which are named as enhancer-associated lincRNAs (elincRNAs). ElincRNAs are considered to be indispensable for target gene transcription, which play important roles in development, signaling events, and even diseases. In this study, we developed a regularized regression model to identify elincRNAs by integrating the genomic, epigenomic, and regulatory data. Application of the proposed method to mouse ESCs reveals that besides the basic well-known epigenetic features H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, more specific epigenetic features, such as high DNA methylation, high H3K122ac, and H3K36me3 were contributed to mark elincRNAs with the best accuracy and precision. Finally, 3729 elincRNAs were identified in mouse ESCs. Furthermore, the elincRNAs and canonical lincRNAs exhibit distinct genomic features, and elincRNAs have the higher CGI enrichment and lower sequence conservation. Through the analysis of transcription regulation, we found that elincRNAs were significantly regulated by NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2 and ESRRB, and were involved in the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry controlling ES cell state Function enrichment analysis further discovered that elincRNAs tended to regulate specific embryonic development biological processes. These results indicated that these two types of lincRNAs had both specific epigenetic and transcriptional regulation mechanism and display distinct functional characters. In conclusion, we presented a credible computational model to prioritize novel elincRNAs, and depicted the atlas of elincRNAs in mouse ESCs, which would help dissect the function roles of lncRNAs during the mammalian development and diseases."	"Meniere's disease (MD) is a complex disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo attacks, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), tinnitus and aural fullness. MD has been attributed to an accumulation of endolymph in the cochlear duct. The diagnosis of MD is based on the phenomenological association of clinical symptoms and the demonstration of SNHL during the vertigo attacks. Several evidences support a genetic contribution to MD including differences in the prevalence according to the ethnic background and familial aggregation in European and Asian populations in multiplex families with autosomal dominant inheritance. The genetic underpinnings of MD may include some rare monogenic forms in isolated families and a polygenic contribution in most familial and sporadic cases. So, familial MD has been reported in 6-8% of sporadic cases and several genes have been described in single Familial MD including FAM136A, DTNA, PRKCB, SEMA3D and DPT, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Multiplex rare missense variants in OTOG gene have been reported in 33% of familial MD, suggesting multiallelic inheritance. Moreover, the genetic landscape of sporadic MD is more complex and it involves multiplex rare variants in several SNHL genes such as GJB2, USH1G, SLC26A4, ESRRB, and CLDN14 and axonal-guidance signalling genes such as NTN4 and NOX3. This review summarizes evidence to support a genetic contribution in MD and the start of deciphering the genetic architecture to design and develop a molecular map of MD."	"Hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder affecting approximately 360 million people worldwide and is among the most common sensorineural disorders. Here, we report a genetic analysis of seven large consanguineous families segregating prelingual sensorineural hearing loss. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed seven different pathogenic variants segregating with hearing loss in these families, three novel variants (c.1204G&gt;A, c.322G&gt;T, and c.5587C&gt;T) in <i>TMPRSS3, ESRRB,</i> and <i>OTOF</i>, and four previously reported variants (c.208C&gt;T, c.6371G&gt;A, c.226G&gt;A, and c.494C&gt;T) in <i>LRTOMT</i>, <i>MYO15A</i>, <i>KCNE1</i>, and <i>LHFPL5</i>, respectively<i>.</i> All identified variants had very low frequencies in the control databases and were predicted to have pathogenic effects on the encoded proteins. In addition to being familial, we also found intersibship locus heterogeneity in the evaluated families. The known pathogenic c.226C&gt;T variant identified in <i>KCNE1</i> only segregates with the hearing loss phenotype in a subset of affected members of the family GCNF21. This study further highlights the challenges of identifying disease-causing variants for highly heterogeneous disorders and reports the identification of three novel and four previously reported variants in seven known deafness genes."	"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)/basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer. We previously reported that a small molecule agonist ligand for the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRβ or ESRRB) has growth inhibitory and anti-mitotic activity in TNBC cell lines. In this study, we evaluate the association of ESRRB mRNA, copy number levels, and protein expression with demographic, clinicopathological, and gene expression features in breast tumor clinical specimens.ESRRB mRNA-level expression and clinical associations were analyzed using RNAseq data. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization determined ESRRB copy number in African-American and Caucasian women. Transcription factor activity was measured using promoter-reporter luciferase assays in TNBC cell lines. Semi-automatic quantification of immunohistochemistry measured ERRβ protein expression on a 150-patient tissue microarray series.ESRRB mRNA expression is significantly lower in TNBC/BLBC versus other breast cancer subtypes. There is no evidence of ESRRB copy number loss. ESRRB mRNA expression is correlated with the expression of genes associated with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, metabolic pathways, and deafness. These genes contain G/C-rich transcription factor binding motifs. The ESRRB message is alternatively spliced into three isoforms, which we show have different transcription factor activity in basal-like versus other TNBC cell lines. We further show that the ERRβ2 and ERRβsf isoforms are broadly expressed in breast tumors at the protein level.Decreased ESRRB mRNA expression and distinct patterns of ERRβ isoform subcellular localization and transcription factor activity are key features in TNBC/BLBC."	"Environmental pollution is increasingly considered an important factor involved in the obesity incidence. Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are important actors in the concept of DOHaD (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease), where epigenetic mechanisms play crucial roles. Bisphenol A (BPA), a monomer used in the manufacture of plastics and resins is one of the most studied obesogenic endocrine disruptor. Bisphenol S (BPS), a BPA substitute, has the same obesogenic properties, acting at low doses with a sex-specific effect following perinatal exposure. Since the liver is a major organ in regulating body lipid homeostasis, we investigated gene expression and DNA methylation under low-dose BPS exposure. The BPS obesogenic effect was associated with an increase of hepatic triglyceride content. These physiological disturbances were accompanied by genome-wide changes in gene expression (1366 genes significantly modified more than 1.5-fold). Gene ontology analysis revealed alteration of gene cascades involved in protein translation and complement regulation. It was associated with hepatic DNA hypomethylation in autosomes and hypermethylation in sex chromosomes. Although no systematic correlation has been found between gene repression and hypermethylation, several genes related to liver metabolism were either hypermethylated (Acsl4, Gpr40, Cel, Pparδ, Abca6, Ces3a, Sgms2) or hypomethylated (Soga1, Gpihbp1, Nr1d2, Mlxipl, Rps6kb2, Esrrb, Thra, Cidec). In specific cases (Hapln4, ApoA4, Cidec, genes involved in lipid metabolism and liver fibrosis) mRNA upregulation was associated with hypomethylation. In conclusion, we show for the first time wide disruptive physiological effects of low-dose of BPS, which raises the question of its harmlessness as an industrial substitute for BPA."	"The access of Transcription Factors (TFs) to their cognate DNA binding motifs requires a precise control over nucleosome positioning. This is especially important following DNA replication and during mitosis, both resulting in profound changes in nucleosome organization over TF binding regions. Using mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cells, we show that the TF CTCF displaces nucleosomes from its binding site and locally organizes large and phased nucleosomal arrays, not only in interphase steady-state but also immediately after replication and during mitosis. Correlative analyses suggest this is associated with fast gene reactivation following replication and mitosis. While regions bound by other TFs (Oct4/Sox2), display major rearrangement, the post-replication and mitotic nucleosome positioning activity of CTCF is not unique: Esrrb binding regions are also characterized by persistent nucleosome positioning. Therefore, selected TFs such as CTCF and Esrrb act as resilient TFs governing the inheritance of nucleosome positioning at regulatory regions throughout the cell-cycle."	"The oncogenic ability of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 gene, TCL1, has captured the attention in the field of prolymphocytic T-cell and B-cell chronic leukemias for more than two decades. However, the finding that TCL1 is also expressed in totipotent cells of the mouse preimplantation embryos and that it is among the 10 genes, including the transcription factors <i>Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Tbx3</i>, and <i>Esrrb</i>, that are required for maintaining the mitotic self-renewal state of embryonic stem cells, raises a great interest. In this review, we highlight newly acquired evidence pinpointing TCL1 as a crucial regulator of metabolic pathways that dictate somatic cell reprogramming toward pluripotency. In our opinion, this feature provides a relevant hint for reframing the role that this factor plays at early stages of mammalian embryo development and in tumorigenesis. Hence, the TCL1-dependent enhancement of serine/threonine AKT/PKB kinase activity favoring cell proliferation appears to be associated to the promotion of glucose transport and activation of glycolytic pathways. This is also consistent with the TCL1 ability to suppress mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption, downplaying the contribution of oxidative phosphorylation to energy metabolism. It thus appears that TCL1 masters the direction of energy metabolism toward the glycolytic pathway to meet a critical metabolic requirement that goes beyond the mere ATP production. For instance, the synthesis of glycolytic intermediates that are required for DNA synthesis likely represents the most pressing cellular need for both cleavage-stage embryos and rapidly proliferating tumor cells."	"Little is known about the role of TBX1 in post-otocyst stages of inner ear development. Here, we report on mice with a missense mutation of Tbx1 that are viable with fully developed but abnormally formed inner ears. Mutant mice are deaf due to an undeveloped stria vascularis and show vestibular dysfunction associated with abnormal semicircular canal formation. We show that TBX1 is expressed in endolymph-producing strial marginal cells and vestibular dark cells of the inner ear and is an upstream regulator of Esrrb, which previously was shown to control the developmental fate of these cells. We also show that TBX1 is expressed in sensory cells of the crista ampullaris, which may relate to the semicircular canal abnormalities observed in mutant mice. Inner ears of mutant embryos have a non-resorbed fusion plate in the posterior semicircular canal and a single ampulla connecting anterior and lateral canals. We hypothesize that the TBX1 missense mutation prevents binding with specific co-regulatory proteins. These findings reveal previously unknown functions of TBX1 during later stages of inner ear development."	"Unnatural monosaccharides such as azidosugars that can be metabolically incorporated into cellular glycans are currently used as a major tool for glycan imaging and glycoproteomic profiling. As a common practice to enhance membrane permeability and cellular uptake, the unnatural sugars are per-O-acetylated, which, however, can induce a long-overlooked side reaction, non-enzymatic S-glycosylation. Herein, we develop 1,3-di-esterified N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) as next-generation chemical reporters for metabolic glycan labeling. Both 1,3-di-O-acetylated GalNAz (1,3-Ac<sub>2</sub>GalNAz) and 1,3-di-O-propionylated GalNAz (1,3-Pr<sub>2</sub>GalNAz) exhibit high efficiency for labeling protein O-GlcNAcylation with no artificial S-glycosylation. Applying 1,3-Pr<sub>2</sub>GalNAz in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we identify ESRRB, a critical transcription factor for pluripotency, as an O-GlcNAcylated protein. We show that ESRRB O-GlcNAcylation is important for mESC self-renewal and pluripotency. Mechanistically, ESRRB is O-GlcNAcylated by O-GlcNAc transferase at serine 25, which stabilizes ESRRB, promotes its transcription activity and facilitates its interactions with two master pluripotency regulators, OCT4 and NANOG."	"Rotator cuff disease is a widespread musculoskeletal pathology and a major cause of shoulder pain. Studies on familial predisposition suggest that genetic plays a role in the pathogenesis of rotator cuff disease. Several genes are responsible for rotator cuff disease. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review on genetic association between rotator cuff disease and genes variations.A systematic review of the literature was performed, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase and Google Scholar databases were searched comprehensively using the keywords: &quot;Rotator cuff&quot;, &quot;Gene&quot;, &quot;Genetic&quot;, &quot;Predisposition&quot;, &quot;Single-nucleotide polymorphism&quot; and &quot;Genome-wide association&quot;.8 studies investigating genes variations associated with rotator cuff tears were included in this review. 6 studies were case-control studies on candidate genes and 2 studies were GWASs. A significant association between SNPs and rotator cuff disease was found for DEFB1, FGFR1, FGFR3, ESRRB, FGF10, MMP-1, TNC, FCRL3, SASH1, SAP30BP, rs71404070 located next to cadherin8. Contradictory results were reported for MMP-3.Further investigations are warranted to identify complete genetic profiles of rotator cuff disease and to clarify the complex interaction between genes, encoded proteins and environment. This may lead to individualized strategies for prevention and treatment of rotator cuff disease.Level IV, Systematic Review."	"Continuous, non-cell cycle-dependent expression of cyclin E is a characteristic feature of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We studied the 5' regulatory region of <i>Cyclin E</i>, also known as <i>Ccne1</i>, and identified binding sites for transcription factors of the naïve pluripotency network, including Esrrb, Klf4, and Tfcp2l1 within 1 kilobase upstream of the transcription start site. Luciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChiP-qPCR) study highlighted one binding site for Esrrb that is essential to transcriptional activity of the promoter region, and three binding sites for Klf4 and Tfcp2l1. Knockdown of Esrrb, Klf4, and Tfcp2l1 reduced <i>Cyclin E</i> expression whereas overexpression of Esrrb and Klf4 increased it, indicating a strong correlation between the expression level of these factors and that of cyclin E. We observed that cyclin E overexpression delays differentiation induced by Esrrb depletion, suggesting that cyclin E is an important target of Esrrb for differentiation blockade. We observed that mESCs express a low level of miR-15a and that transfection of a miR-15a mimic decreases <i>Cyclin E</i> mRNA level. These results lead to the conclusion that the high expression level of <i>Cyclin E</i> in mESCs can be attributed to transcriptional activation by Esrrb as well as to the absence of its negative regulator, miR-15a."	"This study was performed to investigate the effects of dietary inclusion of 20% rapeseed meal (RSM) as an alternative to soybean meal (SBM) in a three-month feeding experiment with growing finishing pigs. Dietary alteration affected growth performance, several carcass traits and transcriptional responses in the skeletal muscle, but did not affect measured meat quality traits. In general, pigs fed the RSM test diet exhibited reduced growth performance compared to pigs on SBM control diet. Significant transcriptional changes in the skeletal muscle of growing pigs fed RSM diet were likely the consequence of an increased amount of fiber and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids, and presence of bioactive phytochemicals, such as glucosinolates. RNAseq pipeline using Tophat2-Cuffdiff identified 57 upregulated and 63 downregulated genes in RSM compared to SBM pigs. Significantly enriched among downregulated pathways was p53-mediated signalling involved in cellular proliferation, while activation of negative growth regulators (IER5, KLF10, BTG2, KLF11, RETREG1, PRUNE2) in RSM fed pigs provided further evidence for reduced proliferation and increased cellular death, in accordance with the observed reduction in performance traits. Upregulation of well-known metabolic controllers (PDK4, UCP3, ESRRG and ESRRB), involved in energy homeostasis (glucose and lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function), suggested less available energy and nutrients in RSM pigs. Furthermore, several genes supported more pronounced proteolysis (ABTB1, OTUD1, PADI2, SPP1) and reduced protein synthesis (THBS1, HSF4, AP1S2) in RSM muscle tissue. In parallel, higher levels of NR4A3, PDK4 and FGF21, and a drop in adropin, ELOVL6 and CIDEC/FSP27 indicated increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, reflective of lower dressing percentage. Finally, pigs exposed to RSM showed greater expression level of genes responsive to oxidative stress, indicated by upregulation of GPX1, GPX2, and TXNIP."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Estrogen related receptor beta (Esrrb) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is required for self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, in the early post-implantation mouse embryo, Esrrb is specifically expressed in the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) and plays a crucial role in trophoblast development. Previous studies showed that Esrrb is also required to maintain trophoblast stem (TS) cells, the in vitro stem cell model of the early trophoblast lineage. In order to identify regulatory targets of Esrrb in vivo, we performed microarray analysis of Esrrb-null versus wild-type post-implantation ExE, and identified 30 genes down-regulated in Esrrb-mutants. Among them is Bmp4, which is produced by the ExE and known to be critical for primordial germ cell (PGC) specification in vivo. We further identified an enhancer region bound by Esrrb at the Bmp4 locus by performing Esrrb ChIP-seq and luciferase reporter assay using TS cells. Finally, we established a knockout mouse line in which the enhancer region was deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Both Esrrb-null embryos and enhancer knockout embryos expressed lower levels of Bmp4 in the ExE, and had reduced numbers of PGCs. These results suggested that Esrrb functions as an upstream factor of Bmp4 in the ExE, regulating proper PGC development in mice."	"CD44 is one of biomarkers of liver cancer stem cells (CSCs). The investigation of mechanism of CD44 translocation helps to uncover new molecular pathways participated in the regulation of various cellular processes in CSCs. In the present study, we observed the translocation of CD44 from cytoplasm to nuclear in the reprogramming process of C3A cells, full-length CD44 presented in the nucleus of liver iCSCs. CD44 was bound with importin β and transportin 1 in liver iCSCs. Inhibition of importin β transport leads to reduction of CD44 in the nucleus. Translocation of CD44 is also influenced by importin α. Besides, overexpression of naïve pluripotent genes, <i>KLF2</i>, <i>KLF5, DNMT3L, GBX2</i>, <i>ZFP42</i>, <i>ESRRB</i> and <i>DPPA4</i> were found in liver iCSCs. Inhibition of CD44 leads to the reduction of these naïve genes. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further identified nuclear CD44 bound to the promoter regions of naïve genes, <i>KLF2, KLF5,</i> and <i>ESRRB</i> functioned as transcriptional activators in liver iCSCs. Our present work provides new insight into the dynamic states and functions of CD44 in iCSCs."	"In this study mouse Leydig cell (MA-10) were treated with G-protein coupled membrane estrogen receptor antagonist (G-15; 10 nM). Cells were analyzed by Western blotting for expression of estrogen-related receptors (ERRα, β and γ), steroidogenic markers (lutropin receptor; LHR and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 3β-HSD) and lipid droplet markers (perilipin; PLIN and microtubule-associated protein 1 A/1B-light chain 3; LC3). Concomitantly, microscopic analyses by light microscope (immunofluorescent staining for lipid droplets, PLIN and LC3) as well as by electron microscope (for lipid droplet ultrastructure) were utilized. For analysis of cholesterol content, cAMP level and progesterone secretion, G-15, estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (ICI 182,780; 10 μM), 17β-estradiol (10 mM) and, bisphenol A (BPA; 10 nM) were used alone or in combinations. We revealed no changes in ERRs expression but alterations in ERRβ and γ localization in G-15-treated cells when compared to control. Partial translocation of ERRβ and γ from the cell nucleus to cytoplasm was observed. Decreased expression of LHR, 3β-HSD, PLIN and LC3 was detected. Moreover, in treated cells large lipid droplets and differences in their distribution were found. Very strong signal of co-localization for PLIN and LC3 was found in treated cells when compared to control. In ultrastructure of treated cells, degenerating lipid droplets and double membrane indicating on presence of lipophagosome were observed. We found, that only (i) BPA and G-15 did not effect on cholesterol content, (ii) BPA, G-15 and ICI did not effect on cAMP level and (iii) BPA, ICI alone and in combination, and BPA with G-15 did not modulate progesterone secretion. These findings showed complex and diverse estrogen effects on mouse Leydig cells at various steps of steroid hormone production (cholesterol storage, release and processing). Lipid homeostasis and metabolism in these cells were affected by endogenous and exogenous estrogen, interactions of receptors (GPER, ER and ERR) and GPER and ER antagonists."

"To study the genetic etiology of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) in a Chinese family and perform a literature review of OTOF mutations and cochlear implantation (CI).Sequential targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and CI was performed for the proband. Further, 50 DNA samples from unrelated families with nonsyndromic deafness were examined for frequency determination. The impact of OTOF mutations on hearing recovery after CI was assessed through the literature survey.In the proband, the targeted NGS panel revealed five suspected variants in four genes (OTOF, EYA4, PCDH15, and GIPC3), of which two mutations-c.5098G &gt; C (p.Glu1700Gln) and c.1702C &gt; T (p.Arg568Trp)-in the OTOF gene were found to be correlated with ANSD. The c.5098G &gt; C allele was identified in only one child from the 50 unrelated participants. The proband's hearing and speech abilities were restored 2 years after the surgery. Most ANSD patients (90.9%; 30/33) with OTOF mutations have acceptable surgical outcomes, as indicated by existing reports.Our results support the feasibility of CI for patients with ANSD and OTOF mutations, and this hypothesis was supported by the review of existing data. A larger number of cases studies is required to determine possible modifies on the prognosis of surgery."	"Recent studies have confirmed the utility of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), providing a remarkable opportunity to find variants in known disease genes, especially in genetically heterogeneous disorders such as hearing loss (HL).After excluding mutations in the most common autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL (ARNSHL) genes via Sanger sequencing and genetic linkage analysis, we performed NGS in the proband an Iranian family with ARNSHL. The NimbleGen sequence capture array captures codingsequences (CDSs) and 100 bp of the flanking sequence of 129 common deafness genes (cat# Oto-DA3). NGSwas performed on the IlluminaHiSeq2000. BWA, SAMtools, Picard, GATK, Variant Tools, ANNOVAR, and IGV were applied for Bioinformatics analyses. Data filtering with allele frequencies (&lt;5% in the 1000 Genomes Project and 5400 NHLBI exomes) and PolyPhen2/SIFTscores (&gt;0.95) prioritized 1indel (insertions/deletions) and 3 missense variants in this family. Eventually, Sanger sequencing, segregation pattern, the frequency in 50 healthy matched normal controls, and evolutionary conservation of amino acid residues revealed the pathogenic variant.We identified a novel missenseGIPC3 mutation, c.472G &gt; A (p.Glu158 Lys). The pathogenicity of GIPC3c.472G &gt; A was supported by its absence in the population databases and the healthy-matched controls.Sanger sequencing confirmed co-segregation of the mutation with HL.This study is the first report of the contribution of theGIPC3 gene to HL in the Iranian population.Targeted NGS allows easier detection of mutations in relatively uncommon deafness genes in families with ARNSHL."	"<i>BRCA2</i> loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) is frequently observed in <i>BRCA2</i>-mutated tumors, but its biallelic loss causes embryonic lethality in mice and inhibits proliferation of normal somatic cells. Therefore, it remains unclear how loss of BRCA2 contributes to tumorigenesis. One possibility is that mutation in potential genetic interactors of <i>BRCA2</i>, such as <i>TRP53</i>, is required for cell survival/proliferation in the absence of BRCA2. In this study, using an insertional mutagenesis screen in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we have identified <i>GIPC3</i> (GAIP-interacting protein C-terminus 3) as a <i>BRCA2</i> genetic interactor that contributes to survival of <i>Brca2</i>-null mESC. GIPC3 does not compensate for BRCA2 loss in the repair of double-strand breaks. Mass-spectrometric analysis resulted in the identification of G-protein signaling transducers, APPL1 and APPL2, as potential GIPC3-binding proteins. A mutant GIPC3 (His155Ala) that does not bind to APPL1/2 failed to rescue the lethality of <i>Brca2-null</i> mESC, suggesting that the cell viability by GIPC3 is mediated via APPL1/2. Finally, the physiological significance of GIPC3 as a genetic interactor of BRCA2 is supported by the observation that <i>Brca2</i>-null embryos with <i>Gipc3</i> overexpression are developmentally more advanced than their control littermates. Taken together, we have uncovered a novel role for <i>GIPC3</i> as a <i>BRCA2</i> genetic interactor."	"The spotted snakehead Channa punctatus is a seasonally breeding teleost widely distributed in the Indian subcontinent and economically important due to high nutritional value. The declining population of C. punctatus prompted us to focus on genetic regulation of its reproduction. The present study carried out de novo testicular transcriptome sequencing during the four reproductive phases and correlated differential expression of transcripts with various testicular events in C. punctatus. The Illumina paired-end sequencing of testicular transcriptome from resting, preparatory, spawning and postspawning phases generated 41.94, 47.51, 61.81 and 44.45 million reads, and 105526, 105169, 122964 and 106544 transcripts, respectively. Transcripts annotated using Rattus norvegicus reference protein sequences and classified under various subcategories of biological process, molecular function and cellular component showed that the majority of the subcategories had highest number of transcripts during spawning phase. In addition, analysis of transcripts exhibiting differential expression during the four phases revealed an appreciable increase in upregulated transcripts of biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, cytoskeleton organization, response to vitamin A, transcription and translation, regulation of angiogenesis and response to hypoxia during spermatogenically active phases. The study also identified significant differential expression of transcripts relevant to spermatogenesis (mgat3, nqo1, hes2, rgs4, cxcl2, alcam, agmat), steroidogenesis (star, tkt, gipc3), cell proliferation (eef1a2, btg3, pif1, myo16, grik3, trim39, plbd1), cytoskeletal organization (espn, wipf3, cd276), sperm development (klhl10, mast1, hspa1a, slc6a1, ros1, foxj1, hipk1), and sperm transport and motility (hint1, muc13). Analysis of functional annotation and differential expression of testicular transcripts depending on reproductive phases of C. punctatus helped in developing a comprehensive understanding on genetic regulation of spermatogenic and steroidogenic events in seasonally breeding teleosts. Our findings provide the basis for future investigation on the precise role of testicular genes in regulation of seasonal reproduction in male teleosts."	"For sounds of a given frequency, spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) with different thresholds and dynamic ranges collectively encode the wide range of audible sound pressures. Heterogeneity of synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and SGNs is an attractive candidate mechanism for generating complementary neural codes covering the entire dynamic range. Here, we quantified active zone (AZ) properties as a function of AZ position within mouse IHCs by combining patch clamp and imaging of presynaptic Ca(2+) influx and by immunohistochemistry. We report substantial AZ heterogeneity whereby the voltage of half-maximal activation of Ca(2+) influx ranged over ∼20 mV. Ca(2+) influx at AZs facing away from the ganglion activated at weaker depolarizations. Estimates of AZ size and Ca(2+) channel number were correlated and larger when AZs faced the ganglion. Disruption of the deafness gene GIPC3 in mice shifted the activation of presynaptic Ca(2+) influx to more hyperpolarized potentials and increased the spontaneous SGN discharge. Moreover, Gipc3 disruption enhanced Ca(2+) influx and exocytosis in IHCs, reversed the spatial gradient of maximal Ca(2+) influx in IHCs, and increased the maximal firing rate of SGNs at sound onset. We propose that IHCs diversify Ca(2+) channel properties among AZs and thereby contribute to decomposing auditory information into complementary representations in SGNs."	"The genetic heterogeneity of congenital hearing disorders makes molecular diagnosis expensive and time-consuming using conventional techniques such as Sanger sequencing of DNA. In order to design an appropriate strategy of molecular diagnosis in the Algerian population, we explored the diversity of the involved mutations by studying 65 families affected by autosomal recessive forms of nonsyndromic hearing impairment (DFNB forms), which are the most prevalent early onset forms. We first carried out a systematic screening for mutations in GJB2 and the recurrent p.(Arg34*) mutation in TMC1, which were found in 31 (47.7%) families and 1 (1.5%) family, respectively. We then performed whole exome sequencing in nine of the remaining families, and identified the causative mutations in all the patients analyzed, either in the homozygous state (eight families) or in the compound heterozygous state (one family): (c.709C&gt;T: p.(Arg237*)) and (c.2122C&gt;T: p.(Arg708*)) in OTOF, (c.1334T&gt;G: p.(Leu445Trp)) in SLC26A4, (c.764T&gt;A: p.(Met255Lys)) in GIPC3, (c.518T&gt;A: p.(Cys173Ser)) in LHFPL5, (c.5336T&gt;C: p.(Leu1779Pro)) in MYO15A, (c.1807G&gt;T: p.(Val603Phe)) in OTOA, (c.6080dup: p.(Asn2027Lys*9)) in PTPRQ, and (c.6017del: p.(Gly2006Alafs*13); c.7188_7189ins14: p.(Val2397Leufs*2)) in GPR98. Notably, 7 of these 10 mutations affecting 8 different genes had not been reported previously. These results highlight for the first time the genetic heterogeneity of the early onset forms of nonsyndromic deafness in Algerian families. "	"With homozygosity mapping we have identified two large homozygous regions on chromosome 3q13.11-q13.31 and chromosome 19p13.3-q31.32 in a large Pakistani family suffering from autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (arNSHI). The region on chromosome 19 overlaps with the previously described deafness loci DFNB15, DFNB72 and DFNB95. Mutations in GIPC3 have been shown to underlie the nonsyndromic hearing impairment linked to these loci. Sequence analysis of all exons and exon-intron boundaries of GIPC3 revealed a homozygous canonical splice site mutation, c.226-1G&gt;T, in GIPC3. This is the first mutation described in GIPC3 that affects splicing. The c.226-1G&gt;T mutation is located in the acceptor splice site of intron 1 and is predicted to affect the normal splicing of exon 2. With a minigene assay it was shown to result in the use of an alternative acceptor site in exon 2, resulting in a frameshift and a premature stop codon. This study expands the mutational spectrum of GIPC3 in arNSHI. "	"GIPC1, GIPC2 and GIPC3 consist of GIPC homology 1 (GH1) domain, PDZ domain and GH2 domain. The regions around the GH1 and GH2 domains of GIPC1 are involved in dimerization and interaction with myosin VI (MYO6), respectively. The PDZ domain of GIPC1 is involved in interactions with transmembrane proteins [IGF1R, NTRK1, ADRB1, DRD2, TGFβR3 (transforming growth factorβ receptor type III), SDC4, SEMA4C, LRP1, NRP1, GLUT1, integrin α5 and VANGL2], cytosolic signaling regulators (APPL1 and RGS19) and viral proteins (HBc and HPV-18 E6). GIPC1 is an adaptor protein with dimerizing ability that loads PDZ ligands as cargoes for MYO6-dependent endosomal trafficking. GIPC1 is required for cell-surface expression of IGF1R and TGFβR3. GIPC1 is also required for integrin recycling during cell migration, angiogenesis and cytokinesis. On early endosomes, GIPC1 assembles receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and APPL1 for activation of PI3K-AKT signaling, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and RGS19 for attenuation of inhibitory Gα signaling. GIPC1 upregulation in breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers promotes tumor proliferation and invasion, whereas GIPC1 downregulation in cervical cancer with human papillomavirus type 18 infection leads to resistance to cytostatic transforming growth factorβ signaling. GIPC2 is downregulated in acute lymphocytic leukemia owing to epigenetic silencing, while Gipc2 is upregulated in estrogen-induced mammary tumors. Somatic mutations of GIPC2 occur in malignant melanoma, and colorectal and ovarian cancers. Germ-line mutations of the GIPC3 or MYO6 gene cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. As GIPC proteins are involved in trafficking, signaling and recycling of RTKs, GPCRs, integrins and other transmembrane proteins, dysregulation of GIPCs results in human pathologies, such as cancer and hereditary deafness."	"Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders in humans and has a genetic cause in 50% of the cases. Our recent studies indicate that nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in the Saudi Arabian population is genetically heterogeneous and is not caused by mutations in GJB2 and GJB6, the most common genes for deafness in various populations worldwide. Identification of the causative gene/mutation in affected families is difficult due to extreme genetic heterogeneity and lack of phenotypic variability. We utilized an SNP array-based whole-genome homozygosity mapping approach in search of the causative gene, for the phenotype in a consanguineous Saudi family, with five affected individuals presenting severe to profound congenital NSHL. A single shared block of homozygosity was identified on chromosome 19p13.3 encompassing GIPC3, a recently identified hearing loss gene. Subsequently, a novel mutation c.122 C&gt;A (p.T41K) in GIPC3 was found. This is the first report of GIPC3 mutation in a Saudi family. The presence of the GIPC3 mutations in only one of 100 Saudi families with congenital NSHL suggests that it appears to be a rare cause of familial or sporadic deafness in this population."	"Identification of the pathogenic mutations underlying autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is difficult, since causative mutations in 39 different genes have so far been reported. After excluding mutations in the most common ARNSHL gene, GJB2, via Sanger sequencing, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 30 individuals from 20 unrelated multiplex consanguineous families with ARNSHL. Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb kits and an Illumina Hiseq2000 instrument were used. An average of 93%, 84% and 73% of bases were covered to 1X, 10X and 20X within the ARNSHL-related coding RefSeq exons, respectively. Uncovered regions with WES included those that are not targeted by the exome capture kit and regions with high GC content. Twelve homozygous mutations in known deafness genes, of which eight are novel, were identified in 12 families: MYO15A-p.Q1425X, -p.S1481P, -p.A1551D; LOXHD1-p.R1494X, -p.E955X; GIPC3-p.H170N; ILDR1-p.Q274X; MYO7A-p.G2163S; TECTA-p.Y1737C; TMC1-p.S530X; TMPRSS3-p.F13Lfs*10; TRIOBP-p.R785Sfs*50. Each mutation was within a homozygous run documented via WES. Sanger sequencing confirmed co-segregation of the mutation with deafness in each family. Four rare heterozygous variants, predicted to be pathogenic, in known deafness genes were detected in 12 families where homozygous causative variants were already identified. Six heterozygous variants that had similar characteristics to those abovementioned variants were present in 15 ethnically-matched individuals with normal hearing. Our results show that rare causative mutations in known ARNSHL genes can be reliably identified via WES. The excess of heterozygous variants should be considered during search for causative mutations in ARNSHL genes, especially in small-sized families."	"Schistosomiasis is a serious global health problem that afflicts more than 230 million people in 77 countries. Long-term mass treatments with the only available drug, praziquantel, have caused growing concerns about drug resistance. PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins are recognized as potential targets for the next generation of drug development. However, the PDZ domain-containing protein family in parasites has largely been unexplored.We present the molecular characteristics of a PDZ domain-containing protein, GIPC3, from Schistosoma japonicum (SjGIPC3) according to bioinformatics analysis and experimental approaches. The ligand binding specificity of the PDZ domain of SjGIPC3 was confirmed by screening an arbitrary peptide library in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. The native ligand candidates were predicted by Tailfit software based on the C-terminal binding specificity, and further validated by Y2H assays.SjGIPC3 is a single PDZ domain-containing protein comprised of 328 amino acid residues. Structural prediction revealed that a conserved PDZ domain was presented in the middle region of the protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SjGIPC3 and other trematode orthologues clustered into a well-defined cluster but were distinguishable from those of other phyla. Transcriptional analysis by quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the SjGIPC3 gene was relatively highly expressed in the stages within the host, especially in male adult worms. By using Y2H assays to screen an arbitrary peptide library, we confirmed the C-terminal binding specificity of the SjGIPC3-PDZ domain, which could be deduced as a consensus sequence, -[SDEC]-[STIL]-[HSNQDE]-[VIL]*. Furthermore, six proteins were predicted to be native ligand candidates of SjGIPC3 based on the C-terminal binding properties and other biological information; four of these were confirmed to be potential ligands using the Y2H system.In this study, we first characterized a PDZ domain-containing protein GIPC3 in S. japonicum. The SjGIPC3-PDZ domain is able to bind both type I and II ligand C-terminal motifs. The identification of native ligand will help reveal the potential biological function of SjGIPC3. These data will facilitate the identification of novel drug targets against S. japonicum infections."	"Whole exome sequencing provides unprecedented opportunities to identify causative DNA variants in rare Mendelian disorders. Finding the responsible mutation via traditional methods in families with hearing loss is difficult due to a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. In this study we combined autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing in a family with 3 affected children having nonsyndromic hearing loss born to consanguineous parents. Two novel missense homozygous variants, c.508C&gt;A (p.H170N) in GIPC3 and c.1328C&gt;T (p.T443M) in ZNF57, were identified in the same ∼6 Mb autozygous region on chromosome 19 in affected members of the family. Both variants co-segregated with the phenotype and were absent in 335 ethnicity-matched controls. Biallelic GIPC3 mutations have recently been reported to cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Thus we conclude that the hearing loss in the family described in this report is caused by a novel missense mutation in GIPC3. Identified variant in GIPC3 had a low read depth, which was initially filtered out during the analysis leaving ZNF57 as the only potential causative gene. This study highlights some of the challenges in the analyses of whole exome data in the bid to establish the true causative variant in Mendelian disease."	"A missense mutation of Gipc3 was previously reported to cause age-related hearing loss in mice. Point mutations of human GIPC3 were found in two small families, but association with hearing loss was not statistically significant. Here, we describe one frameshift and six missense mutations in GIPC3 cosegregating with DFNB72 hearing loss in six large families that support statistically significant evidence for genetic linkage. However, GIPC3 is not the only nonsyndromic hearing impairment gene in this region; no GIPC3 mutations were found in a family cosegregating hearing loss with markers of chromosome 19p. Haplotype analysis excluded GIPC3 from the obligate linkage interval in this family and defined a novel locus spanning 4.08 Mb and 104 genes. This closely linked but distinct nonsyndromic hearing loss locus was designated DFNB81."	"Studies using inbred strains of mice have been invaluable for identifying alleles that adversely affect hearing. However, the efficacy of those studies is limited by the phenotypes that these strains express and the alleles that they segregate. Here, by selectively breeding phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous NIH Swiss mice, we generated two lines-the all-frequency hearing loss (AFHL) line and the high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) line-with differential hearing loss. The AFHL line exhibited characteristics typical of severe, early-onset, sensorineural hearing impairment. In contrast, the HFHL line expressed a novel early-onset, mildly progressive, and frequency-specific sensorineural hearing loss. By quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analyses in these two lines, we identified QTLs on chromosomes 7, 8, and 10 that significantly affected hearing function. The loci on chromosomes 7 and 8 (Hfhl1 and Hfhl2, respectively) are novel and appear to adversely affect only high frequencies (≥30 kHz). Mice homozygous for NIH Swiss alleles at either Hfhl1 or Hfhl2 have 32-kHz auditory-evoked brain stem response thresholds that are 8-14 dB SPL higher than the corresponding heterozygotes. DNA sequence analyses suggest that both the Cdh23(ahl) and Gipc3(ahl5) variants contribute to the chromosome 10 QTL detected in the AFHL line. The frequency-specific hearing loss indicates that the Hfhl1 and Hfhl2 alleles may affect tonotopic development. In addition, dissecting the underlying complex genetics of high-frequency hearing loss may prove relevant in identifying less severe and common forms of hearing impairment in the human population."	"Sensorineural hearing loss affects the quality of life and communication of millions of people, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify mutations in Gipc3 underlying progressive sensorineural hearing loss (age-related hearing loss 5, ahl5) and audiogenic seizures (juvenile audiogenic monogenic seizure 1, jams1) in mice and autosomal recessive deafness DFNB15 and DFNB95 in humans. Gipc3 localizes to inner ear sensory hair cells and spiral ganglion. A missense mutation in the PDZ domain has an attenuating effect on mechanotransduction and the acquisition of mature inner hair cell potassium currents. Magnitude and temporal progression of wave I amplitude of afferent neurons correlate with susceptibility and resistance to audiogenic seizures. The Gipc3(343A) allele disrupts the structure of the stereocilia bundle and affects long-term function of auditory hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Our study suggests a pivotal role of Gipc3 in acoustic signal acquisition and propagation in cochlear hair cells."	"The biological functions of some orthologs within the human genome and model-animal genomes are evolutionarily conserved, but those of others are divergent due to protein evolution and promoter evolution. Because WNT signaling molecules play key roles during embryogenesis, tissue regeneration and carcinogenesis, the author's group has carried out a human WNT-ome project for the comprehensive characterization of human genes encoding WNT signaling molecules. From 1996 to 2002, we cloned and characterized WNT2B/WNT13, WNT3, WNT3A, WNT5B, WNT6, WNT7B, WNT8A, WNT8B, WNT9A/WNT14, WNT9B/WNT14B, WNT10A, WNT10B, WNT11, FZD1, FZD2, FZD3, FZD4, FZD5, FZD6, FZD7, FZD8, FZD10, FRAT1, FRAT2, NKD1, NKD2, VANGL1, RHOU/ARHU, RHOV/ARHV, GIPC2, GIPC3, FBXW11/betaTRCP2, SOX17, TCF7L1/TCF3, and established a cDNA-PCR system for snap-shot and dynamic analyses on the WNT-transcriptome. In 2003, we identified and characterized PRICKLE1, PRICKLE2, DACT1/DAPPER1, DACT2/DAPPER2, DAAM2, and BCL9L. After completion of the human WNT-ome project, we have been working on the stem cell signaling network. WNT signals are transduced to beta-catenin, NLK, NFAT, PKC, JNK and RhoA signaling cascades. FGF20, JAG1 and DKK1 are target genes of the WNT-beta-catenin signaling cascade. Cross-talk of WNT and FGF signaling pathways potentiates beta-catenin and NFAT signaling cascades. BMP signals induce IHH upregulation in co-operation with RUNX. Hedgehog signals induce upregulation of SFRP1, JAG2 and FOXL1, and then FOXL1 induces BMP4 upregulation. The balance between WNT-FGF-Notch and BMP-Hedgehog signaling networks is important for the maintenance of homoestasis among stem and progenitor cells. Disruption of the stem cell signaling network results in pathological conditions, such as congenital diseases and cancer."	"WNT signals are transduced through seven-transmembrane-type WNT receptors encoded by Frizzled (FZD) genes to the beta-catenin - TCF pathway, the JNK pathway or the Ca2+-releasing pathway. WNT signaling molecules are potent targets for diagnosis of cancer (susceptibility, metastasis, and prognosis), for prevention and treatment of cancer, and for regenerative medicine or tissue engineering. We have so far cloned and characterized human WNT signaling molecules WNT2B/WNT13, WNT3, WNT3A, WNT5B, WNT6, WNT7B, WNT8A, WNT8B, WNT10A, WNT10B, WNT11, WNT14, WNT14B/WNT15, FZD1, FZD2, FZD3, FZD4, FZD5, FZD6, FZD7, FZD8, FZD10, FRAT1, FRAT2, NKD1, NKD2, VANGL1/STB2, ARHU/WRCH1, ARHV/WRCH2, GIPC2, GIPC3, betaTRCP2/FBXW1B, SOX17, and TCF-3 using bioinformatics, cDNA-library screening, and cDNA-PCR. Here, expression of WNT7A in human normal tissues and cancer, and regulation of WNT7A and WNT7B in human cancer were investigated. WNT7A was highly expressed in fetal lung, adult testis, lymph node, and peripheral blood leukocytes. WNT7A was relatively highly expressed in temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, paracentral gyrus of cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, medulla oblongata and putamen within adult brain. WNT7A was highly expressed in SW480 (colorectal cancer), BxPC-3 and Hs766T (pancreatic cancer), and was also expressed in MKN7 and MKN45 (gastric cancer). WNT7B rather than WNT7A was expressed in MCF-7 (breast cancer) and NT2 (embryonal tumor). beta-estradiol did not affect expression levels of WNT7A and WNT7B in MCF-7 cells. WNT7B, but not WNT7A, was slightly up-regulated by all-trans retinoic acid in NT2 cells."	"GIPC1/GIPC, GIPC2, and GIPC3 are a family of central PDZ-domain proteins. GIPC1/GIPC interacts with TGFbeta type III receptor, receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA, integrin alpha6A subunit, and GTPase-activating protein RGS-GAIP, while Xenopus homologue of human GIPCs interacts with Frizzled-3 (FZD3) class of WNT receptor. Here, we investigated expression of GIPC2 mRNA in human gastric, pancreatic, and breast cancer cell lines. GIPC2 mRNA was relatively highly expressed in OKAJIMA, TMK1, MKN45, and KATO-III cells derived from diffuse type of gastric cancer, but was almost undetectable in MKN7, MKN28, and MKN74 cells derived from intestinal type of gastric cancer as well as in other cell lines derived from pancreatic and breast cancer. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, which are elevated in gastric mucosa with Helicobacter pylori infection, did not affect the expression level of GIPC2 mRNA in MKN45 cells. Up-regulation of GIPC2 mRNA was detected in 7 out of 10 cases of primary gastric cancer by using cDNA-PCR, and in 4 out of another 8 cases of primary gastric cancer by using expression array filter hybridization. GIPC2 might play important roles in human gastric cancer through modulation of growth factor signaling or cell adhesion."	"GIPC1/GIPC/RGS19IP1, GIPC2, and GIPC3 genes constitute the human GIPC gene family. GIPC1 and GIPC2 show 62.0% total-amino-acid identity. GIPC1 and GIPC3 show 59.9% total-amino-acid identity. GIPC2 and GIPC3 show 55.3% total-amino-acid identity. GIPCs are proteins with central PDZ domain and GIPC homology (GH1 and GH2) domains. PDZ, GH1, and GH2 domains are conserved among human GIPCs, Xenopus GIPC/Kermit, and Drosophila GIPC/ LP09416. Bioinformatics revealed that GIPC genes are linked to prostanoid receptor genes and DNAJB genes in the human genome as follows: GIPC1 gene is linked to prostaglandin E receptor 1 (PTGER1) gene and DNAJB1 gene in human chromosome 19p13.2-p13.1 region; GIPC2 gene to prostaglandin F receptor (PTGFR) gene and DNAJB4 gene in human chromosome 1p31.1-p22.3 region; GIPC3 gene to thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) gene in human chromosome 19p13.3 region. GIPC1 and GIPC2 mRNAs are expressed together in OKAJIMA, TMK1, MKN45 and KATO-III cells derived from diffuse-type of gastric cancer, and are up-regulated in several cases of primary gastric cancer. PDZ domain of GIPC family proteins interact with Frizzled-3 (FZD3) class of WNT receptor, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1) receptor, receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA, TGF-beta type III receptor (TGF-beta RIII), integrin alpha6A subunit, transmembrane glycoprotein 5T4, and RGS19/RGS-GAIP. Because RGS19 is a member of the RGS family that regulate heterotrimeric G-protein signaling, GIPCs might be scaffold proteins linking heterotrimeric G-proteins to seven-transmembrane-type WNT receptor or to receptor tyrosine kinases. Therefore, GIPC1, GIPC2 and GIPC3 might play key roles in carcinogenesis and embryogenesis through modulation of growth factor signaling and cell adhesion."
"GRXCR1"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Postnatal mammalian cochlear hair cells (HCs) can be regenerated by direct transdifferentiation or by mitotic regeneration from supporting cells through many pathways, including Atoh1, Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch signaling. However, most new HCs are immature HCs. In this study we used RNA-Seq analysis to compare the differences between the transcriptomes of <i>Atoh1</i> overexpression-induced new HCs and the native HCs, and to define the factors that might help to promote the maturation of new HCs. As expected, we found <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had obvious HC characteristics as demonstrated by the expression of HC markers such as <i>Pou4f3</i> and Myosin VIIA (Myo7a). However, <i>Atoh1</i>-induced new HCs had significantly lower expression of genes that are related to HC function such as Slc26a5 (<i>Prestin</i>), <i>Slc17a8</i> and <i>Otof</i>. We found that genes related to HC cell differentiation and maturation (<i>Kcnma1</i>, <i>Myo6</i>, <i>Myo7a</i>, <i>Grxcr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Wnt5a</i>, <i>Fgfr1</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Fgf8</i> etc.) had significantly lower expression levels in new HCs compared to native HCs. In conclusion, we found a set of genes that might regulate the differentiation and maturation of new HCs, and these genes might serve as potential new therapeutic targets for functional HC regeneration and hearing recovery."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Morphogenesis and mechanoelectrical transduction of the hair cell mechanoreceptor depend on the correct assembly of Usher syndrome (USH) proteins into highly organized macromolecular complexes. Defects in these proteins lead to deafness and vestibular areflexia in USH patients. Mutations in a non-USH protein, glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine-rich 1 (GRXCR1), cause non-syndromic sensorineural deafness. To understand the deglutathionylating enzyme function of GRXCR1 in deafness, we generated two grxcr1 zebrafish mutant alleles. We found that hair bundles are thinner in homozygous grxcr1 mutants, similar to the USH1 mutants ush1c (Harmonin) and ush1ga (Sans). In vitro assays showed that glutathionylation promotes the interaction between Ush1c and Ush1ga and that Grxcr1 regulates mechanoreceptor development by preventing physical interaction between these proteins without affecting the assembly of another USH1 protein complex, the Ush1c-Cadherin23-Myosin7aa tripartite complex. By elucidating the molecular mechanism through which Grxcr1 functions, we also identify a mechanism that dynamically regulates the formation of Usher protein complexes."	"Hearing and balance depend upon the precise morphogenesis and mechanosensory function of stereocilia, the specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. Previous studies of Grxcr1 mutant mice indicated a critical role for this gene in control of stereocilia dimensions during development. In this study, we analyzed expression of the paralog Grxcr2 in the mouse and evaluated auditory and vestibular function of strains carrying targeted mutations of the gene. Peak expression of Grxcr2 occurs during early postnatal development of the inner ear and GRXCR2 is localized to stereocilia in both the cochlea and in vestibular organs. Homozygous Grxcr2 deletion mutants exhibit significant hearing loss by 3 weeks of age that is associated with developmental defects in stereocilia bundle orientation and organization. Despite these bundle defects, the mechanotransduction apparatus assembles in relatively normal fashion as determined by whole cell electrophysiological evaluation and FM1-43 uptake. Although Grxcr2 mutants do not exhibit overt vestibular dysfunction, evaluation of vestibular evoked potentials revealed subtle defects of the mutants in response to linear accelerations. In addition, reduced Grxcr2 expression in a hypomorphic mutant strain is associated with progressive hearing loss and bundle defects. The stereocilia localization of GRXCR2, together with the bundle pathologies observed in the mutants, indicate that GRXCR2 plays an intrinsic role in bundle orientation, organization, and sensory function in the inner ear during development and at maturity."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"We identified 2 patients in 1 family who had novel mutations in GRXCR1, which caused progressive hearing loss.One thousand one hundred twenty Japanese hearing loss patients with sensorineural hearing loss from unrelated families were enrolled in this study. Targeted genomic enrichment with massively parallel sequencing of all known nonsyndromic hearing loss genes was used to identify the genetic causes of hearing loss.In this study, 2 affected individuals with compound heterozygous mutations-c.439C&gt;T (p.R147C) and c.784C&gt;T (p.R262X)-in GRXCR1 were identified. The proband had moderate to severe hearing loss and suffered from dizziness with bilateral canal paralysis.Our cases are the first identified in the Japanese population and are consistent with previously reported cases. The frequency of mutations in GRXCR1 seems to be extremely rare. This study underscores the importance of using comprehensive genetic testing for hearing loss. Furthermore, longitudinal audiologic assessment and precise vestibular testing are necessary for a better understanding of the mechanisms of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction caused by GRXCR1 mutations."	"Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with mostly autosomal recessive inheritance. So far 40 genes and the same amount of loci with as yet unknown genes were described with autosomal recessive NSHL.A consanguineous Czech family with a child with NSHL was genotyped using SNP array and homozygous regions were compared with previously reported DFNB loci.GRXCR1 and ESRRB genes associated with autosomal recessive NSHL were located in two of the eight homozygous regions detected by SNP array genotyping. Mutation p.R291L in a homozygous state was found in the deaf child, the parents were heterozygous. The entire coding region of the ESRRB gene was sequenced in additional 39 patients of Czech origin with early NSHL and only two variants, p.V413I and p.P386S, were found in homozygous state, but are considered to be polymorphisms.Homozygosity mapping is a powerful method for identification of genes in heterogeneous recessive diseases. This is the first report of DFNB35 mutations in the Czech Republic and it seems to be a rare cause of NSHL. Additional mutations in ESRRB gene were reported in Pakistan, Tunisia and Turkey."	"Chloroplast movement in response to changing light conditions optimizes photosynthetic light absorption. This repositioning is stimulated by blue light perceived via the phototropin photoreceptors and is transduced to the actin cytoskeleton. Some actin-based motility systems use filament reorganizations rather than myosin-based translocations. Recent research favors the hypothesis that chloroplast movement is driven by actin reorganization at the plasma membrane, but no proteins affecting chloroplast movements have been shown to associate with both the plasma membrane and actin filaments in vivo. Here we identified THRUMIN1 as a critical link between phototropin photoreceptor activity at the plasma membrane and actin-dependent chloroplast movements. THRUMIN1 bundles filamentous actin in vitro, and it localizes to the plasma membrane and displays light- and phototropin-dependent localization to microfilaments in vivo. These results suggest that phototropin-induced actin bundling via THRUMIN1 is important for chloroplast movement. A mammalian homolog of THRUMIN1, GRXCR1, has been implicated in auditory responses and hair cell stereocilla development as a regulator of actin architecture. Studies of THRUMIN1 will help elucidate the function of this family of eukaryotic proteins."	"We identified overlapping homozygous regions within the DFNB25 locus in two Dutch and ten Pakistani families with sensorineural autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (arNSHI). Only one of the families, W98-053, was not consanguineous, and its sibship pointed toward a reduced critical region of 0.9 Mb. This region contained the GRXCR1 gene, and the orthologous mouse gene was described to be mutated in the pirouette (pi) mutant with resulting hearing loss and circling behavior. Sequence analysis of the GRXCR1 gene in hearing-impaired family members revealed splice-site mutations in two Dutch families and a missense and nonsense mutation, respectively, in two Pakistani families. The splice-site mutations are predicted to cause frameshifts and premature stop codons. In family W98-053, this could be confirmed by cDNA analysis. GRXCR1 is predicted to contain a GRX-like domain. GRX domains are involved in reversible S-glutathionylation of proteins and thereby in the modulation of activity and/or localization of these proteins. The missense mutation is located in this domain, whereas the nonsense and splice-site mutations may result in complete or partial absence of the GRX-like domain or of the complete protein. Hearing loss in patients with GRXCR1 mutations is congenital and is moderate to profound. Progression of the hearing loss was observed in family W98-053. Vestibular dysfunction was observed in some but not all affected individuals. Quantitative analysis of GRXCR1 transcripts in fetal and adult human tissues revealed a preferential expression of the gene in fetal cochlea, which may explain the nonsyndromic nature of the hearing impairment."	"Recessive mutations at the mouse pirouette (pi) locus result in hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction due to neuroepithelial defects in the inner ear. Using a positional cloning strategy, we have identified mutations in the gene Grxcr1 (glutaredoxin cysteine-rich 1) in five independent allelic strains of pirouette mice. We also provide sequence data of GRXCR1 from humans with profound hearing loss suggesting that pirouette is a model for studying the mechanism of nonsyndromic deafness DFNB25. Grxcr1 encodes a 290 amino acid protein that contains a region of similarity to glutaredoxin proteins and a cysteine-rich region at its C terminus. Grxcr1 is expressed in sensory epithelia of the inner ear, and its encoded protein is localized along the length of stereocilia, the actin-filament-rich mechanosensory structures at the apical surface of auditory and vestibular hair cells. The precise architecture of hair cell stereocilia is essential for normal hearing. Loss of function of Grxcr1 in homozygous pirouette mice results in abnormally thin and slightly shortened stereocilia. When overexpressed in transfected cells, GRXCR1 localizes along the length of actin-filament-rich structures at the dorsal-apical surface and induces structures with greater actin filament content and/or increased lengths in a subset of cells. Our results suggest that deafness in pirouette mutants is associated with loss of GRXCR1 function in modulating actin cytoskeletal architecture in the developing stereocilia of sensory hair cells."

"ILDR1"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) has recently been confirmed as a common complex trait, that is, it is heritable with many genetic variants each contributing a small amount of risk, as well as environmental determinants. Historically, attempts to identify the genetic variants underlying the ARHL have been of limited success, relying on the selection of candidate genes based on the limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of the condition, and linkage studies in samples comprising related individuals. More recently genome-wide association studies have been performed, but these require very large samples having consistent and reliable phenotyping for hearing loss (HL), and early attempts suffered from lack of reliable replication of their findings. Replicated variants shown associated with ARHL include those lying in genes GRM7, ISG20, TRIOBP, ILDR1, and EYA4. The availability of large biobanks and the development of collaborative consortia have led to a breakthrough over the last couple of years, and many new genetic variants associated with ARHL are becoming available, through the analysis publicly available bioresources and electronic health records. These findings along with immunohistochemistry and mouse models of HL look set to help disentangle the genetic architecture of ARHL, and highlight the need for standardization of phenotyping methods to facilitate data sharing and collaboration across research networks."	"Volume and composition of saliva are crucial for oral and systemic health. How substances, particularly macromolecules, are transported across the salivary gland epithelium has not been established in detail. Tricellulin is a component of tricellular tight junctions that form a central tube to serve as an important route for macromolecule transport. Whether tricellulin is expressed in the submandibular gland (SMG) and involved in salivation has been unknown. Here, by using Western blotting and immunofluorescence, tricellulin was found to be characteristically localized at tricellular contacts of human, rat, and mouse SMGs. Knockdown of tricellulin significantly increased, whereas overexpression of tricellulin decreased, paracellular permeability for 40-kDa but not for 4-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, while transepithelial electrical resistance was unaffected. Conversely, claudin-4 knockdown and overexpression affected transepithelial electrical resistance but not 40-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran transport, suggesting that tricellulin regulated transport of macromolecules but not ions, which were mainly regulated by bicellular tight junctions (bTJs). Moreover, tricellulin was dynamically redistributed from tri- to bicellular membranes in cholinergically stimulated SMG tissues and cells. Immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor 1 (ILDR1) recruits tricellulin to tricellular contacts. The proportion of macromolecules in the saliva was increased, whereas the amount of stimulated saliva was unchanged in <i>Ildr1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which displayed abnormal tricellulin distribution in SMGs. Furthermore, tricellulin interacted with bTJ proteins, such as occludin, claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-4, and ZO-1, in rat SMG epithelial polarized cell line SMG-C6. Knockdown of tricellulin decreased occludin levels. Thus, we revealed a specific expression pattern of tricellulin in SMG epithelium. Tricellulin not only functioned as a barrier for macromolecules but also modulated the connection of bTJs to the tight junction complex. Alterations in tricellulin expression and distribution could thereby change salivary composition. Our study provided novel insights on salivary gland tight junction organization and function."	"Previous research has shown that genes play a substantial role in determining a person's susceptibility to age-related hearing impairment. The existing studies on this subject have different results, which may be caused by difficulties in determining the phenotype or the limited number of participants involved. Here, we have gathered the largest sample to date (discovery n = 9,675; replication n = 10,963; validation n = 356,141), and examined phenotypes that represented low/mid and high frequency hearing loss on the pure tone audiogram. We identified 7 loci that were either replicated and/or validated, of which 5 loci are novel in hearing. Especially the ILDR1 gene is a high profile candidate, as it contains our top SNP, is a known hearing loss gene, has been linked to age-related hearing impairment before, and in addition is preferentially expressed within hair cells of the inner ear. By verifying all previously published SNPs, we can present a paper that combines all new and existing findings to date, giving a complete overview of the genetic architecture of age-related hearing impairment. This is of importance as age-related hearing impairment is highly prevalent in our ageing society and represents a large socio-economic burden."	"We previously identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at four susceptibility loci for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in individuals of European ancestry through a large genome-wide association study (GWAS). To further elucidate genetic susceptibility to DLBCL, we sought to validate two loci at 3q13.33 and 3p24.1 that were suggestive in the original GWAS with additional genotyping. In the meta-analysis (5662 cases and 9237 controls) of the four original GWAS discovery scans and three replication studies, the 3q13.33 locus (rs9831894; minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.40) was associated with DLBCL risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.83, P = 3.62 × 10-13]. rs9831894 is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with additional variants that are part of a super-enhancer that physically interacts with promoters of CD86 and ILDR1. In the meta-analysis (5510 cases and 12 817 controls) of the four GWAS discovery scans and four replication studies, the 3p24.1 locus (rs6773363; MAF = 0.45) was also associated with DLBCL risk (OR = 1.20, P = 2.31 × 10-12). This SNP is 29 426-bp upstream of the nearest gene EOMES and in LD with additional SNPs that are part of a highly lineage-specific and tumor-acquired super-enhancer that shows long-range interaction with AZI2 promoter. These loci provide additional evidence for the role of immune function in the etiology of DLBCL, the most common lymphoma subtype."	"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful approach to identify genomic regions and genetic variants associated with phenotypes. However, only limited mutual confirmation from different studies is available. We conducted a large-scale GWAS using 294,079 first-lactation Holstein cows and identified new additive and dominance effects on five production traits, three fertility traits, and somatic cell score. Four chromosomes had the most significant SNP effects on the five production traits, a Chr14 region containing <i>DGAT1</i> mostly had positive effects on fat yield and negative effects on milk and protein yields, the 88.07-89.60 Mb region of Chr06 with <i>SLC4A4, GC, NPFFR2</i>, and <i>ADAMTS3</i> for milk and protein yields, the 30.03-36.67 Mb region of Chr20 with <i>C6</i> and <i>GHR</i> for milk yield, and the 88.19-88.88 Mb region with <i>ABCC9</i> as well as the 91.13-94.62 Mb region of Chr05 with <i>PLEKHA5, MGST1, SLC15A5</i>, and <i>EPS8</i> for fat yield. For fertility traits, the SNP in <i>GC</i> of Chr06, and the SNPs in the 65.02-69.43 Mb region of Chr01 with <i>COX17, ILDR1</i>, and <i>KALRN</i> had the most significant effects for daughter pregnancy rate and cow conception rate, whereas SNPs in <i>AFF1</i> of Chr06, the 47.54-52.79 Mb region of Chr07, <i>TSPAN4</i> of Chr29, and <i>NPAS1</i> of Chr18 had the most significant effects for heifer conception rate. For somatic cell score, <i>GC</i> of Chr06 and <i>PRLR</i> of Chr20 had the most significant effects. A small number of dominance effects were detected for the production traits with far lower statistical significance than the additive effects and for fertility traits with similar statistical significance as the additive effects. Analysis of allelic effects revealed the presence of uni-allelic, asymmetric, and symmetric SNP effects and found the previously reported <i>DGAT1</i> antagonism was an extreme antagonistic pleiotropy between fat yield and milk and protein yields among all SNPs in this study."	"Hereditary hearing impairment is one of the major and common birth defects in Chinese population. Non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL) is the most common types of hereditary hearing impairment. Genotypically and phenotypically NSHL is extremely heterogenous and follow either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive or X-linked mode of inheritance. Presently, 127 genes have been identified to be associated with both syndromic and (NSHL). Here, we studied a Chinese family with moderate and profound hearing impairment. The proband is a 30-year old Chinese man. The proband was born with normal hearing and at the age of 5-years, the proband was first noticed with hearing impairment. Gradually and progressively the proband was presented with loss of hearing in his both right and left ears at the age of 30 years. The clinical symptoms, age of onset or progression to loss of hearing was similar in both the proband and his younger brother. The proband's parents are phenotypically normal and non-consanguineous. Clinical diagnosis of the proband and his younger brother has been done by classical pure tone audiogram (PTA). Computed Tomography (CT) found no abnormality in bilateral external ear, middle ear and inner ear. Targeted next generation sequencing was performed with a panel of 127 genes reported to be associated with hereditary hearing impairment. A novel homozygous single nucleotide deletion (c.427delT) in exon 4 of <i>ILDR1</i> gene has been identified in proband and in his younger brother. Sanger sequencing confirmed that proband's father and mother are carrying this mutation in a heterozygous manner. This mutation has not been identified in 100 normal healthy control individuals. This mutation (c.427delT) causes frameshift (p.Tyr143Ilefs<sup>∗</sup>19) which leads to the formation of a truncated ILDR1 protein of 162 amino acids instead of the wild type ILDR1 protein of 546 amino acids. <i>ILDR1</i> associated hereditary hearing impairment is very rare and this is the first report of identifying a <i>loss-of-function</i> mutation in <i>ILDR1</i> gene associated with hereditary hearing impairment in Chinese population. Our present study also emphasized the significance of rapid, accurate and cost-effective screening for the patient with hereditary hearing impairment by targeted next generation sequencing."	"Genetic hearing impairment is highly heterogeneous. In this study, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in two Chinese Han families identified a novel p.G141R homozygous mutation in <i>ILDR1</i> as the genetic cause of the deafness. Consistent with the recessive inheritance, cosegregation of the p.G141R variant with the hearing loss was confirmed in members of both families by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. SNP genotyping analysis suggested that those two families were not closely related. Our study showed that targeted NGS is an effective tool for diagnosis of genetic deafness and that p.G141R in <i>ILDR1</i> may be a relatively frequent mutation for DFNB42 in Chinese Hans."	"Hearing impairment is the most common sensorineural disorder and is genetically heterogeneous. Identification of the pathogenic mutations underlying hearing impairment is difficult, since causative mutations in 127 different genes have so far been reported.In this study, we performed Next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 2 individuals from a consanguineous family with hearing loss.Three novel mutations in known deafness genes were identified in the family; MYO6-p.R928C and -p.D1223N in heterozygous state and ILDR1-p.Y143C in homozygous state. Sanger sequencing confirmed co-segregation of the three mutations with deafness in the family. The identified mutation in ILDR1 gene is located in the immunoglobulin-type domain of the ILDR1 protein and the detected mutations in MY06 are located in the tail domain of the MYO6 protein. The mutations are predicted to be pathogenic by SIFT, PolyPhen and Mutation Taster.Our results suggest that either the homozygous ILDR1-p.Y143C mutation might be the pathogenic variant for ARNSHL or heterozygous MYO6- p.R928C, -p.D1223N might be involved in these patient's disorder due to compound heterozygousity. To our knowledge, this is the first ILDR1 and MYO6 mutations recognized in the southwest Iran. Our data expands the spectrum of mutations in ILDR1 and MYO6 genes."	"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss is one of the most common monogenic diseases. It is characterized by high allelic and locus heterogeneities that make a precise diagnosis difficult. In this study, whole-exome sequencing was performed for an affected patient allowing us to identify a new frameshift mutation (c.804delG) in the Immunoglobulin-Like Domain containing Receptor-1 (ILDR1) gene. Direct Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis were performed for the family pedigree. The mutation was homozygous in all affected siblings but heterozygous in the normal consanguineous parents. The present study reports a first ILDR1 gene mutation in the UAE population and confirms that the whole-exome sequencing approach is a robust tool for the diagnosis of monogenic diseases with high levels of allelic and locus heterogeneity. In addition, by reviewing all reported ILDR1 mutations, we attempt to establish a genotype phenotype correlation to explain the phenotypic variability observed at low frequencies."	"Angulin proteins are a group of evolutionally conserved type I transmembrane proteins that contain an extracellular Ig-like domain. In mammals, three angulin proteins have been identified, namely immunoglobulin-like domain containing receptor 1 (ILDR1), immunoglobulin-like domain containing receptor 2 (ILDR2), and lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR). All three proteins have been shown to localize at tight junctions (TJs) and are important for TJ formation. Mutations in ILDR1 gene have been shown to cause non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). In the present work, we show that ILDR1 binds to splicing factors TRA2A, TRA2B, and SRSF1, and translocates into the nuclei when the splicing factors are present. Moreover, ILDR1 affects alternative splicing of Tubulin delta 1 (TUBD1), IQ motif containing B1 (IQCB1), and Protocadherin 19 (Pcdh19). Further investigation show that ILDR2, but not LSR, also binds to the splicing factors and regulates alternative splicing. When endogenous ILDR1 and ILDR2 expression is knockdown with siRNAs in cultured cells, alternative splicing of TUBD1 and IQCB1 is affected. In conclusion, we show here that angulin proteins ILDR1 and ILDR2 are involved in alternative pre-mRNA splicing via binding to splicing factors TRA2A, TRA2B, or SRSF1."	"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common childhood rheumatic disease and has a strong genomic component. To date, JIA genetic association studies have had limited sample sizes, used heterogeneous patient populations, or included only candidate regions. The aim of this study was to identify new associations between JIA patients with oligoarticular disease and those with IgM rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarticular disease, which are clinically similar and the most prevalent JIA disease subtypes.Three cohorts comprising 2,751 patients with oligoarticular or RF-negative polyarticular JIA were genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0 or the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12+ Array. Overall, 15,886 local and out-of-study controls, typed on these platforms or the Illumina HumanOmni2.5, were used for association analyses. High-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used for imputation to 1000 Genomes prior to SNP association analysis.Meta-analysis showed evidence of association (P &lt; 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup> ) at 9 regions: PRR9_LOR (P = 5.12 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ), ILDR1_CD86 (P = 6.73 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ), WDFY4 (P = 1.79 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ), PTH1R (P = 1.87 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ), RNF215 (P = 3.09 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ), AHI1_LINC00271 (P = 3.48 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ), JAK1 (P = 4.18 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ), LINC00951 (P = 5.80 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ), and HBP1 (P = 7.29 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ). Of these, PRR9_LOR, ILDR1_CD86, RNF215, LINC00951, and HBP1 were shown, for the first time, to be autoimmune disease susceptibility loci. Furthermore, associated SNPs included cis expression quantitative trait loci for WDFY4, CCDC12, MTP18, SF3A1, AHI1, COG5, HBP1, and GPR22.This study provides evidence of both unique JIA risk loci and risk loci overlapping between JIA and other autoimmune diseases. These newly associated SNPs are shown to influence gene expression, and their bounding regions tie into molecular pathways of immunologic relevance. Thus, they likely represent regions that contribute to the pathology of oligoarticular JIA and RF-negative polyarticular JIA."	"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a heterogeneous family of hearing disabilities with congenital (including genetic) as well as acquired etiology. Congenital SNHL of genetic etiology is further sub-divided into autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked SNHL. More than 60 genes are involved in the etiology of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) commonly manifesting as heterogeneous pre-lingual profound to severe non-progressive clinical phenotype. <i>ILDR1</i>-dependent ARNSHL (DFNB42, OMIM: # 609646) is a very rare sub-type of hearing disability, with unknown prevalence, caused by function-damaging genetic variants in <i>ILDR1</i> gene reported in families of Middle-Eastern origin. <i>ILDR1</i> (Immunoglobulin-Like Domain-containing Receptor 1) is involved in the development of semicircular canal, tricellular tight junction and auditory hair cells. An apparently non-consanguineous family of European ancestry with two affected siblings with profound progressive hearing loss characterized in their infancy and successfully treated with cochlear implants (CI) is presented. Genetic analysis of common ARNSHL genetic causes in the population of origin was negative, thus the next-generation sequencing (NGS) and family segregation analysis to identify underlying causative genetic variant was performed. Unexpectedly and atypical for the population of origin a homozygous non-sense variant <i>ILDR1</i> c.942C &gt; A (p.Cys314Ter) inherited from both heterozygous parents was identified in both patients. Contrary to the commonly reported phenotype, indices of a progressive hearing loss and potential compensatory mechanism of vestibular function were revealed with the analysis of clinical data. The utilization of NGS was demonstrated as an invaluable tool for the detection of atypical rare variants in diagnostics of unidentified hearing loss disorders."	"Whether the tight junction is permeable to water remains highly controversial. Here, we provide evidence that the tricellular tight junction is important for paracellular water permeation and that Ig-like domain containing receptor 1 (ILDR1) regulates its permeability. In the mouse kidney, ILDR1 is localized to tricellular tight junctions of the distal tubules. Genetic knockout of <i>Ildr1</i> in the mouse kidney causes polyuria and polydipsia due to renal concentrating defects. Microperfusion of live renal distal tubules reveals that they are impermeable to water in normal animals but become highly permeable to water in <i>Ildr1</i> knockout animals whereas paracellular ionic permeabilities in the <i>Ildr1</i> knockout mouse renal tubules are not affected. Vasopressin cannot correct paracellular water loss in <i>Ildr1</i> knockout animals despite normal effects on the transcellular aquaporin-2-dependent pathway. In cultured renal epithelial cells normally lacking the expression of <i>Ildr1</i>, overexpression of <i>Ildr1</i> significantly reduces the paracellular water permeability. Together, our study provides a mechanism of how cells transport water and shows how such a mechanism may be exploited as a therapeutic approach to maintain water homeostasis."	"Steel syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by skeletal abnormalities and dysmorphic features. The first mutation associated with this syndrome was reported in Puerto Rican children. In this study, we identified a novel homozygous splice site variant in COL27A1 (c.3556-2A&gt;G) in a consanguineous Emirati family with a child affected by Steel syndrome. In addition, the affected child had severe non-progressive sensorineural hearing loss not reported previously. The variant segregated in the family in an autosomal recessive manner and we show that the variant alters mRNA splicing. Furthermore, relative quantitative analysis revealed a marked reduction in gene expression in the proposita compared to healthy controls. Segregation analysis of heterozygous variants, related to hearing loss, identified by whole exome sequencing in the child (ILDR1: c.1159T&gt;C, SYNE4: c.313G&gt;C, and GPR98: c.18746T&gt;G) excluded them from being responsible for the hearing loss in the proposita. In addition, the products of these genes are not interacting in the same pathway and have only been reported to cause deafness in an autosomal recessive manner. Therefore, we conclude that the novel splice-site variant identified in COL27A1 is the most likely cause for Steel syndrome in this family and that the hearing loss is part of this syndrome's phenotype."	"Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI), one of the most common sensory disorders, can be mitigated, but not cured or eliminated. To identify genetic influences underlying ARHI, we conducted a genome-wide association study of ARHI in 6,527 cases and 45,882 controls among the non-Hispanic whites from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We identified two novel genome-wide significant SNPs: rs4932196 (odds ratio = 1.185, p = 4.0x10-11), 52Kb 3' of ISG20, which replicated in a meta-analysis of the other GERA race/ethnicity groups (1,025 cases, 12,388 controls, p = 0.00094) and in a UK Biobank case-control analysis (30,802 self-reported cases, 78,586 controls, p = 0.015); and rs58389158 (odds ratio = 1.132, p = 1.8x10-9), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00021). The latter SNP lies just outside exon 8 and is highly correlated (r2 = 0.96) with the missense SNP rs5756795 in exon 7 of TRIOBP, a gene previously associated with prelingual nonsyndromic hearing loss. We further tested these SNPs in phenotypes from audiologist notes available on a subset of GERA (4,903 individuals), stratified by case/control status, to construct an independent replication test, and found a significant effect of rs58389158 on speech reception threshold (SRT; overall GERA meta-analysis p = 1.9x10-6). We also tested variants within exons of 132 other previously-identified hearing loss genes, and identified two common additional significant SNPs: rs2877561 (synonymous change in ILDR1, p = 6.2x10-5), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00057), and had a significant GERA SRT (p = 0.00019) and speech discrimination score (SDS; p = 0.0019); and rs9493627 (missense change in EYA4, p = 0.00011) which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.0095), other GERA groups (p = 0.0080), and had a consistent significant result for SRT (p = 0.041) and suggestive result for SDS (p = 0.081). Large cohorts with GWAS data and electronic health records may be a useful method to characterize the genetic architecture of ARHI."	"To evaluate the contribution of eight small NSHL-AR (non-syndromic deafness, autosomal recessive) genes to hereditary hearing loss in Czech patients.Unrelated Czech patients, adults and children, diagnosed with pre-lingual hereditary hearing loss with at least one similarly affected deaf sibling and with previously excluded mutations in the GJB2 gene were investigated by Sanger sequencing of the selected eight small NSHL-AR associated genes (CABP2 - 51 patients, CIB2 - 45 patients, PJVK/DFNB59 - 53 patients, GJB3 - 46 patients, ILDR1 - 48 patients, LHFPL5 - 66 patients, LRTOMT - 60 patients, TMIE - 64 patients).Mutations were detected in the LHFPL5 (DFNB67) gene. The patient is heterozygote for two already described pathogenic variants (p.Tyr127Cys, p.Thr165Met). In five samples, five rare heterozygous variants (two novel) predicted as pathogenic were detected in genes CABP2, ILDR1, LHFPL5 and LRTOMT.Mutations in eight small NSHL-AR genes are not a frequent cause of hereditary hearing loss in the Czech Republic. This diagnostic approach permitted the clarification of HL in only one patient - two heterozygous mutations were detected in LHFPL5 gene for the first time in Central Europe. As the use of panel base MPS certainly improves the diagnostic yield, future studies should rather profit from that diagnostic strategy."	"Tight junctions (TJs) are structures that seal the space between the epithelial cell sheets. In the inner ear, the barrier function of TJs is indispensable for the separation of the endolymphatic and perilymphatic spaces, which is essential for the generation and maintenance of the endocochlear potential (EP). TJs are formed by the intercellular binding of membrane proteins, known as claudins, and mutations in these proteins cause deafness in humans and mice. Within the epithelial cell sheet, however, a bound structure is present at the site where the corners of three cells meet (tricellular tight junctions (tTJs)), and the maintenance of the barrier function at this location cannot be explained by the claudins alone. Tricellulin and the angulin family of proteins (angulin-1/LSR, angulin-2/ILDR1, and angulin-3/ILDR2) have been identified as tTJ-associated proteins. Tricellulin and ILDR1 are localized at the tTJ and alterations in these proteins have been reported to be involved in deafness. In this review, we will present the current state of knowledge for tTJs. "	"Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness (ARNSD) is characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, with reported mutations in 58 different genes. This study was designed to detect deafness-causing variants in a multiethnic cohort with ARNSD by using whole-exome sequencing (WES).After excluding mutations in the most common gene, GJB2, we performed WES in 160 multiplex families with ARNSD from Turkey, Iran, Mexico, Ecuador, and Puerto Rico to screen for mutations in all known ARNSD genes.We detected ARNSD-causing variants in 90 (56%) families, 54% of which had not been previously reported. Identified mutations were located in 31 known ARNSD genes. The most common genes with mutations were MYO15A (13%), MYO7A (11%), SLC26A4 (10%), TMPRSS3 (9%), TMC1 (8%), ILDR1 (6%), and CDH23 (4%). Nine mutations were detected in multiple families with shared haplotypes, suggesting founder effects.We report on a large multiethnic cohort with ARNSD in which comprehensive analysis of all known ARNSD genes identifies causative DNA variants in 56% of the families. In the remaining families, WES allows us to search for causative variants in novel genes, thus improving our ability to explain the underlying etiology in more families.Genet Med 18 4, 364-371."	"Tricellular tight junctions seal the extracellular spaces of tricellular contacts, where the vertices of three epithelial cells meet, and are required for the establishment of a strong barrier function of the epithelial cellular sheet. Angulins and tricellulin are known as specific protein components of tricellular tight junctions, where angulins recruit tricellulin. Mutations in the genes encoding angulin-2/ILDR1 and tricellulin have been reported to cause human hereditary deafness DFNB42 and DFNB49, respectively. To investigate the pathogenesis of DFNB42, we analyzed mice with a targeted disruption of Ildr1, which encodes angulin-2/ILDR1. Ildr1 null mice exhibited profound deafness. Hair cells in the cochlea of Ildr1 null mice develop normally, but begin to degenerate by two weeks after birth. Tricellulin localization at tricellular contacts of the organ of Corti in the cochlea was retained in Ildr1 null mice, but its distribution along the depth of tricellular contacts was affected. Interestingly, compensatory tricellular contact localization of angulin-1/LSR was observed in the organ of Corti in Ildr1 null mice although it was hardly detected in the organ of Corti in wild-type mice. The onset of hair cell degeneration in Ildr1 null mice was earlier than that in the reported Tric mutant mice, which mimic one of the tricellulin mutations in DFNB49 deafness. These results indicate that the angulin-2/ILDR1 deficiency causes the postnatal degenerative loss of hair cells in the cochlea, leading to human deafness DFNB42. Our data also suggest that angulin family proteins have distinct functions in addition to their common roles of tricellulin recruitment and that the function of angulin-2/ILDR1 for hearing cannot be substituted by angulin-1/LSR.

"LHFPL5"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two <i>lhfpl5</i> genes (<i>lhfpl5a</i> and <i>lhfpl5b</i>), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed. Here we show that the zebrafish <i>lhfpl5</i> genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: <i>lhfpl5a</i> expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while <i>lhfpl5b</i> expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, <i>lhfpl5a</i> mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of <i>lhfpl5b</i> affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both <i>lhfpl5a</i> and <i>lhfpl5b</i> mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins."	"Hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder affecting approximately 360 million people worldwide and is among the most common sensorineural disorders. Here, we report a genetic analysis of seven large consanguineous families segregating prelingual sensorineural hearing loss. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed seven different pathogenic variants segregating with hearing loss in these families, three novel variants (c.1204G&gt;A, c.322G&gt;T, and c.5587C&gt;T) in <i>TMPRSS3, ESRRB,</i> and <i>OTOF</i>, and four previously reported variants (c.208C&gt;T, c.6371G&gt;A, c.226G&gt;A, and c.494C&gt;T) in <i>LRTOMT</i>, <i>MYO15A</i>, <i>KCNE1</i>, and <i>LHFPL5</i>, respectively<i>.</i> All identified variants had very low frequencies in the control databases and were predicted to have pathogenic effects on the encoded proteins. In addition to being familial, we also found intersibship locus heterogeneity in the evaluated families. The known pathogenic c.226C&gt;T variant identified in <i>KCNE1</i> only segregates with the hearing loss phenotype in a subset of affected members of the family GCNF21. This study further highlights the challenges of identifying disease-causing variants for highly heterogeneous disorders and reports the identification of three novel and four previously reported variants in seven known deafness genes."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"A large number of studies have focused on the generation of dopaminergic neurons from pluripotent cells. Differentiation of stem cells into distinct cell types is influenced by tissue-specific microenvironment. Since, central nervous system undergoes further development during postnatal life, in the present study neonatal rat brain tissue extract (NRBE) was applied to direct the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma stem cell line, P19 into dopaminergic (DA) phenotypes. Additionally, a neuroprotective drug, deprenyl was used alone or in combination with the extract. Results from morphological, immunofluorescence, and qPCR analyses showed that during a period of one to three weeks, a large percentage of stem cells were differentiated into neural cells. The results also indicated the greater effect of NRBE on the differentiation of the cells into tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing cells. MS analysis of NRBE showed the enrichment of gene ontology terms related to cell differentiation and neurogenesis. Network analysis of the studied genes and some DA markers resulted in the suggestion of potential regulatory candidates such as AVP, ACHE, LHFPL5, and DLK1 genes. In conclusion, NRBE as a natural native inducer was apparently able to simulate the brain microenvironment and support neural differentiation of P19 cells."	"Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory deficit in humans, and genetic factors contribute to about half of the cases. With 112 causative genes identified so far and a disproportionate share of the genes within different ethnic groups, HL has proven to be quite heterogeneous.Twenty Iranian families having at least 2 children with hereditary HL were initially verified to be GJB2-negative and were then subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing was used to confirm segregation of the variant identified in each family.In 3 families, WES revealed 3 novel variants in KCNQ4, LHFPL5 and COCH genes. The KCNQ4 gene (DFNA2A) encodes a potassium channel (KV7.4) and the heterozygous variant identified (c.1647C&gt;G, p.F549L) resulted in the substitution of Phe549 residing in the KV7.4 cytoplasmic region. The homozygous variant (c.34A&gt;T, p.K12X) was identified in the LHFPL5 gene (DFNB67) which encodes a transmembrane protein, and another variant in a homozygous state (c.116T&gt;A, p.L39X) was identified in the COCH gene which encodes a secretory protein. Pathogenic variants in the COCH gene are associated with late onset autosomal dominant hearing loss (DFNA9) but the affected individuals displayed early onset HL with a recessive mode of inheritance.The 16% contribution of GJB2 to HL in the Iranian population necessitates the discovery of the remaining causal factors. This study is the first to report KCNQ4 and COCH related HL in the Iranian population and the second study, globally, to report HL due to biallelic inactivation of the COCH gene."	"The channel that governs mechanotransduction (MT) by hair cells in the inner ear has been investigated intensively for 4 decades, but its precise molecular composition remains enigmatic. Transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1) was recently identified as a component of the MT channel, and lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) is considered to be part of the MT complex and may functionally couple the tip link to the MT channel. As components of the MT complex, TMC1 and LHFPL5 are expected to localize at the lower end of the tip link in hair cells, a notion generally supported by previous studies on neonatal mice. However, the localization of these 2 proteins, particularly in the hair cells of adult mice, remains incompletely elucidated. Because determination of TMC1 and LHFPL5 localization at distinct developmental stages is essential for understanding their function and regulation, we used several approaches to examine the localization of these proteins in neonatal and adult hair cells in the mouse. We report several notable findings: <i>1</i>) TMC1 and LHFPL5 predominantly localize at the tip of the shorter rows of stereocilia in neonatal hair cells, which largely verifies the previously published findings in neonatal hair cells; <i>2</i>) LHFPL5 persists in the hair bundle of hair cells after postnatal day (P)7, which clarifies the previously reported unexpected absence of LHFPL5 after P7 and supports the view that LHFPL5 is a permanent component in the MT complex; and <i>3</i>) TMC1 and LHFPL5 remain at the tip of the shorter rows of stereocilia in adult outer hair cells, but in adult inner hair cells, TMC1 is uniformly distributed in both the tallest row and the shorter rows of stereocilia, whereas LHFPL5 is uniformly distributed in the shorter rows of stereocilia. These findings raise intriguing questions regarding the turnover rate, regulation, additional functions, and functional interaction of TMC1 and LHFPL5. Our study confirms the previous findings in neonatal hair cells and reveals several previously unidentified aspects of TMC1 and LHFPL5 localization in more mature hair cells.-Li, X., Yu, X., Chen, X., Liu, Z., Wang, G., Li, C., Wong, E. Y. M., Sham, M. H., Tang, J., He, J., Xiong, W., Liu, Z., Huang, P. Localization of TMC1 and LHFPL5 in auditory hair cells in neonatal and adult mice."	"Transmembrane channel like protein 1 (TMC1) is likely to be a pore-forming subunit of the transduction channel of cochlear hair cells that is mechanically gated by tension on tip links in the stereocilia bundle. To localise TMC1 precisely, we labelled mice cochleae of different ages using custom-made polyclonal antibodies to TMC1 for light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Immunofluorescence revealed stereocilia labelling at P9 but not at P3 in apical hair cells. Immunogold labelling for TEM confirmed that labelling was absent at P3, and showed weak labelling at P6 with no stereocilia tip labelling, increasing at P9, with specific tip labelling on shorter stereocilia and some throughout the bundle. At P12 and P21, labelling was refined mostly to stereocilia tips. Quantification showed that labelling overall reached maximum by P12, labelling per tip was relatively constant from P9 to P21, but percent tips labelled was reduced from 16% to 8%. Tmc1<sup>-/-</sup> showed no labelling. Thus TMC1 occurs at the lower end of the tip link, supporting its presence in the MET complex and likely the channel. Tip localisation from P9 onwards coincides with lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5), a protein that may be involved in acquiring/maintaining TMC1 localisation."	"Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) responding to acceleration stimuli is originated from the vestibular apparatuses and thus widely used as an in vivo indicator of the vestibular function. We have developed a vestibular function testing (VFT) system that allows to evaluate VOR response with improved efficiency. The previously required surgical procedure has been avoided by using a newly designed animal-immobility setup. The efficacy of our VFT system was demonstrated on the mice with vestibular abnormalities caused by either genetic mutations (Lhfpl5<sup>-/-</sup> or Cdh23<sup>-/-</sup>) or applied vestibulotoxicant (3,3'-iminodipropionitrile, IDPN). Daily longitudinal inspection of the VOR response in the IDPN-administered mice gives the first VOR-based daily-progression profile of the vestibular impairment. The capability of VOR in quantifying the severity of toxicant-induced vestibular deficits has been also demonstrated. The acquired VOR-measurement results were validated against the corresponding behavioral-test results. Further validation against immunofluorescence microscopy was applied to the VOR data obtained from the IDPN-administered mice. We conclude that the improved efficiency of our surgery-free VFT system, firstly, enables the characterization of VOR temporal dynamics and quantification of vestibular-impairment severity that may reveal useful information in toxicological and/or pharmaceutical studies; and, secondly, confers our system promising potential to serve as a high-throughput screener for identifying genes and drugs that affect vestibular function."	"Hearing loss is a debilitating disorder that impairs language acquisition, resulting in disability in children and potential isolation in adulthood. Its onset can have a genetic basis, though environmental factors, which are often preventable, can also cause the condition. The genetic forms are highly heterogeneous, and early detection is necessary to arrange appropriate patient support. Here we report the molecular basis of hereditary hearing loss in a consanguineous family with multiple affected members from Oman. Combining homozygosity mapping with whole exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous nucleotide substitution c.575T &gt; C in the lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 gene (LHFPL5), that converted the 192<sup>nd</sup> amino acid residue in the protein from a leucine to a proline, p.(Leu192Pro). Sanger sequencing confirmed segregation with the disease phenotype as expected for a recessive condition and the variant was absent in 123,490 subjects from various disease-specific and population genetic studies as well as 150 unrelated individuals and 35 deaf patients of Omani ethnicity. This study, which describes a novel LHFPL5 mutation in a family of Omani origin with hereditary hearing loss, supports previous clinical descriptions of the condition and contributes to the genetic spectrum of mutations in this form of deafness."	"Reunion Island is a French oversea department in the Indian Ocean with 1.6/1000, an estimated prevalence of deafness that is almost double as compared to the mainland France. Twelve children having isolated bilateral prelingual profound deafness along with motor delay attributed to vestibular areflexia were enrolled. Their mean walking age was 19 months. Electroretinography and temporal bone CT-scans were normal in all cases. A novel homozygous frameshift lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) variant c.185delT p.(Phe62Serfs*23) was identified using whole-exome sequencing. It was found in seven families. Four patients from two different families from both Reunion Island and mainland France, were compound heterozygous: c.185delT p.(Phe62Serfs*23) and c.472C &gt; T p.(Arg158Trp). The phenotype observed in our patients completely mimics the hurry-scurry (hscy) murine Tmhs knock-out model. The recurrent occurrence of same LHFPL5 variant in Reunion Island is attributed to common ancestor couple born in 1693."	"The TMC1 channel was identified as a protein essential for hearing in mouse and human, and recognized as one of a family of eight such proteins in mammals. The TMC family is part of a superfamily of seven branches, which includes the TMEM16s. Vertebrate hair cells express both TMC1 and TMC2. They are located at the tips of stereocilia and are required for hair cell mechanotransduction. TMC1 assembles as a dimer and its similarity to the TMEM16s has enabled a predicted tertiary structure with an ion conduction pore in each subunit of the dimer. Cysteine mutagenesis of the pore supports the role of TMC1 and TMC2 as the core channel proteins of a larger mechanotransduction complex that includes PCDH15 and LHFPL5, and perhaps TMIE, CIB2 and others."	"LHFPL5, the gene for DFNB67, underlies autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment. We identified seven Pakistani families that mapped to 6p21.31, which includes the LHFPL5 gene. Sanger sequencing of LHFPL5 using DNA samples from hearing impaired and unaffected members of these seven families identified four variants. Among the identified variants, two were novel: one missense c.452 G &gt; T (p.Gly151Val) and one splice site variant (c.*16 + 1 G &gt; A) were each identified in two families. Two known variants: c.250delC (p.Leu84*) and c.380 A &gt; G (p.Tyr127Cys) were also observed in two families and a single family, respectively. Nucleotides c.452G and c.*16 + 1G and amino-acid residue p.Gly151 are under strong evolutionary conservation. In silico bioinformatics analyses predicted these variants to be damaging. The splice site variant (c.*16 + 1 G &gt; A) is predicted to affect pre-mRNA splicing and a loss of the 5' donor splice site in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Further analysis supports the activation of a cryptic splice site approximately 357-bp downstream, leading to an extended 3'-UTR with additional regulatory motifs. In conclusion, we identified two novel variants in LHFPL5, including a unique 3'-UTR splice site variant that is predicted to impact pre-mRNA splicing and regulation through an extended 3'-UTR."	"Hearing and balance involve the transduction of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals by deflection of bundles of stereocilia linked together by protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 'tip links'. PCDH15 transduces tip link tension into opening of a mechano-electrical transduction (MET) ion channel. PCDH15 also interacts with LHFPL5, a candidate subunit of the MET channel. Here we illuminate the PCDH15-LHFPL5 structure, showing how the complex is composed of PCDH15 and LHFPL5 subunit pairs related by a 2-fold axis. The extracellular cadherin domains define a mobile tether coupled to a rigid, 2-fold symmetric 'collar' proximal to the membrane bilayer. LHFPL5 forms extensive interactions with the PCDH15 transmembrane helices and stabilizes the overall PCDH15-LHFPL5 assembly. Our studies illuminate the architecture of the PCDH15-LHFPL5 complex, localize mutations associated with deafness, and shed new light on how forces in the PCDH15 tether may be transduced into the stereocilia membrane."	"Hair cells in the inner ear convert mechanical stimuli provided by sound waves and head movements into electrical signal. Several mechanically evoked ionic currents with different properties have been recorded in hair cells. The search for the proteins that form the underlying ion channels is still in progress. The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel near the tips of stereociliary in hair cells, which is responsible for sensory transduction, has been studied most extensively. Several components of the sensory mechanotransduction machinery in stereocilia have been identified, including the multi-transmembrane proteins tetraspan membrane protein in hair cell stereocilia (TMHS)/LHFPL5, transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) and transmembrane channel-like proteins 1 and 2 (TMC1/2). However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the molecules that form the channel pore. In addition to the sensory MET channel, hair cells express the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2, which is localized near the base of stereocilia and not essential for sensory transduction. The function of PIEZO2 in hair cells is not entirely clear but it might have a role in damage sensing and repair processes. Additional stretch-activated channels of unknown molecular identity and function have been found to localize at the basolateral membrane of hair cells. Here, we review current knowledge regarding the different mechanically gated ion channels in hair cells and discuss open questions concerning their molecular composition and function."	"Hearing loss (HL) is a common sensory disorder in humans with high genetic heterogeneity. To date, over 145 loci have been identified to cause nonsyndromic deafness. Furthermore, there are countless families unsuitable for the conventional linkage analysis. In the present study, we used a custom capture panel (MiamiOtoGenes) to target sequence 180 deafness-associated genes in 5 <i>GJB2</i> negative deaf probands with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic HL from Iran. In these 5 families, we detected one reported and six novel mutations in 5 different deafness autosomal recessive (DFNB) genes <i>(TRIOBP, LHFPL5, CDH23, PCDH15,</i> and <i>MYO7A)</i>. The custom capture panel in our study provided an efficient and comprehensive diagnosis for known deafness genes in small families."	"Mechanosensory transduction by vertebrate hair cells depends on a protein complex at the tips of shorter stereocilia associated with mechanoelectrical transduction channels activated by tip links in the hair bundle. In mammalian hair cells, this complex includes transmembrane channel-like protein subunit 1 (TMC1), lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 protein (LHFPL5) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), a lower-end component of the tip link. TMC1 interacts with LHFPL5 and PCDH15 but how the complex develops to maturity, and the relationships between these proteins, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the spatiotemporal development of LHFPL5 distributions in mouse cochlear hair bundles by immunofluorescence and immunogold transmission electron microscopy, from postnatal day 0 (P0) through P21 in wild type and PCDH15-deficient mice. At P0, hair bundles contain many short microvilli-like processes which we term unranked stereocilia, and a subset of lengthening rows, adjacent to a kinocilium. LHFPL5 is distributed throughout the bundle, including on stereocilia tips and the kinocilium. At P3, 4-to-6 rows of ranked stereocilia are evident, total LHFPL5 expression peaks, and LHFPL5 is localised to ranked stereocilia tips of all rows and to lower shaft/ankle links. By P12, the bundle has a mature pattern with 3 ranked rows but virtually no unranked stereocilia or kinocilium; LHFPL5 expression has declined and become restricted to the tips of shorter stereocilia. Throughout development from P0, expression of LHFPL5 is greater overall on apical than basal bundles, but there is, on average, an equal amount of labelling per labelled tip. In P3 mice lacking PCDH15, LHFPL5 labelling is not at the tips but is primarily on unranked stereocilia and lower lateral links. These data show that LHFPL5 is already present in the MET apparatus at P0 but requires PCDH15 at P3 to remain there. Shaft/ankle link localisation suggests it interacts with link proteins other than PCDH15."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"To investigate the causative genetic mutations in 12 Pakistani families with nonsyndromic or syndromic hearing loss.Mutations in the most common causative gene for hearing loss, GJB2, were evaluated by Sanger sequencing. Targeted next-generation sequencing or whole-exome sequencing was used to analyze the genomic DNA samples from 11 probands with hearing loss. Sanger sequencing was performed to verify all identified variants.We found pathogenic, or likely to be pathogenic, mutations in all 12 families, including six known mutations in GJB2, SLC26A4, LHFPL5, and USH2A and eight novel mutations in ESPN, MYO7A, LRTOMT, PCDH15, USH2A, or EPS8L2. Notably, four compound heterozygous mutations in the MYO7A and USH2A genes were detected in two consanguineous families. In addition, the novel frameshift mutation in EPS8L2 was first documented in Pakistan.Our study increases the spectrum of mutations associated with hearing loss in the Pakistani population. In addition, our study highlights the fact that compound heterozygous mutations, although rare, can occur in consanguineous families."	"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a safe and effective vector for gene therapy for retinal disorders. Gene therapy for hearing disorders is not as advanced, in part because gene delivery to sensory hair cells of the inner ear is inefficient. Although AAV transduces the inner hair cells of the mouse cochlea, outer hair cells remain refractory to transduction. Here, we demonstrate that a vector, exosome-associated AAV (exo-AAV), is a potent carrier of transgenes to all inner ear hair cells. Exo-AAV1-GFP is more efficient than conventional AAV1-GFP, both in mouse cochlear explants in vitro and with direct cochlear injection in vivo. Exo-AAV shows no toxicity in vivo, as assayed by tests of auditory and vestibular function. Finally, exo-AAV1 gene therapy partially rescues hearing in a mouse model of hereditary deafness (lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5/tetraspan membrane protein of hair cell stereocilia [Lhfpl5/Tmhs<sup>-/-</sup>]). Exo-AAV is a powerful gene delivery system for hair cell research and may be useful for gene therapy for deafness."	"Hair cells in the mammalian cochlea are specialized mechanosensory cells that convert sound-induced vibrations into electrochemical signals. The molecular composition of the mechanotransduction channel underlying auditory perception has been difficult to define. The study of genes that are linked to inherited forms of deafness has recently provided tantalizing clues. Current findings indicate that the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells is a complex molecular machine. Four different proteins (TMHS/LHFPL5, TMIE, TMC1, and TMC2) have so far been linked to the transduction channel, but which proteins contribute to the channel pore still needs to be determined. Current evidence also suggests that the channel complex may contain additional, yet to be identified components."
"LOXHD1"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders in newborns and is mostly caused by genetic factors. Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is usually characterized as a severe-to-profound congenital sensorineural hearing loss and later can cause various degrees of defect in the language and intelligent development of newborns. The mutations in <i>LOXHD1</i> gene have been shown to cause DFNB77, a type of ARNSHL. To date, there are limited reports about the association between <i>LOXHD1</i> gene and ARNSHL. In this study, we reported six patients from four Chinese families suffering from severe-to-profound nonsyndromic hearing loss. We performed targeted next generation sequencing in the six affected members and identified five novel pathogenic mutations in <i>LOXHD1</i> including c.277G&gt;A (p.D93N), c.611-2A&gt;T, c.1255+3A&gt;G, c.2329C&gt;T (p.Q777 <sup>                        <i>∗</i>                    </sup> ), and c.5888delG (p.G1963Afs <sup>                        <i>∗</i>                    </sup> 136). These mutations were confirmed to be cosegregated with the hearing impairment in the families by Sanger sequencing and were inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. All of the five mutations were absent in 200 control subjects. There were no symptoms of Fuchs corneal dystrophy in the probands and their blood-related relatives. We concluded that these five novel mutations could be involved in the underlying mechanism resulting in the hearing loss, and this discovery expands the genotypic spectrum of <i>LOXHD1</i> mutations."	"Variants of the <i>LOXHD1</i> gene, which are expressed in hair cells of the cochlea and vestibule, have been reported to cause a progressive form of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hereditary hearing loss, DFNB77. In this study, genetic screening was conducted on 8074 Japanese hearing loss patients utilizing massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify individuals with <i>LOXHD1</i> variants and to assess their phenotypes. A total of 28 affected individuals and 21 <i>LOXHD1</i> variants were identified, among which 13 were novel variants. A recurrent variant c.4212 + 1G &gt; A, only reported in Japanese patients, was detected in 18 individuals. Haplotype analysis implied that this variation occurred in a mutational hot spot, and that multiple ancestors of Japanese population had this variation. Patients with <i>LOXHD1</i> variations mostly showed early onset hearing loss and presented different progression rates. We speculated that the varying severities and progression rates of hearing loss are the result of environmental and/or other genetic factors. No accompanying symptoms, including vestibular dysfunction, with hearing loss were detected in this study. Few studies have reported the clinical features of <i>LOXHD1</i>-gene associated hearing loss, and this study is by far the largest study focused on the evaluation of this gene."	"To investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene in a large cohort of German patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD).Genomic DNA was obtained from 398 patients with FECD and from 58 non-FECD controls. Thirty-seven previously reported SNPs were evaluated by genotyping. The 398 FECD samples were analyzed for TNR expansions by short tandem repeat assays and Southern blotting. The possible associations between the TNR length and clinical parameters (age, sex, visual acuity, and central corneal thickness) were analyzed in 132 patients.The SNPs in COL8A2, TCF8, LOXHD1, and AGBL1 showed no heterogeneity in 36 cases, although SLCA411 showed 3 nonsense mutations. SNPs were detected for TCF4 (rs613872, rs2123392, rs17089887, rs1452787, and rs1348047), but only rs613872 showed a significant association with FECD (P = 9.93 × 10). Overall, 315/398 (79%) patients harbored TNR lengths &gt;50, whereas no non-FECD controls harbored TNR lengths &gt;50. The TCF4 SNP rs613872 genotype was TT: 39 (67%), TG: 18 (31%), and GG: 1 (2%) in non-FECD controls; TT: 39 (47%), TG: 38 (46%), and GG: 6 (7%) in FECD cases harboring TNR &lt;50; and TT: 23 (8%), TG: 224 (79%), and GG: 38 (13%) in FECD cases harboring TNR &gt;50 (P = 2.93 × 10). No significant association was detected between the TNR length and clinical parameters.Our large German cohort demonstrated a significant association between the risk allele G in rs613872 and FECD, irrespective of TNR expansion, although this risk allele was more frequent in FECD cases with TNR expansion than without."	"Deafness, autosomal recessive 77 (DFNB77) is a rare non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) worldwide, which is caused by deleterious variants within lipoxygenase homology domains 1 (LOXHD1). Here we identified that a novel missense variant of LOXHD1 was associated with NSHL in a Chinese family under consanguineous marriage.A 28-year-old woman suffered a bilateral profound NSHL. Impedance audiometry, temporal bone computerized tomography (TBCT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging-inner ear hydrography (MRI-IEH) did not find any obvious abnormality of middle or inner ear. Routine genetic detection did not find pathogenic variants in common HL-associated genes. Therefore, we performed a whole-exome sequencing (WES) in this family. By trio-WES, co-segregation validation and bioinformatics analysis, we revealed that a novel homozygous variant in this patient, LOXHD1: c.5948C &gt; T (p.S1983F), might be the pathogenic factor. Her parents (heterozygotes) and brother (wild-type) were asymptomatic.We successfully identified a novel variant of LOXHD1 associated with a rare NSHL from a Chinese family. Our finds highlight the effectiveness of trio-WES for molecular diagnosis of rare NHSL, and expand the genotypic spectrum of DFNB77."	"Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is a common disorder characterized by a huge genetic heterogeneity. The definition of a correct molecular diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling, recurrence risk estimation, and therapeutic options. From 20 to 40% of patients carry mutations in <i>GJB2</i> gene, thus, in more than half of cases it is necessary to look for causative variants in the other genes so far identified (~100). In this light, the use of next-generation sequencing technologies has proved to be the best solution for mutational screening, even though it is not always conclusive. Here we describe a combined approach, based on targeted re-sequencing (TRS) of 96 HHL genes followed by high-density SNP arrays, aimed at the identification of the molecular causes of non-syndromic HHL (NSHL). This strategy has been applied to study 103 Italian unrelated cases, negative for mutations in <i>GJB2</i>, and led to the characterization of 31% of them (i.e., 37% of familial and 26.3% of sporadic cases). In particular, TRS revealed <i>TECTA</i> and <i>ACTG1</i> genes as major players in the Italian population. Furthermore, two <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>ACTG</i>1 have been identified and investigated through protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, confirming their likely pathogenic effect. Among the selected patients analyzed by SNP arrays (negative to TRS, or with a single variant in a recessive gene) a molecular diagnosis was reached in ~36% of cases, highlighting the importance to look for large insertions/deletions. Moreover, copy number variants analysis led to the identification of the first case of uniparental disomy involving <i>LOXHD1</i> gene. Overall, taking into account the contribution of <i>GJB2</i>, plus the results from TRS and SNP arrays, it was possible to reach a molecular diagnosis in ~51% of NSHL cases. These data proved the usefulness of a combined approach for the analysis of NSHL and for the definition of the epidemiological picture of HHL in the Italian population."	"To assess the occurrence and diagnostic performance of nine single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the TCF4, SLC4A11, LOXHD1, and AGBL1 genes and the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion in a Russian cohort of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) patients.This retrospective case-control study included 100 patients diagnosed with FECD (cases) and 100 patients with cataracts (controls). Blood DNA was used to perform PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing of rs613872 and rs17595731 in TCF4, c.99-100delTC, rs267607065, rs267607064, and rs267607066 in SLC4A11, rs113444922 in LOXHD1, and rs181958589 and rs185919705 in AGBL1. The number of CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats was determined by a combination of conventional PCR or triplet primed PCR with fragment analysis.At least one rs613872 marker allele was found in 78% of FECD patients and 21% of controls, and at least one rs17595731 marker allele was found in 14% and 2%, respectively. CTG18.1 trinucleotide expansion (&gt;40 repeats) was detected in 72% of FECD patients and 5% of controls. Marker alleles of the tested SNVs in SLC4A11, LOXHD1, and rs185919705 in AGBL1 were not found in our FECD cohort. One FECD patient carried the marker allele of the rs181958589 SNV. Analysis of the diagnostic performance of individual markers in TCF4 and their combinations showed that the CTG18.1 repeat expansion was the best classifier for FECD (AUC = 0.84).Patients carrying CTG18.1 repeat expansion constituted a high proportion of the Russian FECD cohort; therefore, this marker is suitable for development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."	"For multiple generations, much of the Arab population of Northern Israel has lived in communities with consanguineous marriages and large families. These communities have been particularly cooperative and informative for understanding the genetics of recessive traits. We studied the genetics of hearing loss in this population, evaluating 168 families from 46 different villages. All families were screened for founder variants by Sanger sequencing and 13 families were further evaluated by sequencing all known genes for hearing loss using our targeted gene panel HEar-Seq. Deafness in 34 of 168 families (20%) was explained by founder variants in GJB2, SLC26A4, or OTOF. In 6 of 13 families (46%) evaluated using HEar-Seq, deafness was explained by damaging alleles of SLC26A4, MYO15A, OTOG, LOXHD1, and TBC1D24. In some genes critical to hearing, it is particularly difficult to interpret variants that might affect splicing, because the genes are not expressed in accessible tissue. To address this problem for possible splice-altering variants of MYO15A, we evaluated minigenes transfected into HEK293 cells. Results revealed exon skipping in the message of MYO15A c.9083+6T&gt;A, and intron retention in the message of MYO15A c.8340G&gt;A, in each case leading to a premature stop and consistent with co-segregation of homozygosity for each variant with hearing loss. The profile of genetics of hearing loss in this population reflects the genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss and the usefulness of synthetic technologies to evaluate potentially causal variants in genes not expressed in accessible tissues."	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss has been shown to have high genetic heterogeneity. In this report, we aimed to disclose the genetic causes of the subjects from the ten Chinese deaf families who did not have pathogenic common genes/mutation. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 142 known deafness genes was performed in the probands of ten families followed by cosegregation analysis of all family members. We identified novel pathogenic variants in six families including p.D1806E/p.R1588W, p.R964W/p.R1588W, and p.G17C/p.G1449D in <i>CDH23</i>; p.T584M/p.D1939N in <i>LOXHD1</i>; p.P1225L in <i>MYO7A</i>; and p.K612X in <i>EYA4</i>. Sanger sequencing confirmed that these mutations segregated with the hearing loss of each family. In four families, no pathogenic variants were identified. Our study provided better understanding of the mutation spectrum of hearing loss in the Chinese population."	"Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a complex degenerative disease of the corneal endothelium with genetic predisposition. Pathogenic rare variants have been identified in SLC4A11, LOXHD1, ZEB1, and AGBL1. Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CTG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the intron of TCF4 gene to FECD has been studied across multiple ethnicities. Recently, genome-wide association studies have also identified KANK4, LAMC1, and ATP1B1 as novel loci for FECD. Here, we report the contribution of ZEB1 and LOXHD1 genes in our sporadic late-onset FECD cohort.In the experimental study, coding regions of ZEB1 and LOXHD1 were screened by Sanger DNA sequencing in 52 late-onset and 5 early-onset FECD cases of Indian origin, recruited at a tertiary eye care center. Further, bioinformatics analysis was done.One reported missense mutation, c.2522A&gt;C; p.(Q841P), and one variant of uncertain significance (VUS), c.619A&gt;G; p.(S207G), were identified in the ZEB1 gene. One VUS, c.6413G&gt;Ap.(R2138Q), was observed in LOXHD1. A 3D structural bioinformatic analysis of the missense variant in LOXHD1 predicted the variant to affect the structure-function relationship of the protein.While mutations in ZEB1 contributed to 2% of the late-onset FECD cases, the exact role of the two VUS identified in ZEB1 and LOXHD1 in FECD pathogenesis needs to be studied."	"This study focuses on further characterization of the audiovestibular phenotype and on genotype-phenotype correlations of DFNB77, an autosomal recessive type of hearing impairment (HI). DFNB77 is associated with disease-causing variants in LOXHD1, and is genetically and phenotypically highly heterogeneous. Heterozygous deleterious missense variants in LOXHD1 have been associated with late-onset Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD). However, up to now screening for FCD of heterozygous carriers in DFNB77 families has not been reported. This study describes the genotype and audiovestibular phenotype of 9 families with DFNB77. In addition, carriers within the families were screened for FCD. Fifteen pathogenic missense and truncating variants were identified, of which 12 were novel. The hearing phenotype showed high inter- and intrafamilial variation in severity and progression. There was no evidence for involvement of the vestibular system. None of the carriers showed (pre-clinical) symptoms of FCD. Our findings expand the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of DFNB77, but a clear correlation between the type or location of the variant and the severity or progression of HI could not be established. We hypothesize that environmental factors or genetic modifiers are responsible for phenotypic differences. No association was found between heterozygous LOXHD1 variants and the occurrence of FCD in carriers."	"Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) develop in about 20-30% of breast cancer (BC) patients. BCBM are associated with dismal prognosis not at least due to lack of valuable molecular therapeutic targets. The aim of the study was to identify new molecular biomarkers and targets in BCBM by using complementary state-of-the-art techniques.We compared array expression profiles of three BCBM with 16 non-brain metastatic BC and 16 primary brain tumors (prBT) using a false discovery rate (FDR) p &lt; 0.05 and fold change (FC) &gt; 2. Biofunctional analysis was conducted on the differentially expressed probe sets. High-density arrays were employed to detect copy number variations (CNVs) and whole exome sequencing (WES) with paired-end reads of 150 bp was utilized to detect gene mutations in the three BCBM.The top 370 probe sets that were differentially expressed between BCBM and both BC and prBT were in the majority comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included, e.g. the coding genes BCL3, BNIP3, BNIP3P1, BRIP1, CASP14, CDC25A, DMBT1, IDH2, E2F1, MYCN, RAD51, RAD54L, and VDR. A number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included SNORA1, SNORA2A, SNORA9, SNORA10, SNORA22, SNORA24, SNORA30, SNORA37, SNORA38, SNORA52, SNORA71A, SNORA71B, SNORA71C, SNORD13P2, SNORD15A, SNORD34, SNORD35A, SNORD41, SNORD53, and SCARNA22. The top canonical pathway was entitled, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response. Network analysis revealed key nodes as Akt, ERK1/2, NFkB, and Ras in a predicted activation stage. Downregulated genes in a data set that was shared between BCBM and prBT comprised, e.g. BC cell line invasion markers JUN, MMP3, TFF1, and HAS2. Important cancer genes affected by CNVs included TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, ERBB2, IDH1, and IDH2. WES detected numerous mutations, some of which affecting BC associated genes as CDH1, HEPACAM, and LOXHD1.Using complementary molecular genetic techniques, this study identified shared and unshared molecular events in three highly aberrant BCBM emphasizing the challenge to detect new molecular biomarkers and targets with translational implications. Among new findings with the capacity to gain clinical relevance is the detection of overexpressed snoRNAs known to regulate some critical cellular functions as ribosome biogenesis."	"This study aimed to clarify the molecular epidemiology of hearing loss by identifying the responsible genes in patients without GJB2 mutations.Prospective genetic study.Tertiary referral hospital.Fifty one patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, 20 men, and 31 women, mean age 24.9 years, range 3 to 64 years, from 49 families. GJB2 and deltaGJB6-D13S1830 mutations were excluded previously.Diagnostic. Sixty-nine genes reported to be causative of hearing loss were analyzed. Sequence capture technology, next-generation sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used. Coverage of STRC was screened in Integrative Genomics Viewer software.Identification of causal pathogenic mutations in genes related to deafness.Five families (10%) had recessive STRC deletions or mutations. Five unrelated patients (10%) had recessive mutations in TMPRSS3, USH2A, PCDH15, LOXHD1, and MYO15A. Three families (6%) had autosomal dominant mutations in MYO6A, KCNQ4, and SIX1. One family (2%) had an X-linked POU3F4 mutation. Thus, we identified the cause of hearing loss in 28% of the families studied.Following GJB2, STRC was the second most frequently mutated gene in patients from the Czech Republic with hearing loss. To decrease the cost of testing, we recommend STRC deletion screening with MLPA before next-generation sequencing. The existence of a pseudogene and polymorphic STRC regions can lead to false-positive or false-negative results when copy number variation analysis is based on next-generation sequencing data."	"For recessive Mendelian disorders, determining the pathogenicity of rare, non-synonymous variants in known causative genes can be challenging without expanded pedigrees and/or functional analysis. In this study, we proposed to establish a database of rare but benign variants in recessive deafness genes by systematic carrier re-sequencing. As a pilot study, 30 heterozygous carriers of pathogenic variants for deafness were identified from unaffected family members of 18 deaf probands. The entire coding regions of the corresponding genes were re-sequenced in those carriers by targeted next-generation sequencing or Sanger sequencing. A total of 32 non-synonymous variants were identified in the normal-hearing carriers in trans with the pathogenic variant and therefore were classified as benign. Among them were five rare (minor allele frequencies less than 0.005) variants that had previously undefined, disputable or even misclassified function: p.A434T (c.1300 G &gt; A) in SLC26A4, p.R266Q (c.797 G &gt; A) in LOXHD1, p.K96Q (c.286 A &gt; C) in MYO15A, p.T123N (c.368 C &gt; A) in GJB2 and p.V1299I (c.797 G &gt; A) in CDH23. Our results suggested that large scale carrier re-sequencing may be warranted to establish a database of rare but benign variants in causative genes in order to reduce false positive genetic diagnosis of recessive Mendelian disorders."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Maternal exposure to environmental pollutants could affect fetal brain development and increase autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in conjunction with differential genetic susceptibility. Organohalogen congeners measured in maternal midpregnancy blood samples have recently shown significant, but negative associations with offspring ASD outcome. We report the first large-scale maternal and fetal genetic study of the midpregnancy serum levels of a set of 21 organohalogens in a subset of 790 genotyped women and 764 children collected in California by the Early Markers for Autism (EMA) Project. Levels of PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) and PBDE (polybrominated diphenyl ether) congeners showed high maternal and fetal estimated SNP-based heritability (<i>h</i><sup>2</sup><i>                        <sub>g</sub>                    </i> ) accounting for 39-99% of the total variance. Genome-wide association analyses identified significant maternal loci for p,p'-DDE (<i>P</i> = 7.8 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) in the <i>CYP2B6</i> gene and for BDE-28 (<i>P</i> = 3.2 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) near the <i>SH3GL2</i> gene, both involved in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism. Fetal genetic loci contributed to the levels of BDE-100 (<i>P</i> = 4.6 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and PCB187 (<i>P</i> = 2.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), near the potential metabolic genes <i>LOXHD1</i> and <i>PTPRD</i>, previously implicated in neurodevelopment. Negative associations were observed for BDE-100, BDE153, and the sum of PBDEs with ASD, partly explained by genome-wide additive genetic effects that predicted PBDE levels. Our results support genetic control of midgestational biomarkers for environmental exposures by nonoverlapping maternal and fetal genetic determinants, suggesting that future studies of environmental risk factors should take genetic variation into consideration. The independent influence of fetal genetics supports previous hypotheses that fetal genotypes expressed in placenta can influence maternal physiology and the transplacental transfer of organohalogens."	"Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is one of the most common congenital birth defects. NSCL/P is a complex multifactorial disease caused by interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. However, the causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signature profile underlying the risk of familial NSCL/P still remains unknown. We previously reported a 5.7-Mb genomic region on chromosome 18q21.1 locus that potentially contributes to autosomal dominant, low-penetrance inheritance of NSCL/P. In the current study, we performed exome sequencing on 12 familial genomes (six affected individuals, two obligate carriers, and four seemingly unaffected individuals) of a six-generation family to identify candidate SNPs associated with NSCL/P risk. Subsequently, targeted bidirectional DNA re-sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified high-risk regions of MYO5B gene and sequenom iPLEX genotpying of 29 candidate SNPs were performed on a larger set of 33 members of this NSCL/P family (10 affected + 4 obligate carriers + 19 unaffected relatives) to find SNPs significantly associated with NSCL/P trait. SNP vs. NSCL/P association analysis showed the MYO5B SNP rs183559995 GA genotype had an odds ratio of 18.09 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.86-176.34; gender-adjusted P = 0.0019) compared to the reference GG genotype. Additionally, the following SNPs were also found significantly associated with NSCL/P risk: rs1450425 (LOXHD1), rs6507992 (SKA1), rs78950893 (SMAD7), rs8097060, rs17713847 (SCARNA17), rs6507872 (CTIF), rs8091995 (CTIF), and rs17715416 (MYO5B). We could thus identify mutations in several genes as key candidate SNPs associated with the risk of NSCL/P in this large multi-generation family. "	"The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic basis of a multi-generational family with late-onset (LO) Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD). Five FCD causal genes [solute carrier family 4, sodium borate transporter, member 11 (SLC4A11), zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), lipoxygenase homology domains 1 (LOXHD1), collagen, type VIII, alpha 2 (COL8A2) and transcription factor 4 (TCF4)], previously reported to be implicated in the pathogenesis of FCD, were screened. A total of 27 variants [including 22 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) and 5 variants absent from dbSNP] were detected in this FCD pedigree across the SLC4A11, ZEB1, LOXHD1 and COL8A2 genes as follows: i) 22 known SNPs from dbSNP, including 3 coding (p.R161R, p.S213S and p.T833T) and 11 non-coding variants of SLC4A11, 2 intronic SNPs of ZEB1 from dbSNP (rs220057 and rs220060), 1 intronic SNP of LOXHD1 from dbSNP (rs16939650), and 5 SNPs of COL8A2 from dbSNP (p.A35A, p.R155Q, p.L335L, p.G495G and p.T502M); and ii) 5 variants that have not been previously reported in FCD patients and that are absent from dbSNP were identified across the ZEB1 and LOXHD1 genes; these included 3 continuous indels located at the junction of the 5'-UTR and the adjacent exon 1 of ZEB1 [Indel 1 (c.-86_-53delins gggaggggtggaggcggaggggtGGGGGGGAAGG); Indel 2 (c.-52_-46delinsGGGAGGG); and Indel 3 (c.-45_-42delinsAGGG)], and 2 intronic variants of LOXHD1 (c.5332-126C&gt;T and c.1809+155G&gt;A). Apart from one intronic SNP of SLC4A11 from dbSNP (rs372201212), the pathologic consequence of which is uncertain, and 2 intron variants of LOXHD1 (c.5332-126C&gt;T and c.1809+155G&gt;A); the variants likely represent examples of de novo mutations. Neither of the other 24 variants provided strong evidence of pathogenesis in this FCD pedigree. An analysis of 7 SNPs in TCF4 from dbSNP, which have been associated with LO FCD in different populations, revealed that these 7 SNPs were not associated with FCD in this specific pedigree. A genome‑wide linkage scan to search for linkage to one of the previously described FCD loci or to identify a novel locus for FCD will need to be performed in this FCD pedigree. Our observation, nevertheless, expands the knowledge of the genetic status of patients with FCD. "	"To report two novel LOXHD1 mutations, including missense mutations and the clinical features of the patients.We studied a three-generation Japanese family with hearing loss. Targeted next-generation sequencing was used for genetic analysis. Conditional orientation response audiometry and pure tone audiometry were used to assess hearing. SWISS-MODEL was used for molecular modeling of the PLAT domain in LOXHD1 protein.The two sisters, who had either mild or severe high-frequency hearing loss, were compound heterozygous for two novel mutations (c.5674G&gt;T [p.V1892F] and c.4212+1G&gt;A) in LOXHD1, which is responsible for autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNB77. These cases showed less severe hearing impairment than the previously reported cases carrying LOXHD1 mutations, but their hearing loss appeared to be progressive. Molecular modeling predicted that distorted structure of the PLAT domain in the p.V1892F mutant could lead to decreased affinity of the protein to lipid membrane resulting in hair cell dysfunction.We report a Japanese family carrying compound heterozygotes of truncating and nontruncating mutations in LOXHD1 identified by targeted NGS analysis. The fact of lower degree of hearing impairment in our cases than previously reported and the molecular modeling of the missense mutant provide insight to the genotype-phenotype correlation of DFNB77."	"Comprehensive genetic testing has the potential to become the standard of care for individuals with hearing loss. In this study, we investigated the genetic etiology of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in a Turkish cohort including individuals with cochlear implant, who had a pedigree suggestive of an autosomal recessive inheritance. A workflow including prescreening of GJB2 and a targeted next generation sequencing panel (Illumına TruSightTM Exome) covering 2761 genes that we briefly called as mendelian exome sequencing was used. This panel includes 102 deafness genes and a number of genes causing Mendelian disorders. Using this approach, we identified causative variants in 21 of 29 families. Three different GJB2 variants were present in seven families. Remaining 14 families had 15 different variants in other known NSHL genes (MYO7A, MYO15A, MARVELD2, TMIE, DFNB31, LOXHD1, GPSM2, TMC1, USH1G, CDH23). Of these variants, eight are novel. Mutation detection rate of our workflow is 72.4%, confirming the usefulness of targeted sequencing approach in NSHL."	NA
"MARVELD2"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Tight junctions (TJs) are cellular junctions within the mammalian epithelial cell sheet that function as a physical barrier to molecular transport within the intercellular space. Dysregulation of TJs leads to various diseases. Tricellular TJs (tTJs), specialized structural variants of TJs, are formed by multiple transmembrane proteins (e.g., lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor [LSR] and tricellulin) within tricellular contacts in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet. However, the mechanism for recruiting LSR and tricellulin to tTJs is largely unknown. Previous studies have identified that tyrphostin 9, the dual inhibitor of Pyk2 (a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase) and receptor tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), suppresses LSR and tricellulin recruitment to tTJs in EpH4 (a mouse mammary epithelial cell line) cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of Pyk2 inhibition on LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs. Pyk2 inactivation by its specific inhibitor or repression by RNAi inhibited the localization of LSR and downstream tricellulin to tTJs without changing their expression level in EpH4 cells. Pyk2-dependent changes in subcellular LSR and tricellulin localization were independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and expression. Additionally, Pyk2-dependent LSR phosphorylation at Tyr-237 was required for LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs and decreased epithelial barrier function. Our findings indicated a novel mechanism by which Pyk2 regulates tTJ assembly and epithelial barrier function in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet."	"Meniere's disease (MD) is a clinical spectrum of rare disorders characterized by vertigo attacks, associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and tinnitus involving low to medium frequencies. Although it shows familial aggregation with incomplete phenotypic forms and variable expressivity, most cases are considered sporadic. The aim of this study was to investigate the burden for rare variation in SNHL genes in patients with sporadic MD. We conducted a targeted-sequencing study including SNHL and familial MD genes in 890 MD patients to compare the frequency of rare variants in cases using three independent public datasets as controls. Patients with sporadic MD showed a significant enrichment of missense variants in SNHL genes that was not found in the controls. The list of genes includes <i>GJB2, USH1G, SLC26A4, ESRRB</i>, and <i>CLDN14</i>. A rare synonymous variant with unknown significance was found in the <i>MARVELD2</i> gene in several unrelated patients with MD. There is a burden of rare variation in certain SNHL genes in sporadic MD. Furthermore, the interaction of common and rare variants in SNHL genes may have an additive effect on MD phenotype. This study will contribute to design a gene panel for the genetic diagnosis of MD."	"Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is a common defect in humans. Variants of MARVELD2 at the DFNB49 locus have been shown to cause bilateral, moderate to profound NSHL. However, the role of MARVELD2 in NSHL susceptibility in the Chinese population has not been studied. Here we conducted a case-control study in an eastern Chinese population to profile the spectrum and frequency of MARVELD2 variants, as well as the association of MARVELD2 gene variants with NSHL. Our results showed that variants identified in the Chinese population are significantly different from those reported in Slovak, Hungarian, and Czech Roma, as well as Pakistani families. We identified 11 variants in a cohort of 283 NSHL cases. Through Sanger sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we found that c.730G&gt;A variant has detrimental effects in the eastern Chinese population, and may have relatively high correlation with NSHL pathogenicity."	"Tricellulin is a tight junction (TJ)-forming protein that participates in the sealing function of tricellular TJs. Tricellulin-knockout (Tric-/-) mice show progressive hearing loss with degeneration of hair cells in the cochlea without physiological or physical disorders. In the present study, we investigated the tricellulin expression and its deletion effects in the endolymphatic sac (ES) using Tric-/- mice.The ES epithelia from wild-type (WT) mice were laser-microdissected, and RT-PCR was performed. The ES sections from Tric-/- and WT mice were immunostained with an anti-tricellulin antibody. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for morphological examination. The inner ear of Tric-/- mice was perfused with biotinylation reagents, and the ES sections were observed for tracer permeability assay after applying streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate.The tricellulin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and by immunohistochemistry in the WT ES. The ES in Tric-/- mice showed normal morphology and revealed no biotin leakage from the lumen.The ES in Tric-/- mice showed no changes in morphology or disruption in macromolecular barrier function. The effects of solute leakages in the ES of Tric-/- mice may be very limited and compensatable, or that the ES epithelia may have other sealing system covering the lack of tricellulin."	"Obesity and its metabolic complications are characterized by subclinical systemic and tissue inflammation. In rodent models of obesity, inflammation and metabolic impairments are linked with intestinal barrier damage. However, whether intestinal permeability is altered in human obesity remains to be investigated. In a cohort of 122 severely obese and non-obese patients, we analyzed intestinal barrier function combining in vivo and ex vivo investigations. We found tight junction impairments in the jejunal epithelium of obese patients, evidenced by a reduction of occludin and tricellulin. Serum levels of zonulin and LPS binding protein, two markers usually associated with intestinal barrier alterations, were also increased in obese patients. Intestinal permeability per se was assessed in vivo by quantification of urinary lactitol/mannitol (L/M) and measured directly ex vivo on jejunal samples in Ussing chambers. In the fasting condition, L/M ratio and jejunal permeability were not significantly different between obese and non-obese patients, but high jejunal permeability to small molecules (0.4 kDa) was associated with systemic inflammation within the obese cohort. Altogether, these results suggest that intestinal barrier function is subtly compromised in obese patients. We thus tested whether this barrier impairment could be exacerbated by dietary lipids. To this end, we challenged jejunal samples with lipid micelles and showed that a single exposure increased permeability to macromolecules (4 kDa). Jejunal permeability after the lipid load was two-fold higher in obese patients compared to non-obese controls and correlated with systemic and intestinal inflammation. Moreover, lipid-induced permeability was an explicative variable of type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, intestinal barrier defects are present in human severe obesity and exacerbated by a lipid challenge. This paves the way to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to modulate intestinal barrier function or personalize nutrition therapy to decrease lipid-induced jejunal leakage in metabolic diseases.

"Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensorineural disorder and one of the most common human defects. HL can be classified according to main criteria, including: the site (conductive, sensorineural and mixed), onset (pre-lingual and post-lingual), accompanying signs and symptoms (syndromic and non-syndromic), severity (mild, moderate, severe and profound) and mode of inheritance (Autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked and mitochondrial). Autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL (ARNSHL) forms constitute a major share of the HL cases. In the present study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was applied to investigate the underlying etiology of HL in a multiplex ARNSHL family from Khuzestan province, southwest Iran.In this descriptive study, 20 multiplex ARNSHL families from Khuzestan province, southwest of Iran were recruited. After DNA extraction, genetic linkage analysis (GLA) was applied to screen for a panel of more prevalent loci. One family, which was not linked to these loci, was subjected to Otogenetics deafness Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel.NGS results showed a novel deletion-insertion variant (c.1555delinsAA) in the MARVELD2 gene. The variant which is a frameshift in the seventh exon of the MARVELD2 gene fulfills the criteria of being categorized as pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline.NGS is very promising to identify the molecular etiology of highly heterogeneous diseases such as HL. MARVELD2 might be important in the etiology of HL in this region of Iran."	"The aetiology of Crohn's disease is poorly understood. By investigating twin pairs discordant for Crohn's disease, we aimed to assess whether the dysregulated barrier represents a cause or a consequence of inflammation and to evaluate the impact of genetic predisposition on barrier function.Ileal biopsies from 15 twin pairs discordant for Crohn's disease [monozygotic n = 9, dizygotic n = 6] and 10 external controls were mounted in Ussing chambers to assess paracellular permeability to 51Chromium [Cr]-EDTA and trancellular passage to non-pathogenic E. coli K-12. Experiments were performed with and without provocation with acetylsalicylic acid. Immunofluorescence and ELISA were used to quantify the expression level of tight junction proteins.Healthy co-twins and affected twins displayed increased 51Cr-EDTA permeability at 120 min, both with acetylsalicylic acid [p &lt; 0.001] and without [p &lt; 0.001] when compared with controls. A significant increase in 51Cr-EDTA flux was already seen at 20 min in healthy monozygotic co-twins compared with controls [p≤0.05] when stratified by zygosity, but not in healthy dizygotic co-twins. No difference in E. coli passage was observed between groups. Immunofluorescence of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and tricellulin showed lower levels in healthy co-twins [p &lt; 0.05] and affected twins [p &lt; 0.05] compared with external controls, while ELISA only showed lower tricellulin in Crohn's disease twins [p &lt; 0.05].Our results suggest that barrier dysfunction is a primary defect in Crohn's disease, since changes were predominantly seen in healthy monozygotic co-twins. Passage of E. coli seems to be a consequence of inflammation, rather than representing a primary defect."	"Tricellular tight junctions (tTJs) are specialized structures that occur where the corners of three cells meet to seal adjacent intercellular space. The molecular components of tTJs include tricellulin (TRIC) and lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) which recruits TRIC, are required for normal hearing. Although loss of TRIC causes hearing loss with degeneration of cochlear cells, the detailed mechanisms remains unclear. In the present study, by using temperature-sensitive mouse cochlear cells, US/VOT-E36 cell line, we investigated the changes of TRIC and LSR during cochlear cell differentiation and the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors against cell degeneration induced by loss of TRIC and LSR. During cell differentiation induced by the temperature change, expression of TRIC and LSR were clearly induced. Treatment with metformin enhanced expression TRIC and LSR via AMPK during cell differentiation. Loss of TRIC and LSR by the siRNAs induced cell death in differentiated cells. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A and HDAC6 inhibitor prevented the cell death induced by loss of TRIC and LSR. Collectively, these findings suggest that both tTJ proteins TRIC and LSR have crucial roles for the differentiated cochlear cell survival, and that HDAC inhibitors may be potential therapeutic agents to prevent hearing loss."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Tricellulin, a member of the tight junction-associated MAGUK protein family, preferentially localizes to tricellular junctions in confluent polarized epithelial cell layers and is downregulated during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Posttranslational modifications are assumed to play critical roles in the process of downregulation of tricellulin at the protein level. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch forms a complex with tricellulin and thereby enhances its ubiquitination. Pull-down assays confirmed a direct interaction between tricellulin and Itch, which is mediated by the Itch WW domain and the N-terminus of tricellulin. Experiments in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 did not show major changes in the levels of ubiquitinated tricellulin in epithelial cells, suggesting that ubiquitination is not primarily involved in proteasomal degradation of tricellulin, but it appears to be important for endocytosis or recycling. In contrast, in HEK-293 cells, MG-132 caused polyubiquitination. Moreover, we observed that well-differentiated RT-112 and de-differentiated Cal-29 bladder cancer cells show an inverse expression of tricellulin and Itch. We postulate that ubiquitination is an important posttranslational modification involved in the determination of the intracellular fate of tricellulin deserving of more detailed further investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms and their regulation."	"Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) therapy was shown previously to reduce inflammation-related gut damage from coccidiosis in dairy calves, and feeding of artificial sweetener stimulates GLP-2 secretion from intestinal L cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether GLP-2 treatment or artificial sweetener feeding beginning 1 wk before an experimental inoculation with the coccidian parasite Cryptosporidium parvum can reduce infection-related intestinal damage in Holstein bull calves. Newborn calves were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 6 calves each, including noninfected control calves injected s.c. every 12 h with control buffer (CON), infected control calves injected s.c. every 12 h with control buffer (INF), infected calves injected s.c. every 12 h with 50 µg/kg of body weight of GLP-2 (GLP2), and infected calves injected s.c. every 12 h with control buffer and supplemented in the diet with Sucram (Pancosma, Geneva, Switzerland) at 400 mg/kg of dry matter of milk replacer (SUC). Treatments were initiated on d 1, and calves in INF, GLP2, and SUC were orally dosed on d 8 with 12,500 C. parvum oocysts. Fecal scores were recorded daily, plasma was collected on d 1, 8, 12, 15, and 18 to evaluate markers of inflammation, and fecal samples were collected on d 1, 8, and every other day thereafter to determine the presence of oocysts. Calves were euthanized on d 18 for collection of intestinal tissues and histological and gene expression analyses. Relative to CON, calves in INF exhibited an increase in diarrhea severity, increased plasma serum amyloid A concentration on d 15 and 18, reduced intestinal villus height, increased villus apoptosis and crypt cell proliferation, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of MARVELD2 and GPX2. However, calves in SUC and GLP2 had reduced diarrhea severity and fecal C. parvum oocyst shedding, reduced plasma serum amyloid A concentration on d 15 and 18, and, depending on the intestinal segment, increased villus height, reduced crypt cell proliferation, and reduced mRNA expression of MARVELD2, GPX2, and other tight junction proteins relative to INF. Lastly, GLP2 and SUC exhibited increased intestinal mass-to-length ratio and decreased length-to-empty body weight ratio relative to INF. Our findings suggest that GLP-2 and Sucram treatments administered before a low-level C. parvum exposure may contribute to fewer effects on intestinal integrity, morphology, and inflammation in response to infection, and shorter, denser intestines."	"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex conditions whose pathogenesis may be attributed to gene-environment interactions. There are no definitive mechanisms explaining how environmental triggers can lead to ASD although the involvement of inflammation and immunity has been suggested. Inappropriate antigen trafficking through an impaired intestinal barrier, followed by passage of these antigens or immune-activated complexes through a permissive blood-brain barrier (BBB), can be part of the chain of events leading to these disorders. Our goal was to investigate whether an altered BBB and gut permeability is part of the pathophysiology of ASD.<i>Postmortem</i> cerebral cortex and cerebellum tissues from ASD, schizophrenia (SCZ), and healthy subjects (HC) and duodenal biopsies from ASD and HC were analyzed for gene and protein expression profiles. Tight junctions and other key molecules associated with the neurovascular unit integrity and function and neuroinflammation were investigated.Claudin (<i>CLDN</i>)-5 and -12 were increased in the ASD cortex and cerebellum. <i>CLDN-3</i>, <i>tricellulin</i>, and <i>MMP-9</i> were higher in the ASD cortex. <i>IL-8</i>, <i>tPA</i>, and <i>IBA-1</i> were downregulated in SCZ cortex; <i>IL-1b</i> was increased in the SCZ cerebellum. Differences between SCZ and ASD were observed for most of the genes analyzed in both brain areas. CLDN-5 protein was increased in ASD cortex and cerebellum, while CLDN-12 appeared reduced in both ASD and SCZ cortexes. In the intestine, 75% of the ASD samples analyzed had reduced expression of barrier-forming TJ components (<i>CLDN-1</i>, <i>OCLN</i>, <i>TRIC</i>), whereas 66% had increased pore-forming CLDNs (<i>CLDN-2</i>, <i>-10</i>, <i>-15</i>) compared to controls.In the ASD brain, there is an altered expression of genes associated with BBB integrity coupled with increased neuroinflammation and possibly impaired gut barrier integrity. While these findings seem to be specific for ASD, the possibility of more distinct SCZ subgroups should be explored with additional studies."	"Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) has been identified as a novel molecular constituent of tricellular contacts that have a barrier function for the cellular sheet. LSR recruits tricellulin (TRIC), which is the first molecular component of tricellular tight junctions. Knockdown of LSR increases cell motility and invasion of certain cancer cells. However, the behavior and the roles of LSR in endometrial cancer remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the behavior and roles of LSR in normal and endometrial cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. In endometriosis and endometrial cancer, LSR was observed not only in the subapical region but also throughout the lateral region as well as in normal endometrial epithelial cells in the secretory phase, and LSR in the cancer was reduced in correlation with the malignancy. Knockdown of LSR by the siRNA in cells of the endometrial cancer cell line Sawano, induced cell migration, invasion and proliferation, while TRIC relocalized from the tricellular region to the bicellular region at the membrane. In Sawano cells and normal HEEs, a decrease of LSR induced by leptin and an increase of LSR induced by adiponectin and the drugs for type 2 diabetes metformin and berberine were observed via distinct signaling pathways including JAK2/STAT. In Sawano cells, metformin and berberine prevented cell migration and invasion induced by downregulation of LSR by the siRNA and leptin treatment. The dissection of the mechanism in the downregulation of endometrial LSR during obesity is important in developing new diagnostic and therapy for endometrial cancer. "	"Tricellulin (also known as MARVELD2) is considered as a central component of tricellular tight junctions and is distributed among various epithelial tissues. Although mutations in the gene encoding tricellulin are known to cause deafness in humans (DFNB49) and mice, the influence of its systemic deletion in vivo remains unknown. When we generated tricellulin-knockout mice (Tric(-/-)), we found an early-onset rapidly progressive hearing loss associated with the degeneration of hair cells (HCs); however, their body size and overall appearance were normal. Tric(-/-) mice did not show any morphological change pertaining to other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, thyroid gland and heart. The endocochlear potential (EP) was normal in Tric(-/-) mice, suggesting that the tight junction barrier is maintained in the stria vascularis, where EP is generated. The degeneration of HCs, which occurred after the maturation of EP, was prevented in the culture medium with an ion concentration similar to that of the perilymph. These data demonstrate the specific requirement of tricellulin for maintaining ion homeostasis around cochlear HCs to ensure their survival. The Tric(-/-) mouse provides a new model for understanding the distinct roles of tricellulin in different epithelial systems as well as in the pathogenesis of DFNB49. "	"Comprehensive genetic testing has the potential to become the standard of care for individuals with hearing loss. In this study, we investigated the genetic etiology of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in a Turkish cohort including individuals with cochlear implant, who had a pedigree suggestive of an autosomal recessive inheritance. A workflow including prescreening of GJB2 and a targeted next generation sequencing panel (Illumına TruSightTM Exome) covering 2761 genes that we briefly called as mendelian exome sequencing was used. This panel includes 102 deafness genes and a number of genes causing Mendelian disorders. Using this approach, we identified causative variants in 21 of 29 families. Three different GJB2 variants were present in seven families. Remaining 14 families had 15 different variants in other known NSHL genes (MYO7A, MYO15A, MARVELD2, TMIE, DFNB31, LOXHD1, GPSM2, TMC1, USH1G, CDH23). Of these variants, eight are novel. Mutation detection rate of our workflow is 72.4%, confirming the usefulness of targeted sequencing approach in NSHL."	"Tight junctions (TJs) seal paracellular clefts in epithelia/endothelia and form tissue barriers for proper organ function. TJ-associated marvel proteins (TAMPs; tricellulin, occludin, marvelD3) are thought to be relevant to regulation. Under normal conditions, tricellulin tightens tricellular junctions against macromolecules. Traces of tricellulin occur in bicellular junctions.As pathological disturbances have not been analyzed, the structure and function of human tricellulin, including potentially redox-sensitive Cys sites, were investigated under reducing/oxidizing conditions at 3- and 2-cell contacts.Ischemia, hypoxia, and reductants redistributed tricellulin from 3- to 2-cell contacts. The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2; conserved Cys321, Cys335) trans-oligomerized between three opposing cells. Substitutions of these residues caused bicellular localization. Cys362 in transmembrane domain 4 contributed to bicellular heterophilic cis-interactions along the cell membrane with claudin-1 and marvelD3, while Cys395 in the cytosolic C-terminal tail promoted homophilic tricellullar cis-interactions. The Cys sites included in homo-/heterophilic bi-/tricellular cis-/trans-interactions contributed to cell barrier tightness for small/large molecules.Tricellulin forms TJs via trans- and cis-association in 3-cell contacts, as demonstrated electron and quantified fluorescence microscopically; it tightens 3- and 2-cell contacts. Tricellulin's ECL2 specifically seals 3-cell contacts redox dependently; a structural model is proposed.TAMP ECL2 and claudins' ECL1 share functionally and structurally similar features involved in homo-/heterophilic tightening of cell-cell contacts. Tricellulin is a specific redox sensor and sealing element at 3-cell contacts and may compensate as a redox mediator for occludin loss at 2-cell contacts in vivo and in vitro. Molecular interaction mechanisms were proposed that contribute to tricellulin's function. In conclusion, tricellulin is a junctional redox regulator for ischemia-related alterations."	"In the present study we aimed: 1) To establish the prevalence and clinical impact of DFNB49 mutations in deaf Roma from 2 Central European countries (Slovakia and Hungary), and 2) to analyze a possible common origin of the c.1331+2T&gt;C mutation among Roma and Pakistani mutation carriers identified in the present and previous studies.We sequenced 6 exons of the MARVELD2 gene in a group of 143 unrelated hearing impaired Slovak Roma patients. Simultaneously, we used RFLP to detect the c.1331+2T&gt;C mutation in 85 Hungarian deaf Roma patients, control groups of 702 normal hearing Romanies from both countries and 375 hearing impaired Slovak Caucasians. We analyzed the haplotype using 21 SNPs spanning a 5.34Mb around the mutation c.1331+2T&gt;C.One pathogenic mutation (c.1331+2T&gt;C) was identified in 12 homozygous hearing impaired Roma patients. Allele frequency of this mutation was higher in Hungarian (10%) than in Slovak (3.85%) Roma patients. The identified common haplotype in Roma patients was defined by 18 SNP markers (3.89 Mb). Fourteen common SNPs were also shared among Pakistani and Roma homozygotes. Biallelic mutation carriers suffered from prelingual bilateral moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss.We demonstrate different frequencies of the c.1331+2T&gt;C mutation in hearing impaired Romanies from 3 Central European countries. In addition, our results provide support for the hypothesis of a possible common ancestor of the Slovak, Hungarian and Czech Roma as well as Pakistani deaf patients. Testing for the c.1331+2T&gt;C mutation may be recommended in GJB2 negative Roma cases with early-onset sensorineural hearing loss."	"Pathogenic mutations of MARVELD2, encoding tricellulin, a tricelluar tight junction protein, cause autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB49) in families of Pakistan and Czech Roma origin. In fact, they are a significant cause of prelingual hearing loss in the Czech Roma, second only to GJB2 variants. Previously, we reported that mice homozygous for p.Arg497* variant of Marveld2 had a broad phenotypic spectrum, where defects were observed in the inner ear, heart, mandibular salivary gland, thyroid gland and olfactory epithelium. The current study describes the types and frequencies of MARVELD2 alleles and clinically reexamines members of DFNB49 families. We found that MARVELD2 variants are responsible for about 1.5 % (95 % CI 0.8-2.6) of non-syndromic hearing loss in our cohort of 800 Pakistani families. The c.1331+2T&gt;C allele is recurrent. In addition, we identified a novel large deletion in a single family, which appears to have resulted from non-allelic homologous recombination between two similar Alu short interspersed elements. Finally, we observed no other clinical manifestations co-segregating with hearing loss in DFNB49 human families, and hypothesize that the additional abnormalities in the Marveld2 mutant mouse indicates a critical non-redundant function for tricellulin in other organ systems."	"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence is spiraling globally, and knowledge of its pathophysiological signatures is crucial for a better understanding and treatment of the disease.We aimed to discover underlying coding genetic variants influencing fasting serum levels of nine biomarkers associated with T2D: adiponectin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, heat shock 70-kDa protein 1B, IGF binding protein 1 and IGF binding protein 2, IL-18, IL-2 receptor-α, and leptin.A population-based sample of 6215 adult Danes was genotyped for 16 340 coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms and were tested for association with each biomarker. Identified loci were tested for association with T2D through a large-scale meta-analysis involving up to 17 024 T2D cases and up to 64 186 controls.We discovered 11 associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and five distinct biomarkers at a study-wide P &lt; 3.4 × 10(-7). Nine associations were novel: IL18: BIRC6, RAD17, MARVELD2; ferritin: F5; IGF binding protein 1: SERPING1, KLKB, GCKR, CELSR2, and heat shock 70-kDa protein 1B: CFH. Three of the identified loci (CELSR2, HNF1A, and GCKR) were significantly associated with T2D, of which the association with the CELSR2 locus has not been shown previously.The identified loci influence processes related to insulin signaling, cell communication, immune function, apoptosis, DNA repair, and oxidative stress, all of which could provide a rationale for novel diabetes therapeutic strategies."

"MYO15A"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is an extremely heterogeneous disorder. Thus, clinical diagnostics is challenging, in particular due to differences in the etiology of hearing loss between populations. With this study, we wanted to elucidate the genetic basis of hearing loss in 61 consanguineous Egyptian families. In 25 families, linkage analysis was used as a prescreening to identify regions for targeted sequencing of candidate genes. Initially, the coding regions of 12 and later of 94 genes associated with hearing loss were enriched and subjected to massively parallel sequencing (MPS) with diagnostic yields of 36% and 75%, respectively. Causative variants were identified in 48 families (79%). They were found in 23 different genes with the majority being located in MYO15A (15.3%), SLC26A4 (9.7%), GJB2 (8.3%), and MYO7A (6.4%). As many as 32 variants were novel ones at the time of detection. Five variants were shared by two, three, or even four families. Our study provides a first survey of the mutational spectrum of deaf patients in Egypt revealing less GJB2 variants than in many European populations. It underlines the value of targeted enrichment of well-selected deafness genes in combination with MPS in the diagnostics of this frequent and genetically heterogeneous disorder."	"To determine the type and carrier rate of deafness-related variants in Dongguan, China.A total of 16 182 subjects were screened. Heel blood samples were collected from newborns, while peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the remainders. For each individual, 100 variations of 18 deafness susceptibility genes were detected.In total 1631 deafness-related variants (including 5 homozygous mutations) were detected, which gave a detection rate of 10.08%. The detection rate of SLC26A4 gene variants was the highest (845 cases, 5.22%), which was followed by GJB2 (673 cases, 4.16%), GJB3 (100 cases, 0.62%), TMC1 (12 cases, 0.07%), and MYO15A (1 case, 0.01%). The detection rate for GJB2 c.235delC variant was the highest (524 cases, 3.24%), which was followed by SLC26A4 IVS7-2A&gt;G variant (270 cases, 1.67%). Thirty three individuals (0.20%) carried two variants at the same time, 7 of them (0.04%) carried compound heterozygous variants of the same gene.To expand the range of screening can help with determination of the carrier status and provision of early intervention and genetic counseling for the examinees."	"<b>Background:</b> Recent advances in less-invasive surgery and electrode design allow for a high degree of hearing preservation (HP) after cochlear implantation (CI), although residual hearing still deteriorates in some patients. To date, the factors predictive of preserving residual hearing remain a controversial topic.<b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive factors, including the etiology of hearing loss (HL) as a patient-related factor, influencing residual HP after CI.<b>Methods:</b> Forty-four patients (50 ears, 41 families) with residual acoustic hearing who underwent CI were included. Auditory thresholds before and at 6 months after initial activation were measured. Genetic testing was performed to identify the responsible genes for HL.<b>Results:</b> We identified the cause of HL in 21 families (51.2%). HP was marginally correlated with age at implantation, while it was independent of pre-operative low-frequency hearing thresholds, cochlear duct length, and electrode length. We found that patients who had pathogenic variants in the <i>CDH23</i>, <i>MYO7A</i>, or <i>MYO15A</i> gene showed statistically better HP scores compared with patients with HL due to other causes (<i>p</i> = .002).<b>Conclusions:</b> Identification of the etiology of HL using genetic testing is likely to facilitate the prediction of HP after implant surgery."	"<b>Background:</b> Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory disorder in humans, which affects individuals in both inherited and acquired forms. MYO15A and MYO7A gene mutations have a significant role in the development of deafness. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of MYO15A and MYO7A mutations in one hundred non-relative deaf Iranians. <b>Materials and methods:</b> The existence of MYO15A and MYO7A mutations were assessed using the tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method, High Resolution Melting (HRM) and sequencing method. <b>Results:</b> A heterozygote missense mutation, p.V2135L (c.6403G &gt; T) in the MYO15A gene, was found in a patient using the sequencing method. <b>Conclusion:</b> These results explain the negligible prevalence of selected mutations among Iranian patients. Identifying common mutations in patients of an ethnic group can reduce the financial costs and time needed for identifying the causes of deafness."	"Recessive mutations in GJB2 is the most common cause of genetic hearing loss worldwide. The aim of this study is to determine the spectrum and frequency of GJB2 variants in Chinese Han deaf patients and to investigate the underlying causative genes in patients with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.We analyzed the mutation screening results of GJB2 in 1852 Chinese Han probands with apparently autosomal-recessive hearing loss in our laboratory. Targeted next-generation sequencing of 139 known deafness-related genes were performed in 44 probands with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.Bi-allelic GJB2 mutations was identified in 25.65% of patients, in which the c.235delC (p.L79Cfs*3) mutation is the most frequent cause for both severe-to-profound (84.93%) and mild-to-moderate hearing loss (54.05%), while the c.109G &gt; A (p.V37I) mutation is another frequent cause for mild-to-moderate hearing loss (40.54%). In 3.89% of patients only one mutant allele can be identified in GJB2. Targeted next generation sequencing in 44 such probands revealed digenic heterozygous mutations in GJB2/GJB6 and GJB2/GJB3 as the likely pathogenic mechanism in three probands. In 13 probands, on the other hand, pathogenic mutations in other deafness-associated genes (STRC, EYA1, MITF, PCDH15, USH2A, MYO15A, CDH23, OTOF, SLC26A4, SMPX, and TIMM8A) can be identified as the independent genetic cause, suggesting that the mono-allelic GJB2 mutations in those probands is likely co-incidental.Our results demonstrated that GJB2 should be a primary target for mutation screening in Chinese Han deaf patients, and those with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations should be further screened by next generation sequencing."	"Actin-rich structures, like stereocilia and microvilli, are assembled with precise control of length, diameter, and relative spacing. By quantifying actin-core dimensions of stereocilia from phalloidin-labeled mouse cochleas, we demonstrated that inner hair cell stereocilia developed in specific stages, where a widening phase is sandwiched between two lengthening phases. Moreover, widening of the second-tallest stereocilia rank (row 2) occurred simultaneously with the appearance of mechanotransduction. Correspondingly, Tmc1<sup>KO/KO</sup>;Tmc2<sup>KO/KO</sup> or Tmie<sup>KO/KO</sup> hair cells, which lack transduction, have significantly altered stereocilia lengths and diameters, including a narrowed row 2. EPS8 and the short splice isoform of MYO15A, identity markers for mature row 1 (the tallest row), lost their row exclusivity in transduction mutants. GNAI3, another member of the mature row 1 complex, accumulated at mutant row 1 tips at considerably lower levels than in wild-type bundles. Alterations in stereocilia dimensions and in EPS8 distribution seen in transduction mutants were mimicked by block of transduction channels of cochlear explants in culture. In addition, proteins normally concentrated at mature row 2 tips were also distributed differently in transduction mutants; the heterodimeric capping protein subunit CAPZB and its partner TWF2 never concentrated at row 2 tips like they do in wild-type bundles. The altered distribution of marker proteins in transduction mutants was accompanied by increased variability in stereocilia length. Transduction channels thus specify and maintain row identity, control addition of new actin filaments to increase stereocilia diameter, and coordinate stereocilia height within rows."	"Hearing loss (HL) represents the most common congenital sensory impairment with an incidence of 1-5 per 1000 live births. Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is an isolated finding that is not part of any other disorder accounting for 70% of all genetic hearing loss cases.In the current study, we reported a polygenic mode of inheritance in an NSHL consanguineous family using exome sequencing technology and we evaluated the possible effect of the detected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using in silico methods.Two bi-allelic SNVs were detected in the affected patients; a MYO15A (. p.V485A) variant, and a novel MITF (p.P338L) variant. Along with these homozygous mutations, we detected two heterozygous variants in well described hearing loss genes (MYO7A and MYH14). The novel MITF p. Pro338Leu missense mutation was predicted to change the protein structure and function.A novel MITF mutation along with a previously described MYO15A mutation segregate with an autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL case with a post-lingual onset. The findings highlight the importance of carrying whole exome sequencing for a comprehensive assessment of HL genetic heterogeneity."	"Diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss (HHL) as a heterogeneous disorder is very important especially in countries with high rates of consanguinity where the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance is prevalent. Techniques such as next-generation sequencing, a comprehensive genetic test using targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE + MPS), have made the diagnosis more cost-effective. The aim of this study was to determine HHL variants with comprehensive genetic testing in our country.Fifty <i>GJB2</i> negative individuals with HHL were referred to the Kariminejad-Najmabadi Pathology and Genetics Center, Tehran, one of the reference diagnostic genetic laboratories in Iran, during a 3-year period between 2014 and 2017. They were screened with the OtoSCOPE test, the targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE + MPS) platform after a detailed history had been taken along with clinical evaluation.Among 32 out of 50 <i>GJB2</i> negative patients (64%), 34 known pathogenic and novel variants were detected of which 16 (47%) were novel, identified in 10 genes of which the most prevalent were <i>CDH23, MYO7A</i> and <i>MYO15A.</i>These results provide a foundation from which to make appropriate recommendations for the use of comprehensive genetic testing in the evaluation of Iranian patients with hereditary hearing loss."	"Hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder affecting approximately 360 million people worldwide and is among the most common sensorineural disorders. Here, we report a genetic analysis of seven large consanguineous families segregating prelingual sensorineural hearing loss. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed seven different pathogenic variants segregating with hearing loss in these families, three novel variants (c.1204G&gt;A, c.322G&gt;T, and c.5587C&gt;T) in <i>TMPRSS3, ESRRB,</i> and <i>OTOF</i>, and four previously reported variants (c.208C&gt;T, c.6371G&gt;A, c.226G&gt;A, and c.494C&gt;T) in <i>LRTOMT</i>, <i>MYO15A</i>, <i>KCNE1</i>, and <i>LHFPL5</i>, respectively<i>.</i> All identified variants had very low frequencies in the control databases and were predicted to have pathogenic effects on the encoded proteins. In addition to being familial, we also found intersibship locus heterogeneity in the evaluated families. The known pathogenic c.226C&gt;T variant identified in <i>KCNE1</i> only segregates with the hearing loss phenotype in a subset of affected members of the family GCNF21. This study further highlights the challenges of identifying disease-causing variants for highly heterogeneous disorders and reports the identification of three novel and four previously reported variants in seven known deafness genes."	"Neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a diagnostic challenge. A full term, small for gestational age boy presented with cholestasis, hypoglycemia, hyperferritinemia and severe bilateral deafness. Diagnostic work-up revealed two hereditary diseases: alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (PI*ZZ genotype) and autosomal recessive deafness type 3 (compound heterozygous MYO15A gene mutation). In addition, we found late hypoglycemia on full enteral feeding which complicated this case. Hyperferritinemia is an uncommon finding in newborn cholestasis without liver failure."	"To observe differential peptidomics in the hippocampal tissue in a rat model of premature white matter injury, and to investigate the mechanism of premature white matter injury.Twenty neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and equally divided into a control group and a model group. Rats in the model group underwent permanent ligation of the right common carotid artery 2 days after birth, followed by 2 hours of hypoxia. For rats in the control group, the right common carotid artery was isolated, but without ligation and hypoxia. Brain tissue samples were collected from the two groups, and hippocampal tissue was isolated. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with tandem mass spectrometry was used for peptidomic profiling of hippocampal tissue, and the differentially expressed peptides between the two groups were subjected to bioinformatics analysis to assess their possible roles in neural development and function.A total of 4164 peptides were identified and quantified, and 262 of them were differentially expressed (absolute fold change ≥2.5), including 164 upregulated peptides and 98 downregulated peptides. The numbers of differentially expressed peptides of the precursor proteins ELN, PCLO, MYO15a, MAP4, and MAP1b were the most, and may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of premature white matter injury. CDK5 signaling pathway in the hippocampus was activated in the rat model of premature white matter injury.The differentially expressed peptides related to precursor proteins such as MAP1b may be key bioactive peptides involved in neural development and function in premature white matter injury, and activation of the CDK5 signaling pathway may be associated with premature white matter injury."	"To link congenital hearing loss with known loci to establish a platform for future research.The cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2016 to March 2017 in Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and comprised families with Pashtun ethnicity having at least 2 individuals suffering from congenital hearing loss. Deoxyribonucleic acid from whole blood samples was extracted by salting-out method. Amplification was done through touchdown polymerase chain reaction to see any possible linkage to already reported deafness loci. Linkage analysis was carried out using microsatellite markers for each locus. Genotyping of the samples was done and haplotypes were accordingly generated to either include or exclude the linked / unlinked regions.Of the 4 families, family PKDF 1620 showed linkage with DFNB12/CDH23 (D10S1432, D10S606, and D10S1694) and family PKDF 1625 had linkage with DFNB3/MYO15A (D17S2196, D17S2207 and D17S2206). Families PKDF1623 and PKDF1624 showed no linkage with any of the prevalent reported loci in Pakistan .Linkage to DFNB12 and MYO 15 showed heterogeneity of congenital deafness."	"Hereditary hearing impairment (HHI) is a common but heterogeneous clinical entity caused by mutations in a plethora of deafness genes. Research over the past few decades has shown that the genetic epidemiology of HHI varies significantly across populations. In this study, we used different genetic examination strategies to address the genetic causes of HHI in a large Taiwanese cohort composed of &gt;5000 hearing-impaired families. We also analyzed the clinical features associated with specific genetic mutations. Our results demonstrated that next-generation sequencing-based examination strategies could achieve genetic diagnosis in approximately half of the families. Common deafness-associated genes in the Taiwanese patients assessed, in the order of prevalence, included GJB2, SLC26A4, OTOF, MYO15A, and MTRNR1, which were similar to those found in other populations. However, the Taiwanese patients had some unique mutations in these genes. These findings may have important clinical implications for refining molecular diagnostics, facilitating genetic counseling, and enabling precision medicine for the management of HHI."	"The most common injury of preterm infants is periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and to date there is still no safe and effective treatment. In our previous studies, leptin has been found to have neuroprotective effects on the preterm ischemia-hypoxia brain damage model rats in animal behavior. To gain insight into the neuroprotective mechanisms of leptin on preterm brain damage model rats, we constructed a comparative peptidomic profiling of hippocampal tissue between leptin-treated after model and preterm ischemia-hypoxia brain damage model rats using a stable isobaric labeling strategy involving tandem mass tag reagents, followed by nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We identified and quantified 4164 peptides, 238 of which were differential expressed in hippocampal tissue in the two groups. A total of 150 peptides were up regulated and 88 peptides were down regulated. These peptides were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and identified putative roles in nervous system development, function and diseases. We concluded that the preterm ischemia-hypoxia brain damage model with leptin treatment induced peptides changes in hippocampus, and these peptides, especially for the peptides associated &quot;microtubule-associated protein 1b (MAP1b), Elastin (Eln), Piccolo presynaptic cytomatrix protein (Pclo), Zinc finger homeobox 3(Zfhx3), Alpha-kinase 3(Alpk3) and Myosin XVA(Myo15a) &quot;, could be candidate bio-active peptides and participate in neuroprotection of leptin. These may advance our current understanding of the mechanism of leptin's neuroprotective effect on preterm brain damage and may be involved in the etiology of preterm brain damage. Meanwhile, we found that repression of ILK signaling pathway plays a significant role in neuroprotection of leptin. A better understanding of the role of ILK signaling pathway in neuroprotective mechanisms will help scientists and researchers to develop selective, safe and efficacious drug for therapy against human nervous system disorders."	"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a genetically heterogeneous sensorineural disorder with an approximate incidence of 1.4:1000 in neonates. Mutations in more than 60 genes including the <i>MYO15A</i> gene has been reported in patients affected with ARNSHL. In the present study, we report a novel <i>MYO15A</i> mutation identified by clinical exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in a consanguineous Iranian family with ARNSHL.A 22-year-old woman with congenital non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss referred to our medical genetic center. Her parents were consanguineous with F = 1/16 (first cousin), and clinical examination of the patient exclude dysmorphic features. Sanger sequencing of <i>GJB2</i> and <i>GJB6</i> genes, which are the most common causes of ARNSHL, was negative. Then she underwent clinical exome sequencing.We found a novel homozygote variant (c.9611_9612+8delTGGTGAGCAT) in the <i>MYO15A</i> gene which creates a shift in the reading frame starting at codon 3204. This variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the patient and also in her parents who were heterozygous.The present results suggest that the homozygous <i>MYO15A</i> (c.9611_9612+8delTGGTGAGCAT) variant is a pathogenic mutation and to the best of our knowledge, this mutation has not been reported in any database."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a highly heterogeneous disease involving more than 70 pathogenic genes. However, most ARNSHL families have small-sized pedigrees with limited genetic information, rendering challenges for the molecular diagnosis of these patients. Therefore, we attempted to establish a strategy for identifying deleterious variants associated with ARNSHL by applying proband whole-exome sequencing (proband-WES). Aside from desiring to improve molecular diagnostic rates, we also aimed to search for novel deafness genes shared by patients with similar phenotype, making up for the deficiency of small ARNSHL families. In this study, 48.5% (16/33) families were detected the pathogenic variants in eight known deafness genes, including 10 novel variants identified in <i>TMPRSS3</i> (MIM 605551), <i>MYO15A</i> (MIM 602666), <i>TMC1</i> (MIM 606706), <i>ADGRV1</i> (MIM 602851), and <i>PTPRQ</i> (MIM 603317). Apart from six novel variants with a truncating effect (nonsense, deletion, insertion, and splice-site), four novel missense variants were not found in 200 unrelated control population by using Sanger sequencing. It is important to note that none of novel genes were shared across different pedigrees, indicating that a larger sample size might be needed. Proband-WES is a cost-effective and precise way of identifying causative variants in nuclear families with ARNSHL. This economical strategy may be appropriated as a clinical application to provide molecular diagnostics, genetic counseling, and individualized health maintenance measures for patients with ARNSHL at hearing clinics."	"<b>:</b> Hearing loss (HL) is a common sensory disorder affecting over 5% of the global population. The etiology underlying HL includes congenital and acquired causes; genetic factors are the main cause in over 50% of congenital cases. Pathogenic variants in the <i>GJB2</i> gene are a major cause of congenital non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL), while their distribution is highly heterogeneous in different populations. To the best of our knowledge, there is no data regarding the genetic etiologies of HL in Peru. In this study, we screened 133 Peruvian families with NSHL living in Lima. We sequenced both exons of the <i>GJB2</i> gene for all probands. Seven probands with familial NSHL that remained negative for <i>GJB2</i> variants underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS). We identified biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>GJB2</i> in 43 probands; seven were heterozygous for only one allele. The c.427C&gt;T variant was the most common pathogenic variant followed by the c.35delG variant. WGS revealed three novel variants in <i>MYO15A</i> in two probands, one of them was predicted to affect splicing and the others produce a premature stop codon. The Peruvian population showed a complex profile for genetic variants in the <i>GJB2</i> gene, this particular profile might be a consequence of the admixture history in Peru."	"Millions of people around the world are plagued by hearing loss. More than 50% of congenital or pre-lingual deafness is associated with genetic factors and has highly genetic heterogeneity. To date, although hundreds of genes have been found to be implicated in non-syndromic deafness, there are still lots of genes or loci that we need to verify.In this study, we performed target sequencing and Sanger sequencing in a Kazakh consanguineous family with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. Following that, functional and structural studies predicted the pathogenic effect of novel mutations by use of the online tools.We identified a novel homozygous mutation p.R3191C in MYO15A gene causing deafness in this family. The mutation p.R3191C co-segregated with the disease phenotype in this family and was not present in any public databases. Automatic tools predict that the novel mutation makes a great impact on the function and structure of MYO15A protein.This is a novel mutation of MYO15A causing deafness and also the first report of MYO15A mutations causing deafness in the Kazakh families. This finding expanded the spectrum of MYO15A mutations, making it more precise for future genetic diagnosis in patients with deafness."	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is the most common sensorineural disorder and one of the most common human defects. Autosomal recessive inheritance accounts for a huge percentage of familial cases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful molecular diagnostic strategy for NSHL. The combination of a microarray gene chip and NGS can better delineate the etiology and genetic cause of deafness in many cases.One hundred and thirty-one unrelated students with NSHL who attend a special education school in Yunnan Province were recruited. Firstly, four common deafness-related genes (GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 12S rRNA) were evaluated for mutations using a microarray kit. Furthermore, 227 known human deafness genes were sequenced to identify the responsible genetic variant of the proband in three Chinese families with autosomal recessive hearing loss. The mutational status of family members of the probands was validated by Sanger sequencing.Five novel variants were found in three families using NGS. In family 1, we identified compound heterozygosity at the MYO15A (OMIM, #600316), including an duplication variant c.3866dupC, p.His1290Alafs*25 and a 3-bp deletion (c.10251_10253del, p.Phe3420del), resulting in protein length changes and premature protein truncation, respectively. In family 2, two affected siblings from a consanguineous Chinese Dai family harbored an c.1274G&gt;C, p.Arg425Pro missense variant in the OTOF (OMIM, #601071). In family 3, we identified compound heterozygosity for c.129_130del, p.His43Glnfs*28 and c.76_79del, p.Lys26* in the RDX gene (OMIM, #611022).Five novel variants were found in three families with NSHL. Our findings extend the mutational spectrum in deafness-related genes and will help physicians in better understanding the etiology of hearing loss."
"MYO3A"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"We have previously reported on a consanguineous family where 2 siblings, a girl and a boy, presented with tall stature, long and triangular faces, prominent forehead, telecanthus, ptosis, everted lower eyelids, downslanting palpebral fissures, large ears, high arched palate, long arm span, arachnodactyly, advanced bone age, joint laxity, pectus excavatum, inguinal hernia, and myopia, suggestive of a new subtype of connective tissue disorder (Megarbane et al. AJMG, 2012; 158(A)5: 1185-1189). On clinical follow-up, both patients had multiple inguinal, crural, and abdominal herniae, intestinal occlusions, several huge diverticula throughout the gut and the bladder, and rectal prolapse. In addition, the girl had a mild hearing impairment, and the boy a left diaphragmatic hernia. Here we describe the molecular characterization of this disorder using Whole Exome Sequencing, revealing, in both siblings, a novel homozygous missense variant in the EFEMP1 gene, c.163T &gt; C; p.(Cys55Arg) whose homozygous by descent, autosomal recessive transmission was confirmed through segregation analysis by Sanger sequencing. In addition, the girl exhibited a homozygous mutation in the MYO3A gene, c.1370_1371delGA; p.(Arg457Asnfs*25), associated with non-syndromic deafness. The siblings were also found to harbor a homozygous nonsense variant in the VCPKMT gene. We review the literature and discuss our updated clinical and molecular findings that suggest EFEMP1 to be the probable candidate gene implicated in this novel connective tissue disease."	"In this issue of Structure, Li et al. (2019) describe the structure of the MORN4-Myo3a complex, revealing that the MORN repeats in MORN4 form a single-layer antiparallel β sheet and employs an extensive surface area in binding Myo3a. Their findings suggest that single-layer β sheets are versatile protein-binding modules."	"Tandem repeats are basic building blocks for constructing proteins with diverse structures and functions. Compared with extensively studied α-helix-based tandem repeats such as ankyrin, tetratricopeptide, armadillo, and HEAT repeat proteins, relatively little is known about tandem repeat proteins formed by β hairpins. In this study, we discovered that the MORN repeats from MORN4 function as a protein binding module specifically recognizing a tail cargo binding region from Myo3a. The structure of the MORN4/Myo3a complex shows that MORN4 forms an extended single-layered β-sheet structure and uses a U-shaped groove to bind to the Myo3a tail with high affinity and specificity. Sequence and structural analyses further elucidated the unique sequence features for folding and target binding of MORN repeats. Our work establishes that the β-hairpin-based MORN repeats are protein-protein interaction modules."	"Literature review of the genetic etiology of hearing loss (HL) in the African American (AA) population.PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL were accessed from 1966 to 2018.PRISMA guidelines were followed. Search terms included permutations of &quot;hearing loss,&quot; &quot;African American,&quot; &quot;black,&quot; and &quot;genetic&quot;; &quot;African American&quot; was then cross-referenced against documented HL genes. AA subjects included in multiethnic cohorts of genetic HL testing were identified by searching the key terms &quot;hearing loss&quot; and &quot;ethnic cohort&quot; and &quot;genetic.&quot; The Q-Genie tool was used in the quality assessment of included studies. An allele frequency meta-analysis of pathogenic GJB2 variants in the AA population was performed and stratified by hearing status.Four hundred seventeen articles were reviewed, and 26 met our inclusion criteria. Ten studies were included in the GJB2 meta-analysis. In the general AA population, pathogenic GJB2 variants are rare, including the 35delG allele, which displayed a carrier frequency of 0.05%. Pathogenic variants were discovered in seven nonsyndromic HL genes (GJB2, MYO3A, TECTA, STRC, OTOF, MYH14, TMC1), eight syndromic HL genes, and one mitochondrial HL gene. Recent comprehensive genetic testing using custom genetic HL testing platforms has yielded only a 26% molecular diagnosis rate for HL etiologies in the AA population.Investigators should be encouraged to provide an ethnic breakdown of results. Sparse literature and poor diagnosis rates indicate that genes involved in HL in the AA population have yet to be identified. Future explorative investigations using next-generation sequencing technologies, such as whole-exome sequencing, into the AA population are warranted."	"To explore the molecular epidemiology of rare deafness genes in Taiwanese sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) patients with cochlear implantation (CI) by performing massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and correlating genetic factors and CI outcomes.We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes.Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes.We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI."	"Myo3a is expressed in cochlear hair cells and retinal cells and is responsible for human recessive hereditary nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB30). To investigate the mechanism of DFNB30-type deafness, we established a mouse model of Myo3a kinase domain Y137C mutation by using CRISPR/Cas9 system. No difference in hearing between 2-month-old Myo3a mutant mice and wild-type mice was observed. The hearing threshold of the ≥6-month-old mutant mice was significantly elevated compared with that of the wild-type mice. We observed degeneration in the inner ear hair cells of 6-month-old Myo3a mutant mice, and the degeneration became more severe at the age of 12 months. We also found structural abnormality in the cochlear hair cell stereocilia. Our results showed that Myo3a is essential for normal hearing by maintaining the intact structure of hair cell stereocilia, and the kinase domain plays a critical role in the normal functions of Myo3a. This mouse line is an excellent model for studying DFNB30-type deafness in humans."	"Whole-exome sequencing of samples from affected members of two unrelated families with late-onset non-syndromic hearing loss revealed a novel mutation (c.2090 T &gt; G; NM_017433) in MYO3A. The mutation was confirmed in 36 affected individuals, showing autosomal dominant inheritance. The mutation alters a single residue (L697W or p.Leu697Trp) in the motor domain of the stereocilia protein MYO3A, leading to a reduction in ATPase activity, motility, and an increase in actin affinity. MYO3A-L697W showed reduced filopodial actin protrusion initiation in COS7 cells, and a predominant tipward accumulation at filopodia and stereocilia when coexpressed with wild-type MYO3A and espin-1, an actin-regulatory MYO3A cargo. The combined higher actin affinity and duty ratio of the mutant myosin cause increased retention time at stereocilia tips, resulting in the displacement of the wild-type MYO3A protein, which may impact cargo transport, stereocilia length, and mechanotransduction. The dominant negative effect of the altered myosin function explains the dominant inheritance of deafness."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Hearing loss is the most common sensorineural disorder worldwide and is associated with more than 1000 mutations in more than 90 genes. While mutations in genes such as GJB2 (gap-junction protein β 2) and GJB6 (gap-junction protein β 6) are highly prevalent in Caucasian, Asian, and Middle Eastern populations, they are rare in both native African populations and those of African descent. The objective of this paper is to review the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology and genetics of hearing loss in African populations with a focus on native sub-Saharan African populations. Environmental etiologies related to poor access to healthcare and perinatal care account for the majority of cases. Syndromic etiologies including Waardenburg, Pendred and Usher syndromes are uncommon causes of hearing loss in these populations. Of the non-syndromic causes, common mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 are rarely implicated in populations of African descent. Recent use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has identified several candidate deafness genes in African populations from Nigeria and South Africa that are unique when compared to common causative mutations worldwide. Researchers also recently described a dominant mutation in MYO3a in an African American family with non-syndromic hearing loss. The use of NGS and specialized panels will aid in identifying rare and novel mutations in a more cost- and time-effective manner. The identification of common hearing loss mutations in indigenous African populations will pave the way for translation into genetic deafness research in populations of African descent worldwide."	"The potential of a tumor cell to metastasize profoundly depends on its microenvironment, or &quot;niche&quot; interactions with local components. Tumor-associated-macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant subpopulation of tumor stroma and represent a key component of tumor microenvironment. The dynamic interaction of cancer cells with neighboring TAMs actively drive cancer progression and metastatic transformation through intercellular signaling networks that need better elucidation. Thus, current study was planned for discerning paracrine communication networks operational between TAMs, and breast cancer cells with special reference to cancer cell invasion and dissemination to distant sites. Here, we report role of MIP-1β in enhancing invasive potential of metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. In addition, the poorly metastatic MCF-7 cells were also rendered invasive by MIP-1β. The MIP-1β-driven cancer cell invasion was dependent on upregulated expression levels of MYO3A gene, which encodes an unconventional myosin super-family protein harboring a kinase domain. Ex ovo study employing Chick-embryo-model and in vivo Syngenic 4T1/BALB/c mice-model further corroborated aforementioned in vitro findings, thereby substantiating their physiological relevance. Concordantly, human breast cancer specimen exhibited significant association between mRNA expression levels of MIP-1β and MYO3A. Both, MIP-1β and MYO3A exhibited positive correlation with MMP9, an established molecular determinant of cancer cell invasion. Higher expression of these genes correlated with poor survival of breast cancer patients. Collectively, these results point toward so far undisclosed MIP-1β/MYO3A axis being operational during metastasis, wherein macrophage-derived MIP-1β potentiated cancer cell invasion and metastasis via up regulation of MYO3A gene within cancer cells. Our study exposes opportunities for devising potential anti-metastatic strategies for efficient clinical management of breast cancer. "	"Class III myosins (MYO3A and MYO3B) are proposed to function as transporters as well as length and ultrastructure regulators within stable actin-based protrusions such as stereocilia and calycal processes. MYO3A differs from MYO3B in that it contains an extended tail domain with an additional actin-binding motif. We examined how the properties of the motor and tail domains of human class III myosins impact their ability to enhance the formation and elongation of actin protrusions. Direct examination of the motor and enzymatic properties of human MYO3A and MYO3B revealed that MYO3A is a 2-fold faster motor with enhanced ATPase activity and actin affinity. A chimera in which the MYO3A tail was fused to the MYO3B motor demonstrated that motor activity correlates with formation and elongation of actin protrusions. We demonstrate that removal of individual exons (30-34) in the MYO3A tail does not prevent filopodia tip localization but abolishes the ability to enhance actin protrusion formation and elongation in COS7 cells. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that MYO3A slows filopodia dynamics and enhances filopodia lifetime in COS7 cells. We also demonstrate that MYO3A is more efficient than MYO3B at increasing formation and elongation of stable microvilli on the surface of cultured epithelial cells. We propose that the unique features of MYO3A, enhanced motor activity, and an extended tail with tail actin-binding motif, allow it to play an important role in stable actin protrusion length and ultrastructure maintenance."	"Hearing loss is a common sensory impairment. Several genetic loci or genes responsible for non-syndrome hearing loss have been identified, including the well-known deafness genes GJB2, MT-RNR1 and SLC26A4. MYO3A belongs to the myosin superfamily. Previously only three mutations in this gene have been found in an Isreali family with DFNB30, in which patients demonstrated progressive hearing loss.In this study, we characterized a consanguineous Kazakh family with congenital hearing loss. By targeted sequence capture and next-generation sequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation and did bioinformatics analysis to this mutation.A homozygous mutation, MYO3A:c.1841C&gt;T (p.S614F), was identified to be responsible for the disease. Ser614 is located in the motor domain of MYO3A that is highly conserved among different species. Molecular modeling predicts that the conserved Ser614 may play an important role in maintaining the stability of β-sheet and the interaction between neighboring β-strand.This is the second report on MYO3A mutations in deafness and the first report in China. The finding help facilitate establishing a better relationship between MYO3A mutation and hearing phenotypes."	"Retinal dystrophies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders which affect more than two million people worldwide. The present study focused on the role of the ABCA4 gene in the pathogenesis of hereditary retinal dystrophies (autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy, and autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa) in patients of Greek origin.Our cohort included 26 unrelated patients and their first degree healthy relatives. The ABCA4 mutation screening involved Sanger sequencing of all exons and flanking regions. Evaluation of novel variants included sequencing of control samples, family segregation analysis and characterization by in silico prediction tools. Twenty five patients were also screened for copy number variations by array-comparative genomic hybridization.Excluding known disease-causing mutations and polymorphisms, two novel variants were identified in coding and non-coding regions of ABCA4. Array-CGH analysis revealed two partial deletions of USH2A and MYO3A in two patients with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.The ABCA4 mutation spectrum in Greek patients differs from other populations. Bioinformatic tools, segregation analysis along with clinical data from the patients seemed to be crucial for the evaluation of genetic variants and particularly for the discrimination between causative and non-causative variants."	"Hair cells tightly control the dimensions of their stereocilia, which are actin-rich protrusions with graded heights that mediate mechanotransduction in the inner ear. Two members of the myosin-III family, MYO3A and MYO3B, are thought to regulate stereocilia length by transporting cargos that control actin polymerization at stereocilia tips. We show that eliminating espin-1 (ESPN-1), an isoform of ESPN and a myosin-III cargo, dramatically alters the slope of the stereocilia staircase in a subset of hair cells. Furthermore, we show that espin-like (ESPNL), primarily present in developing stereocilia, is also a myosin-III cargo and is essential for normal hearing. ESPN-1 and ESPNL each bind MYO3A and MYO3B, but differentially influence how the two motors function. Consequently, functional properties of different motor-cargo combinations differentially affect molecular transport and the length of actin protrusions. This mechanism is used by hair cells to establish the required range of stereocilia lengths within a single cell. "	"Hereditary hearing loss (HL) is characterized by both allelic and locus genetic heterogeneity. Both recessive and dominant forms of HL may be caused by different mutations in the same deafness gene. In a family with post-lingual progressive non-syndromic deafness, whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA from five hearing-impaired relatives revealed a single variant, p.Gly488Glu (rs145970949:G&gt;A) in MYO3A, co-segregating with HL as an autosomal dominant trait. This amino acid change, predicted to be pathogenic, alters a highly conserved residue in the motor domain of MYO3A. The mutation severely alters the ATPase activity and motility of the protein in vitro, and the mutant protein fails to accumulate in the filopodia tips in COS7 cells. However, the mutant MYO3A was able to reach the tips of organotypic inner ear culture hair cell stereocilia, raising the possibility of a local effect on positioning of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) complex at the stereocilia tips. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction of MYO3A with the cytosolic tail of the integral tip-link protein protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), a core component of MET complex. Interestingly, we uncovered a novel interaction between MYO3A and PCDH15 shedding new light on the function of myosin IIIA at stereocilia tips. "	"Class III myosins (Myo3) and actin-bundling protein Espin play critical roles in regulating the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, and their defects cause hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif (THDI), however it is not clear how Myo3 specifically acts through Espin1 to regulate the actin bundle assembly and stabilization. Here we discover that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 not only elucidate the mechanism of the binding, but also reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. We also provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1. "	"The precise architecture of hair bundles, the arrays of mechanosensitive microvilli-like stereocilia crowning the auditory hair cells, is essential to hearing. Myosin IIIa, defective in the late-onset deafness form DFNB30, has been proposed to transport espin-1 to the tips of stereocilia, thereby promoting their elongation. We show that Myo3a(-/-)Myo3b(-/-) mice lacking myosin IIIa and myosin IIIb are profoundly deaf, whereas Myo3a-cKO Myo3b(-/-) mice lacking myosin IIIb and losing myosin IIIa postnatally have normal hearing. Myo3a(-/-)Myo3b(-/-) cochlear hair bundles display robust mechanoelectrical transduction currents with normal kinetics but show severe embryonic abnormalities whose features rapidly change. These include abnormally tall and numerous microvilli or stereocilia, ungraded stereocilia bundles, and bundle rounding and closure. Surprisingly, espin-1 is properly targeted to Myo3a(-/-)Myo3b(-/-) stereocilia tips. Our results uncover the critical role that class III myosins play redundantly in hair-bundle morphogenesis; they unexpectedly limit the elongation of stereocilia and of subsequently regressing microvilli, thus contributing to the early hair bundle shaping. "	"Cochlear implantation is currently the treatment of choice for children with severe to profound hearing impairment. However, the outcomes with cochlear implants (CIs) vary significantly among recipients. The purpose of the present study is to identify the genetic determinants of poor CI outcomes. Twelve children with poor CI outcomes (the &quot;cases&quot;) and 30 &quot;matched controls&quot; with good CI outcomes were subjected to comprehensive genetic analyses using massively parallel sequencing, which targeted 129 known deafness genes. Audiological features, imaging findings, and auditory/speech performance with CIs were then correlated to the genetic diagnoses. We identified genetic variants which are associated with poor CI outcomes in 7 (58%) of the 12 cases; 4 cases had bi-allelic PCDH15 pathogenic mutations and 3 cases were homozygous for the DFNB59 p.G292R variant. Mutations in the WFS1, GJB3, ESRRB, LRTOMT, MYO3A, and POU3F4 genes were detected in 7 (23%) of the 30 matched controls. The allele frequencies of PCDH15 and DFNB59 variants were significantly higher in the cases than in the matched controls (both P &lt; 0.001). In the 7 CI recipients with PCDH15 or DFNB59 variants, otoacoustic emissions were absent in both ears, and imaging findings were normal in all 7 implanted ears. PCDH15 or DFNB59 variants are associated with poor CI performance, yet children with PCDH15 or DFNB59 variants might show clinical features indistinguishable from those of other typical pediatric CI recipients. Accordingly, genetic examination is indicated in all CI candidates before operation."	"In Drosophila photoreceptors, the NINAC-encoded myosin III is found in a complex with a small, MORN-repeat containing, protein Retinophilin (RTP). Expression of these two proteins in other cell types showed NINAC myosin III behavior is altered by RTP. NINAC deletion constructs were used to map the RTP binding site within the proximal tail domain of NINAC. In vertebrates, the RTP ortholog is MORN4. Co-precipitation experiments demonstrated that human MORN4 binds to human myosin IIIA (MYO3A). In COS7 cells, MORN4 and MYO3A, but not MORN4 and MYO3B, co-localize to actin rich filopodia extensions. Deletion analysis mapped the MORN4 binding to the proximal region of the MYO3A tail domain. MYO3A dependent MORN4 tip localization suggests that MYO3A functions as a motor that transports MORN4 to the filopodia tips and MORN4 may enhance MYO3A tip localization by tethering it to the plasma membrane at the protrusion tips. These results establish conserved features of the RTP/MORN4 family: they bind within the tail domain of myosin IIIs to control their behavior. "	"Understanding the signaling differences that distinguish human HER2-amplified (HER2-positive (HER2+)) breast cancers from other breast cancer subtypes may help to identify protein drug targets for the specific treatment of HER2+ breast cancers. We performed two kinome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens on five HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, seven breast cancer cell lines in which HER2 was not amplified and two normal breast cell lines. To pinpoint the main kinases driving HER2 signaling, we performed a comprehensive siRNA screen that identified loss of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer as having the most prominent inhibitory effect on the growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells. In a second siRNA screen focused on identifying genes that could sensitize HER2+ cells to trastuzumab treatment, we found that loss of signaling members downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab. Loss of HER2 and HER3, as well as proteins involved in mitogenic and environmental stress pathways inhibited the proliferation of HER2+ cells only in the absence of trastuzumab, suggesting that these pathways are inhibited by trastuzumab treatment. Loss of essential G2/M cell cycle mediators or proteins involved in vesicle organization exerted inhibitory effects on HER2+ cell growth that were unaffected by trastuzumab. Furthermore, the use of a sensitization index (SI) identified targeting the PI3K pathway to sensitize to trastuzumab treatment. Antagonism using the SI identified MYO3A, MYO3B and MPZL1 as antagonizers to trastuzumab treatment among HER2+ cell lines. Our results suggest that the dimerization partners of HER2 are important for determining the activation of downstream proliferation pathways. Understanding the complex layers of signaling triggered downstream of HER2 homodimers and heterodimers will facilitate the selection of better targets for combination therapies intended to treat HER2+ breast cancers. "
"OTOA"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents in 5% of all cancers, including the majority of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. Downregulation of innate immune genes (IIGs) by HPV to promote the viral life cycle is well documented; E6 and E7 are known repressors of these genes. More recently, we demonstrated that E2 could also repress IIGs. These studies have been carried out in cells overexpressing the viral proteins, and to further investigate the role of individual viral proteins in this repression, we introduced stop codons into E6 and/or E7 in the entire HPV16 genome and generated N/Tert-1 cells stably maintaining the HPV16 genomes. We demonstrate that E6 or E7 individually is not sufficient to repress IIG expression in the context of the entire HPV16 genome; both are required for a synergistic repression. The DNA damage response (DDR) is activated by HPV16 irrespective of E6 and E7 expression, presumably due to viral replication; E1 is a known activator of the DDR. In addition, replication stress was apparent in HPV16-positive cells lacking E6 and E7, manifested by attenuated cellular growth and activation of replication stress genes. These studies led us to the following model. Viral replication <i>per se</i> can activate the DDR following infection, and this activation is a known inducer of IIG expression, which may induce cellular senescence. To combat this, E6 and E7 synergistically combine to manipulate the DDR and actively repress innate immune gene expression promoting cellular growth; neither protein by itself is able to do this.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The role of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) in human cancers is well established; however, to date there are no antiviral therapeutics that are available for combatting these cancers. To identify such targets, we must enhance the understanding of the viral life cycle. Innate immune genes (IIGs) are repressed by HPV16, and we have reported that this repression persists through to cancer. Reversal of this repression would boost the immune response to HPV16-positive tumors, an area that is becoming more important given the advances in immunotherapy. This report demonstrates that E6 and E7 synergistically repress IIG expression in the context of the entire HPV16 genome. Removal of either protein activates the expression of IIGs by HPV16. Therefore, gaining a precise understanding of how the viral oncogenes repress IIG expression represents an opportunity to reverse this repression and boost the immune response to HPV16 infections for therapeutic gain."	"The <i>OTOA</i> gene (Locus: DFNB22) is reported to be one of the causative genes for non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss. The copy number variations (CNVs) identified in this gene are also known to cause hearing loss, but have not been identified in Japanese patients with hearing loss. Furthermore, the clinical features of <i>OTOA</i>-associated hearing loss have not yet been clarified. In this study, we performed CNV analyses of a large Japanese hearing loss cohort, and identified CNVs in 234 of 2262 (10.3%, 234/2262) patients with autosomal recessive hearing loss. Among the identified CNVs, <i>OTOA</i> gene-related CNVs were the second most frequent (0.6%, 14/2262). Among the 14 cases, 2 individuals carried <i>OTOA</i> homozygous deletions, 4 carried heterozygous deletions with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in another allele. Additionally, 1 individual with homozygous SNVs in the <i>OTOA</i> gene was also identified. Finally, we identified 7 probands with OTOA-associated hearing loss, so that its prevalence in Japanese patients with autosomal recessive hearing loss was calculated to be 0.3% (7/2262). As novel clinical features identified in this study, the audiometric configurations of patients with <i>OTOA</i>-associated hearing loss were found to be mid-frequency. This is the first study focused on the detailed clinical features of hearing loss caused by this gene mutation and/or gene deletion."	"Human papillomaviruses induce a host of anogenital cancers, as well as oropharyngeal cancer (HPV+OPC); human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is causative in around 90% of HPV+OPC cases. Using telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) immortalized foreskin keratinocytes (N/Tert-1), we have identified significant host gene reprogramming by HPV16 (N/Tert-1+HPV16) and demonstrated that N/Tert-1+HPV16 support late stages of the viral life cycle. Expression of the cellular dNTPase and homologous recombination factor sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartic domain HD-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is transcriptionally regulated by HPV16 in N/Tert-1. CRISPR/Cas9 removal of SAMHD1 from N/Tert-1 and N/Tert-1+HPV16 demonstrates that SAMHD1 controls cell proliferation of N/Tert-1 only in the presence of HPV16; the deletion of SAMHD1 promotes hyperproliferation of N/Tert-1+HPV16 cells in organotypic raft cultures but has no effect on N/Tert-1. Viral replication is also elevated in the absence of SAMHD1. This new system has allowed us to identify a specific interaction between SAMHD1 and HPV16 that regulates host cell proliferation and viral replication; such studies are problematic in nonimmortalized primary keratinocytes due to their limited life span. To confirm the relevance of our results, we repeated the analysis with human tonsil keratinocytes (HTK) immortalized by HPV16 (HTK+HPV16) and observed the same hyperproliferative phenotype following CRISPR/Cas9 editing of SAMHD1. Identical results were obtained with three independent CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNAs. The isogenic pairing of N/Tert-1 with N/Tert-1+HPV16, combined with HTK+HPV16, presents a unique system to identify host genes whose products functionally interact with HPV16 to regulate host cellular growth in keratinocytes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> HPVs are causative agents in human cancers and are responsible for around of 5% of all cancers. A better understanding of the viral life cycle in keratinocytes will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to combat HPV-positive cancers. Here, we present a unique keratinocyte model to identify host proteins that specifically interact with HPV16. Using this system, we report that a cellular gene, SAMHD1, is regulated by HPV16 at the RNA and protein levels in keratinocytes. Elimination of SAMHD1 from these cells using CRISPR/Cas9 editing promotes enhanced cellular proliferation by HPV16 in keratinocytes and elevated viral replication but not in keratinocytes that do not have HPV16. Our study demonstrates a specific intricate interplay between HPV16 and SAMHD1 during the viral life cycle and establishes a unique model system to assist exploring host factors critical for HPV pathogenesis."	"The 16p12.2 chromosome band contains three large segmental duplications: BP1, BP2 and BP3, providing a substrate for recombination and recurrent chromosomal rearrangements. The '16p12.2 microdeletion' is a recurrent deletion comprised between BP2 and BP3, associated with variable clinical findings. We identified a heterozygous 16p12.2 microdeletion spanning between BP1 and BP2 in a child evaluated for short stature and mild dyslexia. Unexpectedly, the mother carried the same deletion in the homozygous state and suffered from severe hearing loss. Detailed family history revealed consanguinity of the maternal grandparents. The 16p12.2 microdeletion is a rare condition and contains only three genes: <i>METTL9</i>, <i>IGSF6</i> and <i>OTOA</i> of which the <i>OTOA</i> is considered responsible for DFNB22 hearing loss (MIM: 607039) under its homozygous condition. A number of OTOA mutations have been described, whereas very few cases of a 16p12.2 microdeletion similar to that observed in our family have been reported. In conclusion, we describe a rare 'distal 16p12.2microdeletion' widening the phenotypic spectrum associated with the recurrent 16p12.2 microdeletion and support the causative role of <i>OTOA</i> microdeletion in hearing impairment."	"Exomes of 27 Russian subjects were analyzed for the presence of medically relevant alleles, such as protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in known recessive disease-associated genes and pathogenic missense mutations included in the ClinVar database. 36 variants (24 PTVs and 12 amino acid substitutions) were identified and then subjected to the analysis in 897 population controls. 9/36 mutations were novel, however only two of them (POLH c.490delG associated with xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) and CATSPER1 c.859_860delCA responsible for spermatogenic failure) were shown to be recurrent. 27 out of 36 pathogenic alleles were already described in prior genetic studies; seven of them occurred only in the index cases, while 20 demonstrated evidence for persistence in Russian population. In particular, non-random occurrence was revealed for SERPINA1 c.1096G &gt; A (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), C8B c.1282C &gt; T and c.1653G &gt; A (complement component 8B deficiency), ATP7B c.3207C &gt; A (Wilson disease), PROP1 c.301_302delAG (combined pituitary hormone deficiency), CYP21A2 c.844G &gt; T (non-classical form of adrenogenital syndrome), EYS c.1155T &gt; A (retinitis pigmentosa), HADHA c.1528G &gt; C (LCHAD deficiency), SCO2 c.418G &gt; A (cytochrome c oxidase deficiency), OTOA c.2359G &gt; T (sensorineural deafness), C2 c.839_866del (complement component 2 deficiency), ACADVL c.848T &gt; C (VLCAD deficiency), TGM5 c.337G &gt; T (acral peeling skin syndrome) and VWF c.2561 G &gt; A (von Willebrand disease, type 2N). These data deserve to be considered in future medical genetic activities."	"Otoancorin (OTOA), encoded by OTOA, is required for the development of the tectorial membrane in the inner ear. Mutations in this gene cause nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB22). The molecular mechanisms underlying most DFNB22 remain poorly understood. Disruption of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchorage has been assumed to be the pathophysiology mandating experimental validation. From a Korean deaf family, we identified two trans OTOA variants (c.1320 + 5 G &gt; C and p.Gln589ArgfsX55 [NM_144672.3]) . The pathogenic potential of c.1320 + 5 G &gt; C was confirmed by a minigene splicing assay. To experimentally determine the GPI anchorage, wild-type (WT) and mutant OTOA harboring p.Gln589ArgfsX55 were expressed in HEK293T cells. The mutant OTOA with p.Gln589ArgfsX55 resulted in an uncontrolled release of OTOA into the medium in contrast with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-induced controlled release of WT OTOA from the cell surface. Together, the results of this reverse translational study confirmed GPI-anchorage of OTOA and showed that downstream sequences from the 589th amino acid are critical for GPI-anchorage."	"BACKGROUND RUNXl plays a key regulatory role in the process of hematopoiesis and is a common target for multiple chromosomal translocations in human acute leukemia. Mutations of RUNX1 gene can lead to acute leukemia and affect the prognosis of AML patients. We aimed to identify pivotal genes and pathways involved in RUNX1-mutated patients of with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to explore possible molecular markers for novel therapeutic targets of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS The RNA sequencing datasets of 151 cases of AML were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using edgeR of the R platform. PPI (protein-protein interaction) network clustering modules were analyzed with ClusterONE, and the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analyses for modules were performed. RESULTS A total of 379 genes were identified as DEGs. The KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs showed significantly enriched pathways in cancer, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction pathway, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. The top 10 genes ranked by degree were PRKACG, ANKRD7, RNFL7, ROPN11, TEX14, PRMT8, OTOA, CFAP99, NRXN1, and DMRT1, which were identified as hub genes from the protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Statistical analysis revealed that RUNX1-mutated patients with AML had a shorter median survival time (MST) with poor clinical outcome and an increased risk of death when compared with those without RUNX1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS DEGs and pathways identified in the present study will help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying RUNX1 mutations in AML and develop effective therapeutic strategies for RUNX1-mutation AML."	"Comprehensive genetic testing has become integral in the evaluation of children with deafness, but the amount of blood required to obtain DNA can be prohibitive in newborns. Dried blood spots (DBSs) are routinely collected and would provide an alternative source of DNA. Our objective was to evaluate the use of DBSs for comprehensive genetic testing for deafness. DNA derived from fresh and archived DBS samples was compared with DNA from whole blood. We performed next-generation sequencing of all known deafness genes in 4 DBS samples: 2 positive controls, an unknown sample, and a negative control. The DBS-derived DNA was of sufficient quantity and quality for clinical testing. In the 2 positive control samples, pathogenic variants were identified; in the negative control, no pathogenic variants were found; and in the unknown sample, homozygous deletion of the OTOA gene was identified as the cause of deafness. This pilot study shows that comprehensive genetic testing for deafness is feasible with fresh and/or archived DBSs."	"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis in infants. Maternal immunization is an option to increase maternal antibody levels and protect infants from infection. Here we assess the efficacy of virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates containing stabilized pre-fusion (pre-F) or post-fusion (post-F) conformations of the RSV F protein and the attachment RSV G protein in a maternal immunization model using cotton rats. VLP vaccines containing RSV F and G proteins strongly boost pre-existing RSV immunity in dams preventing their perinatal drop in immunity. Boosting is stronger for the pre-F VLP than for the post-F VLP or purified subunit F protein vaccines, giving an advantage on mothers' protection. VLP immunization of dams provides significant protection to pups from RSV challenge and reduced pulmonary inflammation. Collectively, our results show that a VLP vaccine with RSV F and G proteins is safe and effective for maternal and adult vaccination."	"The interpretation of the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) results can be challenging for variants identified in the sporadic deaf patients. In this study, we performed targeted NGS of 143 deafness-associated genes in 44 sporadic deaf patients and use parental genotyping to test whether the candidate pathogenic variants complied with recessive or de novo pattern. Of 29 recessive candidate variants with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) less than 0.005, 3 pairs of apparent compound heterozygous variants were inherited from the same parental allele, ruling out their pathogenic roles. In addition, non-segregation of an OTOA p.Gln293Arg variant led to the discovery of a genomic microdeletion of OTOA on the opposite allele by copy number variation analysis. Overall, 13 pairs of recessive candidate variants were deemed causative in 13 patients. Of the 28 dominant candidate variants with MAFs less than 0.0005, none occurred de novo, suggesting that they were not disease causing. Our results revealed that targeted NGS in sporadic deaf patients may generate a significant false-positive rate. Parental genotyping is a simple but effective step toward minimizing the false-positive results. Our study also showed that de novo variants in dominant deafness genes may not be a common cause for sporadic deafness."	"Combined retinal degeneration and sensorineural hearing impairment is mostly due to autosomal recessive Usher syndrome (USH1: congenital deafness, early retinitis pigmentosa (RP); USH2: progressive hearing impairment, RP).Sanger sequencing and NGS of 112 genes (Usher syndrome, nonsyndromic deafness, overlapping conditions), MLPA, and array-CGH were conducted in 138 patients clinically diagnosed with Usher syndrome.A molecular diagnosis was achieved in 97% of both USH1 and USH2 patients, with biallelic mutations in 97% (USH1) and 90% (USH2), respectively. Quantitative readout reliably detected CNVs (confirmed by MLPA or array-CGH), qualifying targeted NGS as one tool for detecting point mutations and CNVs. CNVs accounted for 10% of identified <i>USH2A</i> alleles, often <i>in trans</i> to seemingly monoallelic point mutations. We demonstrate PTC124-induced read-through of the common p.Trp3955* nonsense mutation (13% of detected <i>USH2A</i> alleles), a potential therapy target. Usher gene mutations were found in most patients with atypical Usher syndrome, but the diagnosis was adjusted in case of double homozygosity for mutations in <i>OTOA</i> and <i>NR2E3</i>, genes implicated in isolated deafness and RP. Two patients with additional enamel dysplasia had biallelic <i>PEX26</i> mutations, for the first time linking this gene to Heimler syndrome.Targeted NGS not restricted to Usher genes proved beneficial in uncovering conditions mimicking Usher syndrome."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Maternal immunization directed to control RSV infection in newborns and infants is an appealing vaccination strategy currently under development. In this work we have modeled maternal vaccination against RSV in cotton rats (CR) to answer two fundamental questions on maternal vaccine safety. We tested (i), whether a known, unsafe RSV vaccine (i.e., FI-RSV Lot 100 vaccine) induces vaccine enhanced disease in the presence of passively transferred, RSV maternal immunity, and (ii) whether the same FI-RSV vaccine could induce vaccine enhanced disease in CR litters when used to immunize their RSV-primed mothers. Our data show that FI-RSV immunization of pups with subsequent RSV infection results in vaccine-enhanced disease independent of whether the pups were born to RSV-seropositive or RSV-seronegative mothers, and that FI-RSV immunization of RSV-seropositive mothers does not present a health risk to either the mother or the infant. Our study also raises a novel concern regarding infant immunization, namely that &quot;safe&quot; RSV vaccines (e.g., live RSV administered intramuscularly) may induce vaccine-enhanced disease in RSV-infected pups born to seropositive mothers. Finally, we describe for the first time a sharp decrease in RSV neutralizing antibody titers in immunized seropositive CR at the time of delivery. This decline may reflect maternal immune suppression, potentially pinpointing a window of increased vulnerability to RSV infection that could be alleviated by effective immunization of expectant mothers."	"Hereditary hearing loss is characterized by a very high genetic heterogeneity. In the Qatari population the role of GJB2, the worldwide HHL major player, seems to be quite limited compared to Caucasian populations. In this study we analysed 18 Qatari families affected by non-syndromic hearing loss using a targeted sequencing approach that allowed us to analyse 81 genes simultaneously. Thanks to this approach, 50% of these families (9 out of 18) resulted positive for the presence of likely causative alleles in 6 different genes: CDH23, MYO6, GJB6, OTOF, TMC1 and OTOA. In particular, 4 novel alleles were detected while the remaining ones were already described to be associated to HHL in other ethnic groups. Molecular modelling has been used to further investigate the role of novel alleles identified in CDH23 and TMC1 genes demonstrating their crucial role in Ca2+ binding and therefore possible functional role in proteins. Present study showed that an accurate molecular diagnosis based on next generation sequencing technologies might largely improve molecular diagnostics outcome leading to benefits for both genetic counseling and definition of recurrence risk."	"Hearing impairment (HI) is genetically heterogeneous which hampers genetic counseling and molecular diagnosis. Testing of several single HI-related genes is laborious and expensive. In this study, we evaluate the diagnostic utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) targeting a panel of HI-related genes. Two hundred index patients, mostly of Dutch origin, with presumed hereditary HI underwent WES followed by targeted analysis of an HI gene panel of 120 genes. We found causative variants underlying the HI in 67 of 200 patients (33.5%). Eight of these patients have a large homozygous deletion involving STRC, OTOA or USH2A, which could only be identified by copy number variation detection. Variants of uncertain significance were found in 10 patients (5.0%). In the remaining 123 cases, no potentially causative variants were detected (61.5%). In our patient cohort, causative variants in GJB2, USH2A, MYO15A and STRC, and in MYO6 were the leading causes for autosomal recessive and dominant HI, respectively. Segregation analysis and functional analyses of variants of uncertain significance will probably further increase the diagnostic yield of WES."	"Although there are nearly 100 different causative genes identified for nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), Sanger sequencing-based DNA diagnostics usually only analyses three, namely, GJB2, SLC26A4, and OTOF. As this is seen as inadequate, there is a need for high-throughput diagnostic methods to detect disease-causing variations, including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (Indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). In this study, a targeted resequencing panel for hearing loss was developed including 79 genes for NSHL and selected forms of syndromic hearing loss. One-hundred thirty one presumed autosomal-recessive NSHL (arNSHL) patients of Western-European ethnicity were analyzed for SNVs, Indels, and CNVs. In addition, we established a straightforward variant classification system to deal with the large number of variants encountered. We estimate that combining prescreening of GJB2 with our panel leads to a diagnosis in 25%-30% of patients. Our data show that after GJB2, the most commonly mutated genes in a Western-European population are TMC1, MYO15A, and MYO7A (3.1%). CNV analysis resulted in the identification of causative variants in two patients in OTOA and STRC. One of the major challenges for diagnostic gene panels is assigning pathogenicity for variants. A collaborative database collecting all identified variants from multiple centers could be a valuable resource for hearing loss diagnostics."	"Mutations in genes encoding tectorial membrane (TM) proteins are a significant cause of human hereditary hearing loss (Hildebrand et al. 2011), and several mouse models have been developed to study the functional significance of this accessory structure in the mammalian cochlea. In this study, we use otoacoustic emissions (OAE), signals obtained from the ear canal that provide a measure of cochlear function, to characterize a mouse in which the TM is detached from the spiral limbus due to an absence of otoancorin (Otoa, Lukashkin et al. 2012). Our results demonstrate that spontaneous emissions (SOAE), sounds produced in the cochlea without stimulation, increase dramatically in mice with detached TMs even though their hearing sensitivity is reduced. This behavior is unusual because wild-type (WT) controls are rarely spontaneous emitters. SOAEs in mice lacking Otoa predominate around 7 kHz, which is much lower than in either WT animals when they generate SOAEs or in mutant mice in which the TM protein Ceacam16 is absent (Cheatham et al. 2014). Although both mutants lack Hensen's stripe, loss of this TM feature is only observed in regions coding frequencies greater than ~15 kHz in WT mice so its loss cannot explain the low-frequency, de novo SOAEs observed in mice lacking Otoa. The fact that ~80 % of mice lacking Otoa produce SOAEs even when they generate smaller distortion product OAEs suggests that the active process is still functioning in these mutants but the system(s) involved have become less stable due to alterations in TM structure. "	"The genetic heterogeneity of congenital hearing disorders makes molecular diagnosis expensive and time-consuming using conventional techniques such as Sanger sequencing of DNA. In order to design an appropriate strategy of molecular diagnosis in the Algerian population, we explored the diversity of the involved mutations by studying 65 families affected by autosomal recessive forms of nonsyndromic hearing impairment (DFNB forms), which are the most prevalent early onset forms. We first carried out a systematic screening for mutations in GJB2 and the recurrent p.(Arg34*) mutation in TMC1, which were found in 31 (47.7%) families and 1 (1.5%) family, respectively. We then performed whole exome sequencing in nine of the remaining families, and identified the causative mutations in all the patients analyzed, either in the homozygous state (eight families) or in the compound heterozygous state (one family): (c.709C&gt;T: p.(Arg237*)) and (c.2122C&gt;T: p.(Arg708*)) in OTOF, (c.1334T&gt;G: p.(Leu445Trp)) in SLC26A4, (c.764T&gt;A: p.(Met255Lys)) in GIPC3, (c.518T&gt;A: p.(Cys173Ser)) in LHFPL5, (c.5336T&gt;C: p.(Leu1779Pro)) in MYO15A, (c.1807G&gt;T: p.(Val603Phe)) in OTOA, (c.6080dup: p.(Asn2027Lys*9)) in PTPRQ, and (c.6017del: p.(Gly2006Alafs*13); c.7188_7189ins14: p.(Val2397Leufs*2)) in GPR98. Notably, 7 of these 10 mutations affecting 8 different genes had not been reported previously. These results highlight for the first time the genetic heterogeneity of the early onset forms of nonsyndromic deafness in Algerian families. "	"The tectorial membrane (TM) of the mammalian cochlea is a complex extracellular matrix which, in response to acoustic stimulation, displaces the hair bundles of outer hair cells (OHCs), thereby initiating sensory transduction and amplification. Here, using TM segments from the basal, high-frequency region of the cochleae of genetically modified mice (including models of human hereditary deafness) with missing or modified TM proteins, we demonstrate that frequency-dependent stiffening is associated with the striated sheet matrix (SSM). Frequency-dependent stiffening largely disappeared in all three TM mutations studied where the SSM was absent either entirely or at least from the stiffest part of the TM overlying the OHCs. In all three TM mutations, dissipation of energy is decreased at low (&lt;8 kHz) and increased at high (&gt;8 kHz) stimulus frequencies. The SSM is composed of polypeptides carrying fixed charges, and electrostatic interaction between them may account for frequency-dependent stiffness changes in the material properties of the TM. Through comparison with previous in vivo measurements, it is proposed that implementation of frequency-dependent stiffening of the TM in the OHC attachment region facilitates interaction among tones, backward transmission of energy, and amplification in the cochlea. "	"The genetic diversity of loci and mutations underlying hereditary hearing loss is an active area of investigation. To identify loci associated with predominantly non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, we performed exome sequencing of families and of single probands, as well as copy number variation (CNV) mapping in a case-control cohort.Analysis of three distinct families revealed several candidate loci in two families and a single strong candidate gene, MYH7B, for hearing loss in one family. MYH7B encodes a Type II myosin, consistent with a role for cytoskeletal proteins in hearing. High-resolution genome-wide CNV analysis of 150 cases and 157 controls revealed deletions in genes known to be involved in hearing (e.g. GJB6, OTOA, and STRC, encoding connexin 30, otoancorin, and stereocilin, respectively), supporting CNV contributions to hearing loss phenotypes. Additionally, a novel region on chromosome 16 containing part of the PDXDC1 gene was found to be frequently deleted in hearing loss patients (OR=3.91, 95% CI: 1.62-9.40, p=1.45×10(-7)).We conclude that many known as well as novel loci and distinct types of mutations not typically tested in clinical settings can contribute to the etiology of hearing loss. Our study also demonstrates the challenges of exome sequencing and genome-wide CNV mapping for direct clinical application, and illustrates the need for functional and clinical follow-up as well as curated open-access databases."
"OTOG"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Meniere's disease (MD) is a rare inner ear disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, episodic vertigo, and tinnitus. Familial MD has been reported in 6 to 9% of sporadic cases, and few genes including FAM136A, DTNA, PRKCB, SEMA3D, and DPT have been involved in single families, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. In this study, the authors recruited 46 families with MD to search for relevant candidate genes for hearing loss in familial MD.Exome sequencing data from MD patients were analyzed to search for rare variants in hearing loss genes in a case-control study. A total of 109 patients with MD (73 familial cases and 36 early-onset sporadic patients) diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria defined by the Barany Society were recruited in 11 hospitals. The allelic frequencies of rare variants in hearing loss genes were calculated in individuals with familial MD. A single rare variant analysis and a gene burden analysis (GBA) were conducted in the dataset selecting 1 patient from each family. Allelic frequencies from European and Spanish reference datasets were used as controls.A total of 5136 single-nucleotide variants in hearing loss genes were considered for single rare variant analysis in familial MD cases, but only 1 heterozygous likely pathogenic variant in the OTOG gene (rs552304627) was found in 2 unrelated families. The gene burden analysis found an enrichment of rare missense variants in the OTOG gene in familial MD. So, 15 of 46 families (33%) showed at least 1 rare missense variant in the OTOG gene, suggesting a key role in familial MD.The authors found an enrichment of multiplex rare missense variants in the OTOG gene in familial MD. This finding supports OTOG as a relevant gene in familial MD and set the groundwork for genetic testing in MD."	"Neurodevelopmental disorders are a challenge in medical genetics due to genetic heterogeneity and complex genotype-phenotype correlations. For this reason, the resolution of single cases not belonging to well-defined syndromes often requires an integrated approach of multiple whole-genome technologies. Such an approach has also unexpectedly revealed a complex molecular basis in an increasing number of patients, for whom the original suspect of a pleiotropic syndrome has been resolved as the summation effect of multiple genes. We describe a 10-year-old boy, the third son of first-cousin parents, with global developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, and bilateral deafness. SNP-array analysis revealed regions of homozygosity (ROHs) in multiple chromosome regions. Whole-exome sequencing prioritized on gene-mapping into the ROHs showed homozygosity for the likely pathogenic c.1097_1098delAG p. (Arg366Thrfs*2) frameshift substitution in <i>LARP7</i> and the likely pathogenic c.5743C&gt;T p.(Arg1915*) nonsense variant in <i>OTOG</i>. Recessive variants in <i>LARP7</i> cause Alazami syndrome, while variants in <i>OTOG</i> cause an extremely rare autosomal recessive form of neurosensorial deafness. Previously unreported features were acrocyanosis and palmoplantar hyperhidrosis. This case highlights the utility of encouraging technological updates in medical genetics laboratories involved in the study of neurodevelopmental disorders and integrating laboratory outputs with the competencies of next-generation clinicians."	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. In this study, we characterized the clinical features of 12 Chinese Han deaf families in which mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1 were excluded.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 147 known deafness genes was performed in probands of 10 families, while whole-exome sequencing was applied in those of the rest two.Pathogenic mutations in a total of 11 rare deafness genes, OTOF, CDH23, PCDH15, PDZD7, ADGRV1, KARS, OTOG, GRXCR2, MYO6, GRHL2, and POU3F4, were identified in all 12 probands, with 16 mutations being novel. Intrafamilial cosegregation of the mutations and the deafness phenotype were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Our results expanded the mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation of nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese Hans and also emphasized the importance of combining both next-generation sequencing and detailed auditory evaluation to achieve a more accurate diagnosis for nonsyndromic hearing loss."	"Natural grasslands provide important land resources in pastoral areas, and greatly contribute to ecological functioning. Overgrazing and other unreasonable exploitations have led to the degradation and desertification of natural grasslands, exacerbating the forage-livestock imbalance. In areas suffering from water shortage, this imbalance gradually evolves into a water-land forage-livestock imbalance. In this study, a water-land forage-livestock balance-based model was developed to optimise the allocation of water, land, and forage resources in pastoral areas, while addressing economic and ecological benefits in a coupled manner. The model was applied in a case study of Otog Front Banner to simulate the comprehensive economic and ecological benefits to the development of water, land, and forage resources in different coupled allocations of artificial and natural grasslands. The results showed that as the duration of supplementary and barn feeding increased, local development was first constrained by the availability of natural grasslands and then by the availability of water resources. The optimal resource allocation in Otog Front Banner predicted for 2030 included a water consumption of 266,000,000 m<sup>3</sup>, an irrigation area of 43,000 ha, a natural grassland utilisation area of 684,700 ha, and a livestock farming scale of 1,188,500 sheep units."	"Meniere's disease (MD) is a complex disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo attacks, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), tinnitus and aural fullness. MD has been attributed to an accumulation of endolymph in the cochlear duct. The diagnosis of MD is based on the phenomenological association of clinical symptoms and the demonstration of SNHL during the vertigo attacks. Several evidences support a genetic contribution to MD including differences in the prevalence according to the ethnic background and familial aggregation in European and Asian populations in multiplex families with autosomal dominant inheritance. The genetic underpinnings of MD may include some rare monogenic forms in isolated families and a polygenic contribution in most familial and sporadic cases. So, familial MD has been reported in 6-8% of sporadic cases and several genes have been described in single Familial MD including FAM136A, DTNA, PRKCB, SEMA3D and DPT, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Multiplex rare missense variants in OTOG gene have been reported in 33% of familial MD, suggesting multiallelic inheritance. Moreover, the genetic landscape of sporadic MD is more complex and it involves multiplex rare variants in several SNHL genes such as GJB2, USH1G, SLC26A4, ESRRB, and CLDN14 and axonal-guidance signalling genes such as NTN4 and NOX3. This review summarizes evidence to support a genetic contribution in MD and the start of deciphering the genetic architecture to design and develop a molecular map of MD."	"The function of outer hair cells (OHCs), the mechanical actuators of the cochlea, involves the anchoring of their tallest stereocilia in the tectorial membrane (TM), an acellular structure overlying the sensory epithelium. Otogelin and otogelin-like are TM proteins related to secreted epithelial mucins. Defects in either cause the DFNB18B and DFNB84B genetic forms of deafness, respectively, both characterized by congenital mild-to-moderate hearing impairment. We show here that mutant mice lacking otogelin or otogelin-like have a marked OHC dysfunction, with almost no acoustic distortion products despite the persistence of some mechanoelectrical transduction. In both mutants, these cells lack the horizontal top connectors, which are fibrous links joining adjacent stereocilia, and the TM-attachment crowns coupling the tallest stereocilia to the TM. These defects are consistent with the previously unrecognized presence of otogelin and otogelin-like in the OHC hair bundle. The defective hair bundle cohesiveness and the absence of stereociliary imprints in the TM observed in these mice have also been observed in mutant mice lacking stereocilin, a model of the DFNB16 genetic form of deafness, also characterized by congenital mild-to-moderate hearing impairment. We show that the localizations of stereocilin, otogelin, and otogelin-like in the hair bundle are interdependent, indicating that these proteins interact to form the horizontal top connectors and the TM-attachment crowns. We therefore suggest that these 2 OHC-specific structures have shared mechanical properties mediating reaction forces to sound-induced shearing motion and contributing to the coordinated displacement of stereocilia."	"We describe the clinical features of four Japanese families with moderate sensorineural hearing loss due to the <i>OTOG</i> gene variant. We analyzed 98 hearing loss-related genes in patients with hearing loss originally from the Okinawa Islands using next-generation sequencing. We identified a homozygous variant of the gene encoding otogelin NM_001277269(OTOG): c.330C&gt;G, p.Tyr110* in four families. All patients had moderate hearing loss with a slightly downsloping audiogram, including low frequency hearing loss without equilibrium dysfunction. Progressive hearing loss was not observed over the long-term in any patient. Among the three patients who underwent newborn hearing screening, two patients passed the test. <i>OTOG</i>-associated hearing loss was considered to progress early after birth, leading to moderate hearing loss and the later stable phase of hearing loss. Therefore, there are patients whose hearing loss cannot be detected by NHS, making genetic diagnosis of <i>OTOG</i> variants highly useful for complementing NHS in the clinical setting. Based on the allele frequency results, hearing loss caused by the p.Tyr110* variant in <i>OTOG</i> might be more common than we identified. The p.Tyr110* variant was reported in South Korea, suggesting that this variant is a common cause of moderate hearing loss in Japanese and Korean populations."	"The first catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanation of diazo oxime ethers with olefins was developed. In the presence of a Ru(II)-Pheox catalyst, various optically active cyclopropyl oxime derivatives were obtained in high yields (up to 99%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). Furthermore, optically active cyclopropyl oxime ethers could be successfully converted into the corresponding cyclopropyl methylamine derivatives via metal hydride and Grignard reagent mediated Beckmann rearrangement, which are potential candidates for the assessment of biological and pharmaceutical activities."	"The aim of this study was to screen for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to construct genetic risk prediction models for NIHL in a Chinese population.Four hundred seventy-six subjects with NIHL and 476 matched controls were recruited from a cross-sectional survey on NIHL in China. A total of 83 candidate SNPs were genotyped using nanofluidic dynamic arrays on a Fluidigm platform. NIHL-associated SNPs were screened with a multiple logistic model, and a genetic risk model was constructed based on the genetic risk score (GRS). The results were validated using a prospective cohort population.Seven SNPs in the CDH23, PCDH15, EYA4, MYO1A, KCNMA1, and OTOG genes were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with the risk of NIHL, whereas seven other SNPs were marginally (P &gt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.1) associated with the risk of NIHL. A positive correlation was observed between GRS values and odds ratio (OR) for NIHL. Two SNPs, namely, rs212769 and rs7910544, were validated in the cohort study. Subjects with higher GRS (≧9) showed a higher risk of NIHL incidence with an OR of 2.00 (95% CI = 1.04, 3.86).Genetic susceptibility plays an important role in the incidence of NIHL. GRS values, which are based on NIHL-associated SNPs. GRS may be utilized in the evaluation of genetic risk for NIHL and in the determination of NIHL susceptibility."	"Blood components are considered to reflect nutrient metabolism and immune activity in both humans and animals. In this study, we measured 12 blood components in Pekin ducks and performed genome-wide association analysis to identify the QTLs (quantitative trait locus) using a genotyping-by-sequencing strategy. A total of 54 QTLs were identified for blood components. One genome-wide significant QTL for alkaline phosphatase was identified within the intron-region of the OTOG gene (P = 1.31E-07). Moreover, 21 genome-wide significant SNPs for the level of serum cholinesterase were identified on six different scaffolds. In addition, for serum calcium, one genome-wide significant QTL was identified in the upstream region of gene RAB11B. These results provide new markers for functional studies in Pekin ducks, and several candidate genes were identified, which may provide additional insights into specific mechanisms for blood metabolism in ducks and their potential application for duck breeding programs."	"A reusable and highly enantioselective catalyst for the intramolecular cyclopropanation of various diazo ester and Weinreb amide derivatives was developed. The reactions catalyzed by a water-soluble Ru(II)-<i>Amm</i>-Pheox catalyst proceeded smoothly at room temperature, affording the corresponding bicyclic cyclopropane ring-fused lactones and lactams in high yields (up to 99%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). After screening of various catalysts, the Ru(II)-<i>Amm</i>-Pheox complex having an ammonium group proved to be crucial for the intramolecular cyclopropanation reaction in a water/ether biphasic medium. The water-soluble catalyst could be reused at least six times with little loss in yield and enantioselectivity."	"For multiple generations, much of the Arab population of Northern Israel has lived in communities with consanguineous marriages and large families. These communities have been particularly cooperative and informative for understanding the genetics of recessive traits. We studied the genetics of hearing loss in this population, evaluating 168 families from 46 different villages. All families were screened for founder variants by Sanger sequencing and 13 families were further evaluated by sequencing all known genes for hearing loss using our targeted gene panel HEar-Seq. Deafness in 34 of 168 families (20%) was explained by founder variants in GJB2, SLC26A4, or OTOF. In 6 of 13 families (46%) evaluated using HEar-Seq, deafness was explained by damaging alleles of SLC26A4, MYO15A, OTOG, LOXHD1, and TBC1D24. In some genes critical to hearing, it is particularly difficult to interpret variants that might affect splicing, because the genes are not expressed in accessible tissue. To address this problem for possible splice-altering variants of MYO15A, we evaluated minigenes transfected into HEK293 cells. Results revealed exon skipping in the message of MYO15A c.9083+6T&gt;A, and intron retention in the message of MYO15A c.8340G&gt;A, in each case leading to a premature stop and consistent with co-segregation of homozygosity for each variant with hearing loss. The profile of genetics of hearing loss in this population reflects the genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss and the usefulness of synthetic technologies to evaluate potentially causal variants in genes not expressed in accessible tissues."	"Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma with a poor prognosis: the 5-year survival rate is approximately 30%. Somatic driver mutations have been found in TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, RHOA, FYN, PLCG1, and CD28, whereas germline susceptibility to AITL has to our knowledge not been studied. The homogenous Finnish population is well suited for studies on genetic predisposition. Here, we performed an exome-wide rare variant analysis in 23 AITL patients. No germline mutations were found in the driver genes, implying that they are not frequently involved in genetic AITL predisposition. Potentially pathogenic variants present in at least two patients and showing significant (p &lt; 0.01) enrichment in our sample set were found in ten genes: POLK, PRKCB, ZNF676, PRRC2B, PCDHGB6, GNL3L, TTC36, OTOG, OSGEPL1, and RASSF9. The most significantly enriched variants, causing p.Lys469Ter in a splice variant of POLK and p.Pro588His in PRKCB, are intriguing candidates as Polk deficient mice display a spontaneous mutator phenotype, whereas PRKCB was recently shown to be somatically mutated in 33% of another peripheral T-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell lymphoma. If validated, our findings would provide new insight into the pathogenesis of AITL, as well as tools for early detection in susceptible individuals."	"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the main tick-borne viral infection in Eurasia. Its manifestations range from inapparent infections and fevers with complete recovery to debilitating or fatal encephalitis. The basis of this heterogeneity is largely unknown, but part of this variation is likely due to host genetic. We have previously found that BALB/c mice exhibit intermediate susceptibility to the infection of TBE virus (TBEV), STS mice are highly resistant, whereas the recombinant congenic strain CcS-11, carrying 12.5% of the STS genome on the background of the BALB/c genome is even more susceptible than BALB/c. Importantly, mouse orthologs of human TBE controlling genes Oas1b, Cd209, Tlr3, Ccr5, Ifnl3 and Il10, are in CcS-11 localized on segments derived from the strain BALB/c, so they are identical in BALB/c and CcS-11. As they cannot be responsible for the phenotypic difference of the two strains, we searched for the responsible STS-derived gene-locus. Of course the STS-derived genes in CcS-11 may operate through regulating or epigenetically modifying these non-polymorphic genes of BALB/c origin.To determine the location of the STS genes responsible for susceptibility of CcS-11, we analyzed survival of TBEV-infected F<sub>2</sub> hybrids between BALB/c and CcS-11. CcS-11 carries STS-derived segments on eight chromosomes. These were genotyped in the F<sub>2</sub> hybrid mice and their linkage with survival was tested by binary trait interval mapping. We have sequenced genomes of BALB/c and STS using next generation sequencing and performed bioinformatics analysis of the chromosomal segment exhibiting linkage with TBEV survival.Linkage analysis revealed a novel suggestive survival-controlling locus on chromosome 7 linked to marker D7Nds5 (44.2 Mb). Analysis of this locus for polymorphisms between BALB/c and STS that change RNA stability and genes' functions led to detection of 9 potential candidate genes: Cd33, Klk1b22, Siglece, Klk1b16, Fut2, Grwd1, Abcc6, Otog, and Mkrn3. One of them, Cd33, carried a nonsense mutation in the STS strain.The robust genetic system of recombinant congenic strains of mice enabled detection of a novel suggestive locus on chromosome 7. This locus contains 9 candidate genes, which will be focus of future studies not only in mice but also in humans."	"OTOG was identified as a nonsyndrmoic hearing loss gene in 2012 in two families with nonprogressive mild-to-moderate hearing loss. However, no further literature have this gene for nonsyndromic hearing loss. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether vestibular impairment is involved or not in patients with mutations in OTOG. This study presents a validated second report for homozygous causative mutations in OTOG of mild hearing loss. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in a five-year-old male proband with mild hearing loss. The analysis of WES revealed a homozygous truncating mutation (c.330C &gt; G; p.Tyr110*) in OTOG. The identified novel mutation, p.Tyr110*, leads to a null allele based on the fact that early truncated protein contains no functional domain of otogelin. While defects in otogelin previously reported to result in hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction, p.Tyr110* only caused nonsydromic and nonprogressive hearing loss without any vestibular impairment, indicating that vestibular phenotype would be variable. Given that mild hearing loss is not easy to be detected early, mutations of OTOG may be more prevalent than reported. Therefore, genetic evaluation for OTOG should be considered in children with mild hearing loss with/without vestibular dysfunction."	"What is the role of normally patterned sensory signaling in development of vestibular circuits? For technical reasons, including the difficulty in depriving animals of vestibular inputs, this has been a challenging question to address. Here we take advantage of a vestibular-deficient zebrafish mutant, rock solo <sup>AN66</sup> , in order to examine whether normal sensory input is required for formation of vestibular-driven postural circuitry. We show that the rock solo <sup>AN66</sup> mutant is a splice site mutation in the secreted glycoprotein otogelin (otog), which we confirm through both whole genome sequencing and complementation with an otog early termination mutant. Using confocal microscopy, we find that elements of postural circuits are anatomically normal in rock solo <sup>AN66</sup> mutants, including hair cells, vestibular ganglion neurons, and vestibulospinal neurons. Surprisingly, the balance and postural deficits that are readily apparent in younger larvae disappear around 2 weeks of age. We demonstrate that this behavioral recovery follows the delayed development of the anterior (utricular) otolith, which appears around 14 days post-fertilization (dpf), compared to 1 dpf in WT. These findings indicate that utricular signaling is not required for normal structural development of the inner ear and vestibular nucleus neurons. Furthermore, despite the otolith's developmental delay until well after postural behaviors normally appear, downstream circuits can drive righting reflexes within ∼1-2 days of its arrival, indicating that vestibular circuit wiring is not impaired by a delay in patterned activity. The functional recovery of postural behaviors may shed light on why humans with mutations in otog exhibit only subclinical vestibular deficits."	"Approximately 10 % of the population worldwide suffers from hearing loss (HL) and about 60 % of persons with early onset HL have hereditary hearing loss due to genetic mutations. Highly efficient mutagenesis in mice with the chemical mutagen, ethylnitrosourea (ENU), associated with relevant phenotypic tools represents a powerful approach in producing mouse models for hearing impairment. A benefit of this strategy is to generate alleles to form a series revealing the full spectrum of gene function in vivo. It can also mimic the range of human mutations and polymorphisms for HL. In the course of a genome ENU mutagenesis program, we selected a new mouse model for hearing defect based on a dysmorphological screen. We identified by gene mapping the mutation responsible for this phenotype and characterized it at the histological level of the inner ear and evaluated the vestibule by following the recommendations of the standard operating procedures, IMPReSS. We have identified and characterized a new recessive allele of the otogelin gene, Otog (vbd/vbd) , due to a homozygous one base pair substitution at the splice donor site of intron 29. This mutation leads to a frame-shift and a premature stop codon. We observed a decrease in the amount of sensory cells in the maculae of Otog (vbd/vbd) mice as well as an apparent drastically decreased density to almost absence of the otoconial membrane. Compared to Otog (tm1Prs) and twister, the two other existing otogelin alleles, the detailed analysis of Otog (vbd/vbd) revealed that these mice share some common behavioural characteristics either with Otog (tm1Prs) or twister whereas the fine vestibular phenotype and the hearing defect are different. Our results emphasize the importance of detecting and characterizing a new allele of a gene in order to get comprehensive information about the gene function. "	"Otoliths are biomineralised structures important for balance and hearing in fish. Their counterparts in the mammalian inner ear, otoconia, have a primarily vestibular function. Otoliths and otoconia form over sensory maculae and are attached to the otolithic membrane, a gelatinous extracellular matrix that provides a physical coupling between the otolith and the underlying sensory epithelium. In this study, we have identified two proteins required for otolith tethering in the zebrafish ear, and propose that there are at least two stages to this process: seeding and maintenance. The initial seeding step, in which otolith precursor particles tether directly to the tips of hair cell kinocilia, fails to occur in the einstein (eis) mutant. The gene disrupted in eis is otogelin (otog); mutations in the human OTOG gene have recently been identified as causative for deafness and vestibular dysfunction (DFNB18B). At later larval stages, maintenance of otolith tethering to the saccular macula is dependent on tectorin alpha (tecta) function, which is disrupted in the rolling stones (rst) mutant. α-Tectorin (Tecta) is a major constituent of the tectorial membrane in the mammalian cochlea. Mutations in the human TECTA gene can cause either dominant (DFNA8/12) or recessive (DFNB21) forms of deafness. Our findings indicate that the composition of extracellular otic membranes is highly conserved between mammals and fish, reinforcing the view that the zebrafish is an excellent model system for the study of deafness and vestibular disease. "	"Haploinsufficiency or mutation of TBX1 is largely responsible for the etiology of physical malformations in individuals with velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS/22q11.2 deletion syndrome). TBX1 encodes a transcription factor protein that contains an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain termed the T-box that is shared with other family members. All T-box proteins, examined so far, bind to similar but not identical consensus DNA sequences, indicating that they have specific binding preferences. To identify the TBX1 specific consensus sequence, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) was performed. In contrast to other TBX family members recognizing palindrome sequences, we found that TBX1 preferentially binds to a tandem repeat of 5'-AGGTGTGAAGGTGTGA-3'. We also identified a second consensus sequence comprised of a tandem repeat with a degenerated downstream site. We show that three known human disease-causing TBX1 missense mutations (F148Y, H194Q and G310S) do not alter nuclear localization, or disrupt binding to the tandem repeat consensus sequences, but they reduce transcriptional activity in cell culture reporter assays. To identify Tbx1-downstream genes, we performed an in silico genome wide analysis of potential cis-acting elements in DNA and found strong enrichment of genes required for developmental processes and transcriptional regulation. We found that TBX1 binds to 19 different loci in vitro, which may correspond to putative cis-acting binding sites. In situ hybridization coupled with luciferase gene reporter assays on three gene loci, Fgf8, Bmper, Otog-MyoD, show that these motifs are directly regulated by TBX1 in vitro. Collectively, the present studies establish new insights into molecular aspects of TBX1 binding to DNA. This work lays the groundwork for future in vivo studies, including chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to further elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of VCFS/DGS. "	"Recently, OTOG and OTOGL were identified as human deafness genes. Currently, only four families are known to have autosomal recessive hearing loss based on mutations in these genes. Because the two genes code for proteins (otogelin and otogelin-like) that are strikingly similar in structure and localization in the inner ear, this study is focused on characterizing and comparing the hearing loss caused by mutations in these genes.To evaluate this type of hearing, an extensive set of audiometric and vestibular examinations was performed in the 13 patients from four families.All families show a flat to downsloping configuration of the audiogram with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. Speech recognition scores remain good (&gt;90%). Hearing loss is not significantly different in the four families and the psychophysical test results also do not differ among the families. Vestibular examinations show evidence for vestibular hyporeflexia.Because otogelin and otogelin-like are localized in the tectorial membrane, one could expect a cochlear conductive hearing loss, as was previously shown in DFNA13 (COL11A2) and DFNA8/12 (TECTA) patients. Results of psychophysical examinations, however, do not support this. Furthermore, the authors conclude that there are no phenotypic differences between hearing loss based on mutations in OTOG or OTOGL. This phenotype description will facilitate counseling of hearing loss caused by defects in either of these two genes."
"OTOGL"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Antiviral interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) are possibly responsible for the high tolerance of bats to zoonotic viruses. Previous studies focused on the IFN system of megabats (suborder Yinpterochiroptera). We present statistically robust RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on transcriptomes of cells from the &quot;microbat&quot; Myotis daubentonii (suborder Yangochiroptera) responding at 6 and 24 h to either an IFN-inducing virus or treatment with IFN. Our data reveal genes triggered only by virus, either in both humans and Myotis (CCL4, IFNL3, CH25H), or exclusively in Myotis (STEAP4). Myotis cells also express a series of conserved IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and an unusually high paralog number of the antiviral ISG BST2 (tetherin) but lack several ISGs that were described for megabats (EMC2, FILIP1, IL17RC, OTOGL, SLC24A1). Also, in contrast to megabats, we detected neither different IFN-alpha subtypes nor an unusually high baseline expression of IFNs. Thus, Yangochiroptera microbats, represented by Myotis, may possess an IFN system with distinctive features."	"Mucosal surfaces represent critical routes for entry and exit of pathogens. As such, animals have evolved strategies to combat infection at these sites, in particular the production of mucus to prevent attachment and to promote subsequent movement of the mucus/microbe away from the underlying epithelial surface. Using biochemical, biophysical, and infection studies, we have investigated the host protective properties of the skin mucus barrier of the <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> tadpole. Specifically, we have characterized the major structural component of the barrier and shown that it is a mucin glycoprotein (Otogelin-like or Otogl) with similar sequence, domain organization, and structural properties to human gel-forming mucins. This mucin forms the structural basis of a surface barrier (∼6 μm thick), which is depleted through knockdown of Otogl. Crucially, Otogl knockdown leads to susceptibility to infection by the opportunistic pathogen <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> To more accurately reflect its structure, tissue localization, and function, we have renamed Otogl as <i>Xenopus</i> Skin Mucin, or MucXS. Our findings characterize an accessible and tractable model system to define mucus barrier function and host-microbe interactions."	"Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are uncommon tumors characterized by the presence of inactivating alterations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene in inherited cases and by infrequent somatic mutation in sporadic entities. We performed whole exome sequencing on 11 HB patients to further elucidate the genetics of HBs. A total of 270 somatic variations in 219 genes, of which there were 86 mutations in 67 genes, were found in sporadic HBs, and 184 mutations were found in 154 genes in familial HBs. C: G&gt;T: A and T: A&gt;C: G mutations are relatively common in most HB patients. Genes harboring the most significant mutations include PCDH9, KLHL12, DCAF4L1, and VHL in sporadic HBs, and ZNF814, DLG2, RIMS1, PNN, and MUC7 in familial HBs. The frequency of CNV varied considerably within sporadic HBs but was relatively similar within familial HBs. Five genes, including OTOGL, PLCB4, SCEL, THSD4, and WWOX, have CNVs in the six patients with sporadic HBs, and three genes, including ABCA6, CWC27, and LAMA2, have CNVs in the five patients with familial HBs. We found new genetic mutations and CNVs that might be involved in HBs; these findings highlight the complexity of the tumorigenesis of HBs and pinpoint potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of HBs."	"To screen for the genetic basis of congenital hearing loss in a Syrian family.A Syrian patient living in Lebanon presented with moderate congenital hearing loss. The patient's large nonconsanguineous family was recruited. DNA was extracted from blood samples and sent for whole-exome sequencing. A detailed clinical examination along with audiograms was obtained for all subjects.Hearing loss was noted to be mild to moderate in the low and mid frequencies, sloping to moderate to severe in the high frequencies for all affected members. Results of DNA analysis showed the presence of a previously described p.Arg925* mutation in the OTOGL gene on both alleles in affected family members, whereas nonaffected members either had the wild type or one copy of the mutated allele.Mutations affecting the OTOGL gene have been recently connected with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Seven such mutations have already been described. The p.Arg925* reported in this study has been found once in a French family. The current report is the first to describe this mutation in a Middle Eastern family."	"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common salivary gland malignancy. To explore the genetic origins of MEC, we performed systematic genomic analyses of these tumors.Whole-exome sequencing and gene copy-number analyses were performed for 18 primary cancers with matched normal tissue. FISH was used to determine the presence or absence of the MECT1-MAML2 translocation in 17 tumors.TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in MEC (28%), and mutations were found only in intermediate- and high-grade tumors. Tumors with TP53 mutations had more mutations overall than tumors without TP53 mutations (P = 0.006). POU6F2 was the second most frequently mutated gene, found in three low-grade MECs with the same in-frame deletion. Somatic alterations in IRAK1, MAP3K9, ITGAL, ERBB4, OTOGL, KMT2C, and OBSCN were identified in at least two of the 18 tumors sequenced. FISH analysis confirmed the presence of the MECT1-MAML2 translocation in 15 of 17 tumors (88%).Through these integrated genomic analyses, MECT1-MAML2 translocation and somatic TP53 and POU6F2 mutations appear to be the main drivers of MEC.

In this study, we aim to characterize the clinical feature and the genetic cause of a Chinese DFNB family.Whole exome sequencing was performed on the proband. Co-segregation between the hearing loss phenotype and the potential causative mutations was verified in all family members by Sanger sequencing.Audiologic profiles of the affected family members revealed a moderate hearing loss mainly affecting higher frequencies. Novel biallelic OTOGL mutations, c.6467C&gt;A (p.Ser2156*) and c.6474dupA (p.Ser2159Metfs*2), were identified in this family segregating with the childhood onset DFNB. Both mutations were predicted to cause either nonsense mediated mRNA decay or premature terminations of protein synthesis.We identified novel biallelic OTOGL mutations in a Chinese DFNB family. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of OTOGL mutations causing hearing loss in the East Asian population. Our finding enriched the mutation spectrum of OTOGL associated hearing loss."	"This study was designed to delineate genetic contributions, if any, to sporadic forms of mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) not related to GJB2 mutations (DFNB1) in a pediatric population.We recruited 11 non-DFNB1 simplex cases of mild to moderate SNHL in children. We applied whole-exome sequencing to all 11 probands. We used a filtering strategy assuming that de novo variants of known autosomal dominant (AD) deafness genes, biallelic mutations in autosomal recessive (AR) genes, monoallelic mutations in X chromosome genes for males, and digenic inheritance could be associated. Candidate variants first were prioritized with allele frequency in public databases and confirmed by a phase or a segregation test in each family. Additional information from the literature or public databases was used to identify strong candidate variants.Strong candidate variants were detected in 5 of 11 probands (45.4%). A diverse mode of inheritance implicated the sporadic occurrence of the phenotype. AR mutations in OTOGL and SERPINB6 and digenic inheritance involving two deafness genes, GPR98 and PDZ7, were detected. A de novo AD mutation also was detected in TECTA and MYH14. No syndromic feature was detected in individuals with GPR98/PDZ7 or MYH14 variants in our cohort at this moment.Mild to moderate pediatric SNHL, even if sporadic, features a strong genetic etiology and can manifest via diverse modes of inheritance. In addition, a multidisciplinary approach should be used for a correct diagnosis."	"Average daily gain is an important target trait in pig breeding programs. In this study we performed a genomewide association study for ADG in Italian Large White pigs using a selective genotyping approach. Two extreme and divergent groups of Italian Large White pigs (number 190 + 190) were selected among a population of about 10,000 performance tested gilts (EBV for ADG in the 2 groups were -30 ± 14 g and 81 ± 12 g, respectively) and genotyped with the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. Association analysis was performed treating the pigs of the 2 extreme groups as cases and controls after correction for family-based stratification. A total of 127 SNP resulted significantly associated with ADG (P nominal value [P(raw)] &lt; 2.0 × 10(-7), P &lt; 0.01 Bonferroni corrected [P(Bonferroni)] &lt; 0.01, false discovery rate &lt; 7.76 × 10(-5)). Another 102 SNP were suggestively associated with the target trait (P(raw) between 2.0 × 10(-7) and 2.02 × 10(-6), P(Bonferroni) &lt; 0.10, false discovery rate &lt; 4.19 × 10(-4)). These SNP were located on all autosomes and on porcine chromosome (SSC) X. The largest number of SNP within this list was on SSC5 (n = 42), SSC7 (34), SSC6 (30), SSC4 (23), and SSC16 (16). These chromosomes were richer in significant or suggestively significant markers than expected (P &lt; 0.001). A quite high number of these SNP (n = 23) were associated with backfat thickness in a previous genomewide association study performed in the same pig population, confirming the negative correlation between the 2 traits. Two or more SNP targeted the same gene: IGSF3 and HS2ST1 (SSC4), OTOGL (SSC5), FTO region (SSC6), and MYLK4 and MCUR1 (SSC7). Other regions that were associated with ADG in previous candidate gene studies (e.g., MC4R on SSC1, IGF2 and LDHA on SSC2, MUC4 on SSC13) 1) included markers with P(raw) &lt; 0.01 that, however, did not pass the stringent threshold of significance adopted in this study or 2) could not be tested because not assigned to the Sscrofa10.2 genome version. Functional annotation of the significant regions using Gene Ontology suggested that many and complex processes at different levels are involved in affecting ADG, indicating the complexity of the genetic factors controlling this ultimate phenotype. The obtained results may contribute to understand the genetic mechanisms determining ADG that could open new perspectives to improve selection efficiency in this breed."

We report the identification, by whole exome sequencing, of two different nonsense mutations (c.1558C&gt;T; p.Gln520 and c.2773C&gt;T; p.Arg925) in the otogelin-like gene (OTOGL), in a child affected by mild to moderate isolated deafness. Parental genotypes allowed us to conclude that these mutations are present in the compound heterozygous state in the patient. In addition, our clinical data establish that the tectorial membrane and/or the outer hair cells are defective in this form of deafness."	"Hereditary hearing loss is characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Here we present OTOGL mutations, a homozygous one base pair deletion (c.1430 delT) causing a frameshift (p.Val477Glufs(∗)25) in a large consanguineous family and two compound heterozygous mutations, c.547C&gt;T (p.Arg183(∗)) and c.5238+5G&gt;A, in a nonconsanguineous family with moderate nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. OTOGL maps to the DFNB84 locus at 12q21.31 and encodes otogelin-like, which has structural similarities to the epithelial-secreted mucin protein family. We demonstrate that Otogl is expressed in the inner ear of vertebrates with a transcription level that is high in embryonic, lower in neonatal, and much lower in adult stages. Otogelin-like is localized to the acellular membranes of the cochlea and the vestibular system and to a variety of inner ear cells located underneath these membranes. Knocking down of otogl with morpholinos in zebrafish leads to sensorineural hearing loss and anatomical changes in the inner ear, supporting that otogelin-like is essential for normal inner ear function. We propose that OTOGL mutations affect the production and/or function of acellular structures of the inner ear, which ultimately leads to sensorineural hearing loss."	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
"PJVK"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Gasdermins (GSDMs) belong to a protein superfamily that is found only in vertebrates and consists of GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD, DFNA5 (a.k.a. GSDME) and DFNB59 (a.k.a. Pejvakin (PJVK)) in humans. Except for DFNB59, all members of the GSDM superfamily contain a conserved two-domain structure (N-terminal and C-terminal domains) and share an autoinhibitory mechanism. When the N-terminal domain of these GSDMs is released, it possesses pore-forming activity that causes inflammatory death associated with the loss of cell membrane integrity and release of inflammatory mediators. It has also been found that spontaneous mutations occurring in the genes of GSDMs have been associated with the development of certain autoimmune disorders, as well as cancers. Here, we review the current knowledge of the expression profile and regulation of GSDMs and the important roles of this protein family in inflammatory cell death, tumorigenesis and other related diseases."	"Noise overexposure causes oxidative stress, leading to auditory hair cell damage. Adaptive peroxisome proliferation involving pejvakin, a peroxisome-associated protein from the gasdermin family, has been shown to protect against this harmful oxidative stress. However, the role of pejvakin in peroxisome dynamics and homeostasis remains unclear. Here we show that sound overstimulation induces an early and rapid selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy) in auditory hair cells from wild-type, but not pejvakin-deficient <i>(Pjvk</i><sup>-/-</sup>), mice. Noise overexposure triggers recruitment of the autophagosome-associated protein MAP1LC3B (LC3B; microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β) to peroxisomes in wild-type, but not <i>Pjvk</i><sup>-/-</sup>, mice. We also show that pejvakin-LC3B binding involves an LC3-interacting region within the predicted chaperone domain of pejvakin. In transfected cells and in vivo transduced auditory hair cells, cysteine mutagenesis experiments demonstrated the requirement for both C328 and C343, the two cysteine residues closest to the C terminus of pejvakin, for reactive oxygen species-induced pejvakin-LC3B interaction and pexophagy. The viral transduction of auditory hair cells from <i>Pjvk</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice in vivo with both Pjvk and Lc3b cDNAs completely restored sound-induced pexophagy, fully prevented the development of oxidative stress, and resulted in normal levels of peroxisome proliferation, whereas Pjvk cDNA alone yielded only a partial correction of the defects. Overall, our results demonstrate that pexophagy plays a key role in noise-induced peroxisome proliferation and identify defective pexophagy as a cause of noise-induced hearing loss. They suggest that pejvakin acts as a redox-activated pexophagy receptor/adaptor, thereby identifying a previously unknown function of gasdermin family proteins."	"Hearing loss (HL) is the most prevalent sensory disorder. The over 100 genes implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) makes it difficult to analyze and determine the accurate genetic causes of hearing loss. We sought to de?ne the frequency of seven hearing loss-Causing causing genetic Variants in four genes in an Iranian population with hearing loss.One hundred ARNSHL patients with normal GJB2/GJB6 genes were included, and targeted mutations in SLC26A4, MYO6, PJVK and CDH23 genes were analyzed by ARMS-PCR. The negative and positive results were confirmed by the Sanger sequencing.We found only two mutations, one in MYO6 (c.554-1 G &gt; A) gene and another in PJVK (c.547C &gt; T).c.554-1G &gt; A and c.547C &gt; T mutations are responsible for 1% each of the Iranian ARNSHL patients. These genes are not a frequent cause of ARNSHL in an Iranian population."	"The Gasdermin (GSDM) family consists of Gasdermin A (GSDMA), Gasdermin B (GSDMB), Gasdermin C (GSDMC), Gasdermin D (GSDMD), Gasdermin E (GSDME) and Pejvakin (PJVK). GSDMD is activated by inflammasome-associated inflammatory caspases. Cleavage of GSDMD by human or mouse caspase-1, human caspase-4, human caspase-5, and mouse caspase-11 liberates the N-terminal effector domain from the C-terminal inhibitory domain. The N-terminal domain oligomerizes in the cell membrane and forms a pore of 10-16 nm in diameter, through which substrates of a smaller diameter, such as interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, are secreted. The increasing abundance of membrane pores ultimately leads to membrane rupture and pyroptosis, releasing the entire cellular content. Other than GSDMD, the N-terminal domain of all GSDMs, with the exception of PJVK, have the ability to form pores. There is evidence to suggest that GSDMB and GSDME are cleaved by apoptotic caspases. Here, we review the mechanistic functions of GSDM proteins with respect to their expression and signaling profile in the cell, with more focused discussions on inflammasome activation and cell death."	"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss is a heterogeneous disorder and the most prevalent human genetic sensorineural defect. In this study, we investigated the geneticcause of sensorineural hearing loss in Moroccan patients and presented the importance of whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify candidate genes in two Moroccan families with profound deafness.After excluding mutations previously reported in Moroccan deaf patients, whole exome sequencing was performed and Sanger sequencing was used to validate mutations in these genes.Our results disclosed the c.113_114insT (p.Lys41GlufsX8) and c.406C &gt; T (p.Arg130X) homozygous mutations in PJVK and a homozygous c.5203C &gt; T (p.Arg1735Trp) mutation in MYO15A, both genes responsible for non-syndromic recessive hearing loss DFNB59 and DFNB3, respectively.We identified in Moroccan deaf patients two mutations in PJVK and one mutation in MYO15A described for the first time in association with non-syndromic recessive hearing loss. These results emphasize that whole exome sequencing is a powerful diagnostic strategy to identify pathogenic mutations in heterogeneous disorders with many various causative genes."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Mutations in the <i>Pejvakin</i> (<i>PJVK</i>) gene are thought to cause auditory neuropathy and hearing loss of cochlear origin by affecting noise-induced peroxisome proliferation in auditory hair cells and neurons. Here we demonstrate that loss of pejvakin in hair cells, but not in neurons, causes profound hearing loss and outer hair cell degeneration in mice. Pejvakin binds to and colocalizes with the rootlet component TRIOBP at the base of stereocilia in injectoporated hair cells, a pattern that is disrupted by deafness-associated <i>PJVK</i> mutations. Hair cells of pejvakin-deficient mice develop normal rootlets, but hair bundle morphology and mechanotransduction are affected before the onset of hearing. Some mechanotransducing shorter row stereocilia are missing, whereas the remaining ones exhibit overextended tips and a greater variability in height and width. Unlike previous studies of <i>Pjvk</i> alleles with neuronal dysfunction, our findings reveal a cell-autonomous role of pejvakin in maintaining stereocilia architecture that is critical for hair cell function.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Two missense mutations in the <i>Pejvakin</i> (<i>PJVK</i> or <i>DFNB59</i>) gene were first identified in patients with audiological hallmarks of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder, whereas all other <i>PJVK</i> alleles cause hearing loss of cochlear origin. These findings suggest that complex pathogenetic mechanisms underlie human deafness DFNB59. In contrast to recent studies, we demonstrate that pejvakin in auditory neurons is not essential for normal hearing in mice. Moreover, pejvakin localizes to stereociliary rootlets in hair cells and is required for stereocilia maintenance and mechanosensory function of the hair bundle. Delineating the site of the lesion and the mechanisms underlying DFNB59 will allow clinicians to predict the efficacy of different therapeutic approaches, such as determining compatibility for cochlear implants."	"Mutations in the Pejvakin (Pjvk) gene cause autosomal recessive hearing loss DFNB59 with audiological features of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) or cochlear dysfunction. The precise mechanisms underlying the variable clinical phenotypes of DFNB59 remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that mice with conditional ablation of the Pjvk gene in all sensory hair cells or only in outer hair cells (OHCs) show similar auditory phenotypes with early-onset profound hearing loss. By contrast, loss of Pjvk in adult OHCs causes a slowly progressive hearing loss associated with OHC degeneration and delayed loss of inner hair cells (IHCs), indicating a primary role for pejvakin in regulating OHC function and survival. Consistent with this model, synaptic transmission at the IHC ribbon synapse is largely unaffected in sirtaki mice that carry a C-terminal deletion mutation in Pjvk. Using the C-terminal domain of pejvakin as bait, we identified in a cochlear cDNA library ROCK2, an effector for the small GTPase Rho, and the scaffold protein IQGAP1, involved in modulating actin dynamics. Both ROCK2 and IQGAP1 associate via their coiled-coil domains with pejvakin. We conclude that pejvakin is required to sustain OHC activity and survival in a cell-autonomous manner likely involving regulation of Rho signaling."	"To evaluate the contribution of eight small NSHL-AR (non-syndromic deafness, autosomal recessive) genes to hereditary hearing loss in Czech patients.Unrelated Czech patients, adults and children, diagnosed with pre-lingual hereditary hearing loss with at least one similarly affected deaf sibling and with previously excluded mutations in the GJB2 gene were investigated by Sanger sequencing of the selected eight small NSHL-AR associated genes (CABP2 - 51 patients, CIB2 - 45 patients, PJVK/DFNB59 - 53 patients, GJB3 - 46 patients, ILDR1 - 48 patients, LHFPL5 - 66 patients, LRTOMT - 60 patients, TMIE - 64 patients).Mutations were detected in the LHFPL5 (DFNB67) gene. The patient is heterozygote for two already described pathogenic variants (p.Tyr127Cys, p.Thr165Met). In five samples, five rare heterozygous variants (two novel) predicted as pathogenic were detected in genes CABP2, ILDR1, LHFPL5 and LRTOMT.Mutations in eight small NSHL-AR genes are not a frequent cause of hereditary hearing loss in the Czech Republic. This diagnostic approach permitted the clarification of HL in only one patient - two heterozygous mutations were detected in LHFPL5 gene for the first time in Central Europe. As the use of panel base MPS certainly improves the diagnostic yield, future studies should rather profit from that diagnostic strategy."	"Auditory neuropathy is a type of hearing loss that constitutes a change in the conduct of the auditory stimulus by the involvement of inner hair cells or auditory nerve synapses. It is characterized by the absence or alteration of waves in the examination of brainstem auditory evoked potentials, with otoacoustic and/or cochlear microphonic issues. At present, four loci associated with non‑syndromic auditory neuropathy have been mapped: Autosomal recessive deafness‑9 [DFNB9; the otoferlin (OTOF) gene] and autosomal recessive deafness‑59 [DFNB59; the pejvakin (PJVK) gene], associated with autosomal recessive inheritance; the autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy gene [AUNA1; the diaphanous‑3 (DIAPH3) gene]; and AUNX1, linked to chromosome X. Furthermore, mutations of connexin 26 [the gap junction β2 (GJB2) gene] have also been associated with the disease. OTOF gene mutations exert a significant role in auditory neuropathy. In excess of 80 pathogenic mutations have been identified in individuals with non‑syndromic deafness in populations of different origins, with an emphasis on the p.Q829X mutation, which was found in ~3% of cases of deafness in the Spanish population. The identification of genetic alterations responsible for auditory neuropathy is one of the challenges contributing to understand the molecular bases of the different phenotypes of hearing loss. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate molecular changes in the OTOF gene in patients with auditory neuropathy, and to develop a DNA chip for the molecular diagnosis of auditory neuropathy using mass spectrometry for genotyping. Genetic alterations were investigated in 47 patients with hearing loss and clinical diagnosis of auditory neuropathy, and the c.35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene was identified in three homozygous patients, and the heterozygous parents of one of these cases. Additionally, OTOF gene mutations were tracked by complete sequencing of 48 exons, although these results are still preliminary. Studying the genetic basis of auditory neuropathy is of utmost importance for obtaining a differential diagnosis, developing more specific treatments and more accurate genetic counseling. "	"A deficiency in pejvakin, a protein of unknown function, causes a strikingly heterogeneous form of human deafness. Pejvakin-deficient (Pjvk(-/-)) mice also exhibit variable auditory phenotypes. Correlation between their hearing thresholds and the number of pups per cage suggest a possible harmful effect of pup vocalizations. Direct sound or electrical stimulation show that the cochlear sensory hair cells and auditory pathway neurons of Pjvk(-/-) mice and patients are exceptionally vulnerable to sound. Subcellular analysis revealed that pejvakin is associated with peroxisomes and required for their oxidative-stress-induced proliferation. Pjvk(-/-) cochleas display features of marked oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defenses, and peroxisomes in Pjvk(-/-) hair cells show structural abnormalities after the onset of hearing. Noise exposure rapidly upregulates Pjvk cochlear transcription in wild-type mice and triggers peroxisome proliferation in hair cells and primary auditory neurons. Our results reveal that the antioxidant activity of peroxisomes protects the auditory system against noise-induced damage."	"Pejvakin (PJVK), a protein originally identified in Persian families with sensorineural hearing loss, regulates peroxisomal dynamics and the antioxidant defense triggered by noise exposure in hair cells and auditory neurons of the inner ear. These findings bring peroxisomes to the forefront of noise-induced hearing loss research. "	"Cochlear implantation is currently the treatment of choice for children with severe to profound hearing impairment. However, the outcomes with cochlear implants (CIs) vary significantly among recipients. The purpose of the present study is to identify the genetic determinants of poor CI outcomes. Twelve children with poor CI outcomes (the &quot;cases&quot;) and 30 &quot;matched controls&quot; with good CI outcomes were subjected to comprehensive genetic analyses using massively parallel sequencing, which targeted 129 known deafness genes. Audiological features, imaging findings, and auditory/speech performance with CIs were then correlated to the genetic diagnoses. We identified genetic variants which are associated with poor CI outcomes in 7 (58%) of the 12 cases; 4 cases had bi-allelic PCDH15 pathogenic mutations and 3 cases were homozygous for the DFNB59 p.G292R variant. Mutations in the WFS1, GJB3, ESRRB, LRTOMT, MYO3A, and POU3F4 genes were detected in 7 (23%) of the 30 matched controls. The allele frequencies of PCDH15 and DFNB59 variants were significantly higher in the cases than in the matched controls (both P &lt; 0.001). In the 7 CI recipients with PCDH15 or DFNB59 variants, otoacoustic emissions were absent in both ears, and imaging findings were normal in all 7 implanted ears. PCDH15 or DFNB59 variants are associated with poor CI performance, yet children with PCDH15 or DFNB59 variants might show clinical features indistinguishable from those of other typical pediatric CI recipients. Accordingly, genetic examination is indicated in all CI candidates before operation."	"To our knowledge, this is the first report of PJVK gene mutation in a Chinese non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL) family. Our data indicate that the PJVK gene contributes to hearing impairment in the Chinese population, but it is not a major cause.To investigate the contribution of PJVK mutations to NSHL in the Chinese population.We screened for the PJVK gene in a sample of 65 autosomal recessive NSHL families without GJB2, SLC26A4, or mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene mutations. Seven pairs of PCR primers were designed to amplify all of the exons and their flanking regions of the PJVK gene. The PCR products were sequenced and analyzed for identification of mutations.In all, we identiﬁed one novel frameshift mutation, c.930_931del AC (p.C312W fsX19), co-segregating with the phenotype in one consanguineous family with a prevalence of 1.5% (1/65). The p.C312W fsX19 mutation was just positioned in the zinc-fingers domain, which was important to the function of pejvakin, and resulted in a stop codon after 19 additional amino acids. It was not identiﬁed in the controls and was considered as the causative mutation of family 804566 with autosomal recessive, non-syndromic, prelingual sensorineural hearing impairment."	"The prevalence of hearing impairment is estimated as approximately 1 on 1,000 newborn children. To assess a higher mutation detection rate in individuals with hearing loss a three-step mutation screening program consisting of GJB2 in first line, then GJB1, GJB3 and GJB6 (second step) and if tested negative or heterozygote, testing of GJA1, GJB4, SLC26A4 and PJVK (third) was performed. Audiograms were derived from all patients to characterize audiological features of GJB2 mutations especially. In 59 patients (31.3%) of the 188 probands, the hearing impairment was due to GJB2 mutations, 45 (23.9%) of these being homozygous for 35delG mutation and 14 (7.4%) compound heterozygous for GJB2 mutations in the coding region of exon 2 whereas no significant sequence variation was found in exon 1. In 22 (11.7%) additional patients a single recessive mutation in GJB2, GJB3, GJB6 and SLC26A4 without a second mutation on the other allele was identified, making genetic counseling difficult. Our study showed significant difference in hearing loss degree in the patients with GJB2-mutations. Forty-five (45.5%) GJB2-cases were identified in 99 individuals diagnosed with severe to profound hearing loss, 14 (17.7%) GJB2-cases were identified in 79 individuals with moderate deafness whereas no clear GJB2 mutation was found in 10 patients with mild hearing loss (p &lt; 0.001). Revealing a high variability of hearing levels in identical genotypes (even intrafamilial), a significant genotype-phenotype correlation could not be established. Based on the identified mutations spectrum and frequencies, speaking mostly of GJB2, a step by step screening for mutations can be devised and in addition may lead to a better stratification of patients for specific therapeutical approaches."	"(1) To describe the frequency of the OTOF mutations among Korean ARNSHL (autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss) populations; (2) to report the vertical transmission of DFNB9 in a family, where two related DFNB9 patients in the family manifested a different audiological phenotype.We analyzed the prevalence of OTOF mutations among 71 Korean sporadic or possible ARNSHL pediatric patients, as well as among AN/AD (auditory neuropathy/auditory dys-synchrony) patients by direct PCR (polymerase chain reaction) sequencing or targeted resequencing of known deafness genes.The AN/AD phenotype which was characterized by preservation of OAE (otoacoustic emission) was present in 5 (7%) of 71 probands, and the prevalence of OTOF mutations was calculated to be 20% (1/5) and 1.4% (1/71) among AN/AD patients and total sporadic/ARNSHL patients, respectively. PJVK mutations did not account for Non-DFNB9 AN/AD patients. To our interest, the only proband (SB4-11) with two OTOF mutant alleles in our cohort had deaf parents, who also turned out to be DFNB9. We identified a novel splice site variant of OTOF from the mother (SB4-13) of SB4-11. This was the first observation of vertical transmission of DFNB9 phenotype from parents to son in this population where the prevalence of OTOF is very low and consanguineous marriage is not allowed. Another DFNB9 patient (SB4-12), the father of SB4-11, carried a homozygous p.Y374X mutation that affected only the long isoform of OTOF and did not manifest AN/AD.The OTOF mutations do not contribute significantly to Korean ARNSHL and AN/AD unlike in Japan and Taiwan. This low prevalence mandates a search for other etiologies. Our observation of the discordant audiologic phenotype within the same DFNB9 family is more likely due to the loss of OAE over time rather than a genotype-phenotype correlation."	"Toothed whales and bats have independently evolved specialized ultrasonic hearing for echolocation. Recent findings have suggested that several genes including Prestin, Tmc1, Pjvk and KCNQ4 appear to have undergone molecular adaptations associated with the evolution of this ultrasonic hearing in mammals. Here we studied the hearing gene Cldn14, which encodes the claudin-14 protein and is a member of tight junction proteins that functions in the organ of Corti in the inner ear to maintain a cationic gradient between endolymph and perilymph. Particular mutations in human claudin-14 give rise to non-syndromic deafness, suggesting an essential role in hearing. Our results uncovered two bursts of positive selection, one in the ancestral branch of all toothed whales and a second in the branch leading to the delphinid, phocoenid and ziphiid whales. These two branches are the same as those previously reported to show positive selection in the Prestin gene. Furthermore, as with Prestin, the estimated hearing frequencies of whales significantly correlate with numbers of branch-wise non-synonymous substitutions in Cldn14, but not with synonymous changes. However, in contrast to Prestin, we found no evidence of positive selection in bats. Our findings from Cldn14, and comparisons with Prestin, strongly implicate multiple loci in the acquisition of echolocation in cetaceans, but also highlight possible differences in the evolutionary route to echolocation taken by whales and bats. "	"Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) is caused by dys-synchronous auditory neural response as a result of impairment of the functions of the auditory nerve or inner hair cells, or synapses between inner hair cells and the auditory nerve. To identify a causative gene causing ANSD in the Korean population, we conducted gene screening of the OTOF, DIAPH3, and PJVK genes in 19 unrelated Korean patients with ANSD. A novel nonsense mutation (p.Y1064X) and a known pathogenic mutation (p.R1939Q) of the OTOF gene were identified in a patient as compound heterozygote. Pedigree analysis for these mutations showed co-segregation of mutation genotype and the disease in the family, and it supported that the p.Y1064X might be a novel genetic cause of autosomal recessive ANSD. A novel missense variant p.K1017R (c.3050A&gt;G) in the DIAPH3 gene was also identified in the heterozygous state. In contrast, no mutation was detected in the PJVK gene. These results indicate that no major causative gene has been reported to date in the Korean population and that pathogenic mutations in undiscovered candidate genes may have an effect on ANSD."	"Up to 10% of permanent hearing impairments in children originate from lesions in the neuronal auditory pathway. This form of auditory neuron injury called auditory neuropathy features a preservation of outer hair cell integrity but an impaired inner hair cell function and/or neuronal transmission. DFNB59 gene encodes the protein pejvakin (PJVK) and its mutations cause autosomal recessive auditory neuropathy as well as other forms of sensorineural hearing loss. The finding of distinct forms of hearing anomalies was based on studies of consanguineous families from different ethnic groups as well as studies in mice with PJVK gene mutations. In the present immunohistochemical study, the distribution of pejvakin protein in surgically obtained human cochleae was for the first time investigated. The human cochleae had normal hearing thresholds before the operation. The expression of pejvakin was located in the cell bodies of all spiral ganglion neurons rather than the nerve fibers that were labeled with Tuj 1 antibody. As Tuj 1 antibody stained the cytoplasm of Type 1 cells, pejvakin antibody labeled both type 1 and type 2 cells. The nuclei of the neurons were also PJVK-positive. No labeling was seen in the structures within the organ of Corti and the stria vascularis. In the previous study, PJVK had been detected in the hair cells, the spiral ganglion, the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, and the inferior colliculus in mouse. Our study demonstrated for the first time the expression of PJVK in human spiral ganglion neurons. Its functional role in neural signal propagation and synchrony needs further elucidation. "	"Mutations in PJVK, encoding Pejvakin, cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in humans at the DFNB59 locus on chromosome 2q31.2. Pejvakin is involved in generating auditory and neural signals in the inner ear. We have identified a consanguineous Pakistani family segregating sensorineural progressive hearing loss as a recessive trait, consistent with linkage to DFNB59. We sequenced PJVK and identified a novel missense mutation, c.1028G&gt;C in exon 7 (p.C343S) co-segregating with the phenotype in the family. The p.C343 residue is fully conserved among orthologs from different vertebrate species. We have also determined that mutations in PJVK are not a common cause of hearing loss in families with moderate to severe hearing loss in Pakistan. This is the first report of PJVK mutation in a Pakistani family and pinpoints an important residue for PJVK function."
"RDX"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Composition C4 is a plastic explosive substance used in military combat units for demolition. The active component of composition C4 is hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, also known as RDX (Royal Demolition Explosive). There are limited reports of the effects of ingested C4. We sought to provide a broad overview of cyclonite/RDX exposure in humans to give a general understanding of both the clinical effects of exposure as well as management considerations. The authors searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar for articles using the keywords for this literature review, including case reports, case series, animal studies, clinical guidelines, and reviews. There are few reports and studies of C4 ingestion. In these studies, the most common effects are serious central nervous system (CNS) effects followed by renal and gastrointestinal symptoms. Critical actions involve airway control, seizure control, and adequate fluid hydration. The toxidrome of this ingestion is typically transient and management is primarily supportive."	"We report the whole-genome sequence of <i>Gordonia</i> sp. strain YY1, which was isolated from the surface soil in an explosive-contaminated site in Israel and cultivated with hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, i.e., royal demolition explosive (RDX), as a nitrogen source. This genome sequence will improve our understanding of the genes for RDX degradation. In addition, this research will reveal metabolic pathways in order to develop new bioremediation methods for polluted soil and groundwater."	"It is well known that imidazoles, possessing two or more nitro substituents, are potential candidates for highly energetic explosives with detonation parameters comparable to those of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane. 4,4',5,5'-Tetranitro-2,2'-bi-imidazole (TNBI) is a typical imidazole explosive with energy equivalent to that of RDX but suffers from low sensitivity (impact sensitivity 7 J). 1,1'-Diamino-4,4',5,5'-tetranitro-2,2'-biimidazole (DATNBI), a derivative of TNBI, possesses two -NH<sub>2</sub> groups and has a higher detonation velocity (9063 m s<sup>-1</sup>) and lower impact sensitivity of 15 J, which indicates great potential for future applications. Examination of the thermal decomposition mechanism and kinetics of TNBI and DATNBI gives a more comprehensive view of the influence that the -NH<sub>2</sub> group has on the sensitivity and storage safety of the energetic explosive-based TNBI molecular skeleton. Herein, the thermal decomposition mechanism is studied, showing that detachment of -NH<sub>2</sub> groups from DATNBI generates 1-diamino-4,4',5,5'-tetranitro-2,2'-biimidazole (ATNBI) and TNBI and induces self-decomposition. Although the decomposition peak temperature of DATNBI is significantly lower than that of TNBI at the same heating rate; its self-accelerating decomposition temperature (50 kg) is only 4 K lower. Therefore, the -NH<sub>2</sub> group displays good ability of reducing sensitivity but has no influence on storage safety of DATNBI."	"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most common gastrointestinal disorders encountered in primary and secondary care and is associated with impaired quality of life, increased healthcare utilization, and significant costs to patients and society. There are three primary phenotypes of IBS, categorized according to stool pattern: IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with constipation (IBS-C) and IBS with a mixed bowel pattern (IBS-M). The treatment approach to all forms of IBS is typically hierarchal, with initial therapies consisting of dietary and lifestyle modifications. When these interventions are impractical or ineffective, pharmacotherapy with over-the-counter and prescription therapies is often employed. Tenapanor is a locally acting, minimally absorbed, selective small-molecule inhibitor of the intestinal sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) that was approved in September 2019 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for IBS-C. This agent works by increasing the sodium level in the intestinal lumen and promoting the efflux of fluid into the gut lumen to maintain osmotic balance in addition to having an antinociceptive effect. Tenapanor has been shown to improve bowel movement frequency/form and abdominal pain in patients with IBS-C. This article will elaborate on the clinical development program for tenapanor for this indication."	"Munitions compounds (i.e., 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), octahy-dro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocin (HMX), and hexadydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazin (RDX), also called energetics) were originally believed to be recalcitrant to microbial biodegradation based on historical groundwater chemical attenuation data and laboratory culture work. More recently, it has been established that natural bacterial assemblages in coastal waters and sediment can rapidly metabolize these organic nitrogen sources and even incorporate their carbon and nitrogen into bacterial biomass. Here, we report on the capacity of natural microbial assemblages in three coastal North Carolina (United States) estuaries to metabolize energetics and phenanthrene (PHE), a proxy for terrestrial aromatic compounds. Microbial assemblages generally had the highest ecosystem capacity (mass of the compound mineralized per average estuarine residence time) for HMX (21-5463 kg) &gt; RDX (1.4-5821 kg) ≫ PHE (0.29-660 kg) &gt; TNT (0.25-451 kg). Increasing antecedent precipitation tended to decrease the ecosystem capacity to mineralize TNT in the Newport River Estuary, and PHE and TNT mineralization were often highest with increasing salinity. There was some evidence from the New River Estuary that increased N-demand (due to a phytoplankton bloom) is associated with increased energetic mineralization rates. Using this type of analysis to determine the ecosystem capacity to metabolize energetics can explain why these compounds are rarely detected in seawater and marine sediment, despite the known presence of unexploded ordnance or recent use in military training exercises. Overall, measuring the ecosystem capacity may help predict the effects of climate change (warming and altered precipitation patterns) and other perturbations on exotic compound fate and transport within ecosystems and provide critical information for managers and decision-makers to develop management strategies based on these changes."	"In the current manuscript, we explored the remediation potential of Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) by Gram-positive Microbacterium esteraromaticum 12849. The strain detoxified 70.9 and 63.93% RDX in minimal nutrient medium and soil, respectively. Subsequently, the strain 12849 was formulated in form of water-dispersible granules (WDG) using talcum powder and alginic acid as inert ingredients. During the microcosm study, WDG exhibited 8.98% enhanced RDX degradation in contrast to the unformulated Microbacterium esteraromaticum. The LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of two intermediates, namely N-methyl-N, N'-dinitromethanediamine, and methylenedintramine, during the RDX degradation by strain 12849 in soil. Interestingly, no significant difference was observed in the rate of RDX degradation by strain 12849 due to the formulation process. The first-order kinetics was seen in RDX degradation with a degradation coefficient of 0.04 and 0.0339 day<sup>-1</sup> by formulated and unformulated strain, respectively. The current investigation implies M. esteraromaticum as a potential microbe for RDX degradation and opens up the possibility of exploiting it in its effective WDG form for explosive contaminated sites."	"In order to develop new high-energy materials utilizing natural products, a high-substitute nitrochitosan was prepared with different methods. Prepared processes and detonation properties of the nitrochitosan samples were systematically studied. The nitration substitute degree, nitrogen content, exothermic decomposition enthalpy, heat of combustion, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity and detonation pressure of the prepared high-substitute nitrochitosan were 2.01, 16.67 %, -2226 J g<sup>-1</sup>, -7831.6 ± 116.3 J g<sup>-1</sup>, &gt;14.2 J, 7.81 km s<sup>-1</sup>, and 24.03 GPa, respectively. Compared with nitrocellulose (NC), the nitrogen content, impact sensitivity and detonation properties of the prepared nitrochitosan were significantly improved. Nitrochitosan and RDX can form a uniform composite in acetone. With the increase of RDX content, the impact sensitivity of composite increased, but the composite was more stable and not easy to decompose. High-substitute nitrochitosan presents a potential application in solid propellants."	"1,3,5-Trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) are the classic high energy nitramine compounds. Herein, we performed simulations of the overall decomposition pathways of condensed α-RDX and ε-CL-20 by applying the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) method. Both of them appear to have similar distinct initial decomposition pathways, which are the bond cleavages of N-NO2 bonds. Interestingly, we find that the continuous explosion is nonspontaneous without the participation of self-produced hydrogen radicals of RDX or oxygen radicals of CL-20. Increased radicals are produced gradually with increasing temperature, which activates further entropy-increased steps, resulting in the uncontrollable transition of deflagration to detonation with the formation of NOx, COx and HCN. Herein, we provide a detailed and systematic description of the decomposition for unit-cell α-RDX and ε-CL-20 under increased temperature, which can be summarized as C3H6O6N6 (RDX) → NO + HNO + H2 + CO2 + HCHO + HNCN + N2O and C6H6O12N12 (CL-20) → NO + HONO + 5HCN + CO2 + N2O + 3NO2."	"In the present study, an anaerobic microbial consortium for the degradation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) was selectively enriched with the co-addition of RDX and starch under nitrogen-deficient conditions. Microbial growth and anaerobic RDX biodegradation were effectively enhanced by the co-addition of RDX and starch, which resulted in increased RDX biotransformation to nitroso-derivatives at a greater specific degradation rate than those for previously reported anaerobic RDX-degrading bacteria (isolates). The accumulation of the most toxic RDX degradation intermediate (MNX [hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine]) was significantly reduced by starch addition, suggesting improved RDX detoxification by the co-addition of RDX and starch. The subsequent MiSeq sequencing that targeted the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that the <i>Sporolactobacillus</i>, <i>Clostridium</i>, and <i>Paenibacillus</i> populations were involved in the enhanced anaerobic RDX degradation. These results suggest that these three bacterial populations are important for anaerobic RDX degradation and detoxification. The findings from this work imply that the <i>Sporolactobacillus</i>, <i>Clostridium</i>, and <i>Paenibacillus</i> dominant microbial consortium may be valuable for the development of bioremediation resource for RDX-contaminated environments."	"The objective of this work was to measure infrared spectra of high explosive materials (HE) in wide spectral range in order to acquire information for their complete characterization and find out the regions that are the most discriminatory for each material. Four HEs were measured by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in a very broad range (from near- via mid- to far-IR). Obtained spectra were subsequently evaluated using multivariate statistical methods for dimension reduction and results grouping. Clustering was assessed in terms of compactness and stability in order to distinguish which region or regions are most suitable for the identification based on spectral signature. Based on outcomes of visualization method (silhouette plot) used to compare results of implemented chemometric methods (HCA, PAM, and PCA) done on FTIR spectra collected for four high explosive materials (PETN, C-4, RDX, and TNT) within all regions, it seems that the mid-IR region is the most informative for the distinction among analyzed HE materials based on substance spectral signatures. However, it is worth noticing that also the near-IR region can be used for good differentiation."	"Understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in the decomposition of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) still represents a major challenge for the energetic materials and physical (organic) chemistry communities mainly because multiple competing dissociation channels are likely involved and previous detection methods of the products are not isomer selective. In this study we exploited a microsecond pulsed infrared laser to decompose thin RDX films at 5 K under mild conditions to limit the fragmentation channels. The subliming decomposition products during the temperature programed desorption phase are detected using isomer selective single photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PI-ReTOF-MS). This technique enables us to assign a product signal at m/z=42 to ketene (H<sub>2</sub> CCO), but not to diazomethane (H<sub>2</sub> CNN; 42 amu) as speculated previously. Electronic structure calculations support our experimental observations and unravel the decomposition mechanisms of RDX leading eventually to the elusive ketene (H<sub>2</sub> CCO) via an exotic, four-membered ring intermediate. This study highlights the necessity to exploit isomer-selective detection schemes to probe the true decomposition products of nitramine-based energetic materials."	"This study utilized innovative analyses to develop multiple lines of evidence for natural attenuation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in groundwater at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pantex Plant. RDX, as well as the degradation product 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal (NDAB; produced by aerobic biodegradation or alkaline hydrolysis) were detected in a large portion of the plume, with lower concentrations of the nitroso-containing metabolites produced during anaerobic biodegradation. 16S metagenomic sequencing detected the presence of bacteria known to aerobically degrade RDX (e.g., Gordonia, Rhodococcus) and NDAB (Methylobacterium), as well as the known anoxic RDX degrader Pseudomonas fluorescens I-C. Proteomic analysis detected both the aerobic RDX degradative enzyme XplA, and the anoxic RDX degradative enzyme XenB. Groundwater enrichment cultures supplied with low concentrations of labile carbon confirmed the potential of the extant groundwater community to aerobically degrade RDX and produce NDAB. Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of RDX collected at the site showed fractionation of nitrogen isotopes with δ<sup>15</sup>N values ranging from approximately -5‰ to +9‰, providing additional evidence of RDX degradation. Taken together, these results provide evidence of in situ RDX degradation in the Pantex Plant groundwater. Furthermore, they demonstrate the benefit of multiple lines of evidence in supporting natural attenuation assessments, especially with the application of innovative isotopic and -omic technologies."	"Terrorism by means of explosives has become a crucial threat. Nanoparticles with distinctive properties can offer novel aspects for instant detection of explosive materials. Common explosives are organic compounds that contain nitro group (NO<sub>2</sub>) along with carbon and hydrogen elements. This study demonstrates complete identification of nitramine explosives (RDX &amp; HMX) using colloidal silica nanoparticles. Sustainable fabrication of colloidal silica was conducted via hydrothermal processing technique. Explosive identification involves a digestion of the tested material using strong acid. The digestion process results in the development of nitro group and corresponding formaldehyde segment. The identification of the nitro group was performed using colloidal silica nanoparticles functionalized with secondary amine to develop a characteristic dark blue colour. Simultaneous identification of formaldehyde segment was performed using colloidal silica functionalized with aromatic phenol to develop a red colour. This robust explosive detection technology can find wide applications on site where instant identification to assess potential threat is a crucial demand. Thanks to hydrothermal processing, sustainable fabrication and surface modification of colloidal silica particles can be obtained."	"The development of recyclable surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based sensors has been in huge demand for trace level explosives detection. A simple, hybrid Silicon (Si) nanotextured target-based SERS platform is fabricated through patterning micro square arrays (MSA) on Si using femtosecond (fs) laser ablation technique at different fluences. Using the hybrid target Si MSA substrate loaded/decorated with Ag-Au alloy NPs (obtained using femtosecond ablation in liquids) we demonstrate the trace level detection of organic nitro-explosives [picric acid (PA), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and 1, 3, 5-trinitroperhydro-1, 3, 5-triazine (RDX)] and their mixtures. The microstructures/nanostructures of MSA fabricated at an input fluence of 9.55 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, and decorated with Ag-Au alloy NPs, exhibited exceptional SERS enhancement factors (EFs) up to ∼10<sup>10</sup> for MB, ∼10<sup>6</sup> for PA, and ∼10<sup>4</sup> for RDX with the detection limits obtained being ∼5 pM, ∼36 nM, and ∼400 nM for MB, PA and RDX respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate these SERS substrates possess good reproducibility (RSD values &lt; 15%) and a superior performance compared to a commercial Ag substrate (SERSitive, Poland). Three binary mixtures, i.e. MB-PA, MB-DNT, PA-DNT at different concentrations, were also investigated using the same SERS substrate to test the efficacy. Further, the SERS spectra of dyes, explosives, and complex mixtures were utilized for discrimination/classification using principal component analysis."	"A new energetic curing reagent, Glycidyl azide polymer grafted tetrafunctional isocyanate (N100-<i>g</i>-GAP) was synthesized and characterized by FT-IR and GPC approaches. Polytriazole polyethylene oxide-tetrahydrofuran (PTPET) elastomer was prepared by N100-<i>g</i>-GAP and alkynyl terminated polyethylene oxide-tetrahydrofuran (ATPET). The resulting PTPET elastomer was fully characterized by TGA, DMA, FTIR and mechanical test. The above analysis indicates that PTPET elastomers using N100-<i>g</i>-GAP as curing reagent have the potential for use in propellants. The overall formulation test of the composite propellants shows that this curing system can effectively enhance mechanical strength and bring a significant improvement in the interface interaction between the RDX &amp; AP particles and binder matrix."	"We demonstrate a strongly thresholded response in cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) when it is cylindrically shocked using a novel waveguide geometry. Using ultrafast single-shot multi-frame imaging, we demonstrate that &lt;100 μm diameter single crystals of RDX embedded in a polymer host deform along preferential planes for &gt;100 ns after the shock first arrives in the crystal. We use in situ imaging and time-resolved photoemission to demonstrate that short-lived chemistry occurs with complex deformation pathways. Using scanning electron microscopy and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering, we demonstrate that the shock-induced dynamics leave behind porous crystals, with pore shapes and sizes that change significantly with shock pressure. A threshold pressure of ∼12 GPa at the center of convergence separated the single-mode planar crystal deformations from the chemistry-coupled multi-plane dynamics at higher pressures. Our observations indicate preferential directions for deformation in our cylindrically shocked system, despite the applied stress along many different crystallographic planes."	"Two metal-free explosives, tetrazolo[1,5-<i>b</i>]pyridazine-containing molecules [6-azido-8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-<i>b</i>]pyridazine-7-amine (<b>3at</b>) and 8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-<i>b</i>]pyridazine-6,7-diamine (<b>6</b>)], were obtained via straightforward two-step synthetic routes from commercially available reagents. Compound <b>3at</b> displays an excellent detonation performance (<i>D</i><sub>v</sub> = 8746 m s<sup>-1</sup> and <i>P</i> = 31.5 GPa) that is superior to commercial primary explosives such as lead azide and diazodinitrophenol (DDNP). Compound <b>6</b> has superior thermal stability, remarkable insensitivity, and good detonation performance, strongly suggesting it as an acceptable secondary explosive. The initiating ability of compound <b>3at</b> has been tested by detonating 500 mg of RDX with a surprisingly low minimum primary charge of 40 mg. The extraordinary initiating power surpasses conventional primary explosives, such as commercial DDNP (70 mg) and reported 6-nitro-7-azido-pyrazol[3,4-<i>d</i>][1,2,3]triazine-2-oxide (ICM-103) (60 mg). The outstanding detonation power of <b>3at</b> contributes to its future prospects as a promising green primary explosive. In addition, the environmentally benign methodology for the synthesis of <b>3at</b> effectively shortens the time from laboratory-scale research to practical applications."	"BACKGROUND Alzheimer disease (AD) is a typical progressive and destructive neurodegenerative disease that has been studied extensively. However, genetic features and molecular mechanisms underlying AD remain unclear. Here we used bioinformatics to investigate the candidate nuclear genes involved in the molecular mechanisms of AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, we used Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to obtain the expression profiles of the mRNAs from hippocampus microarray and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) the plier algorithm. Second, functional annotation and visualization of the DEGs were conducted by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Finally, BioGRID, IntAct, STRING, and Cytoscape were utilized to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Hub genes were analytically obtained from the PPI network and the microRNA (miRNA)-target network. RESULTS Two hippocampus microarrays (GSE5281 and GSE48350) were obtained from the GEO database, comprising 161 and 253 cases separately. Among these, 118 upregulated genes and 694 downregulated genes were identified. The upregulated DEGs were mainly involved in positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, positive regulation of cartilage development, and response to wounding. The downregulated DEGs were enriched in chemical synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter secretion, and learning. By combining the results of PPI and miRNA-target network, 8 genes and 2 hub miRNAs were identified, including YWHAZ, DLG4, AGAP2, EGFR, TGFBR3, PSD3, RDX, BRWD1, and hsa-miR-106b-5p and hsa-miR-93-5p. These target genes are highly enriched in various key pathways, such as amyloid-beta formation, regulation of cardiocyte differentiation, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. CONCLUSIONS In this study, YWHAZ, DLG4, AGAP2, EGFR, TGFBR3, PSD3, RDX, and BRWD1 were identified as candidate genes for future molecular studies in AD, which is expected to improve our understanding of its cause and potential molecular mechanisms. Nuclear genes, DEGs, and related networks identified by integrated bioinformatics analysis may serve as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for AD."	"Ezrin (Ezr), radixin (Rdx) and moesin (Msn) (ERM) proteins anchor other proteins to the cell membrane, serving to regulate their localization and function. Here, we examined whether ERM proteins functionally regulate breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein in cell lines derived from lung, intestinal and renal cancers.ERM proteins were each silenced with appropriate siRNA. BCRP and P-gp functions were evaluated by means of efflux and uptake assays using 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) and rhodamine123 (Rho123) as specific substrates, respectively, in non-small cell lung cancer HCC827 cells, intestinal cancer Caco-2 cells and renal cancer Caki-1 cells.In HCC827 cells, the efflux rates of SN-38 and Rho123 were significantly decreased by knockdown of Ezr or Msn, but not Rdx. However, BCRP function was unaffected by Ezr or Rdx knockdown in Caco-2 cells, which do not express Msn. In Caki-1 cells, Rdx knockdown increased the intracellular SN-38 concentration, while knockdown of Ezr or Msn had no effect.Our findings indicate that regulation of BCRP and P-gp functions by ERM proteins is organ-specific. Thus, if the appropriate ERM protein(s) are functionally suppressed, accumulation of BCRP or P-gp substrates in lung, intestine or kidney cancer tissue might be specifically increased."	"In this work, a series of pyrazole-derived energetic compounds were successfully synthesized. These energetic compounds were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The structures of compounds 5, 6, 7 and 7a were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The physicochemical and energetic properties of all synthesized energetic compounds, including density, thermal stability and energetic performance, were investigated. The structure-property relationship was illustrated using two-dimensional fingerprint plots based on Hirshfeld surfaces, NCI plots and ESP of 7 and 7a. Among these energetic compounds, the hydroxylammonium salt 7b exhibited satisfactory calculated detonation performance (8700 m s-1), which was comparable to the commonly used highly explosive RDX (8748 m s-1). The potassium salt 5 was tested for its detonation ability by detonating RDX. The result indicates that compound 5 could be used as a potential green primary explosive."
"S1PR2"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"There is thought to be a strong relationship between sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling and pathophysiolosy of cerebral ischemia. We examined the change of expression and distribution of S1P receptors (S1PRs) and sphingosine kinases (SphKs) after cerebral ischemia in male C57BL6/J mice using immunohistochemical analysis at 1, 5, 14, and 28 days after 30 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). S1PR1, 3, and 5 were transiently induced in the cells, which were morphologically similar to neurons in the peri-infarct lesion with a peak seen at 1 day after tMCAO (p &lt; 0.01 vs. sham control). S1PR2 appeared in the inner layer of vessels in the ischemic core (p &lt; 0.01 vs. sham control) and the peri-infarct lesion (p &lt; 0.01 vs. sham control) at the acute phase after tMCAO. However, SphK1 was strongly induced at 1 and 5 days after tMCAO (p &lt; 0.01 vs. sham control) in the peri-infarct lesion, whereas SphK2 expression did not change. Western blot analysis at 1 and 5 days after 30 min of tMCAO revealed that the expression of S1PRs were transiently enhanced at the acute phase, which was consistent with the immunohistochemical results. Double immunofluorescent analysis revealed S1PR2/NG2- and S1PR2/CD31-, S1PR3/CD31-, and S1PR5/CD31-double positive cells in the peri-infarct lesion 1 day after tMCAO. The present results suggest that S1PRs and SphK1 may be important therapeutic targets for rescuing the peri-infarct lesion."	"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling lipid, synthetized by sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2), that affects cardiovascular function in various ways. S1P signaling is complex, particularly since its molecular action is reliant on the differential expression of its receptors (S1PR1, S1PR2, S1PR3, S1PR4, S1PR5) within various tissues. Significance of this sphingolipid is manifested early in vertebrate development as certain defects in S1P signaling result in embryonic lethality due to defective vasculo- or cardiogenesis. Similar in the mature organism, S1P orchestrates both physiological and pathological processes occurring in the heart and vasculature of higher eukaryotes. S1P regulates cell fate, vascular tone, endothelial function and integrity as well as lymphocyte trafficking, thus disbalance in its production and signaling has been linked with development of such pathologies as arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and aberrant angiogenesis. Number of signaling mechanisms are critical - from endothelial nitric oxide synthase through STAT3, MAPK and Akt pathways to HDL particles involved in redox and inflammatory balance. Moreover, S1P controls both acute cardiac responses (cardiac inotropy and chronotropy), as well as chronic processes (such as apoptosis and hypertrophy), hence numerous studies demonstrate significance of S1P in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic/fibrotic heart disease, myocardial infarction and heart failure. This review presents current knowledge concerning the role of S1P in the cardiovascular system, as well as potential therapeutic approaches to target S1P signaling in cardiovascular diseases."	"In vitro activation of resting ovarian follicles, with the use of mechanical stress and/or pharmacological compounds, is an emerging and novel approach for infertility treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), as a potential in vitro activation agent in murine and human ovarian tissues and isolated follicles. Juvenile murine ovaries and donated human ovarian tissues, from 10 women undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation, were incubated with or without 12 μM S1P for 3 hours for quantitative PCR analysis, and 12 hours for xenotransplantation or culture studies. Gene expression analyses were performed for genes downstream of the Hippo signaling pathway. Murine ovaries and isolated murine and human preantral follicles showed significantly increased mRNA expression levels of Ccn2/CCN2 following S1P treatment compared to controls. This increase was shown to be specific for the Hippo signaling pathway and for the S1P2 receptor, as co-treatment with Hippo-inhibitor, verteporfin, and S1PR2 antagonist, JTE-013, reduced the S1P-induced Ccn2 gene expression in murine ovaries. Histological evaluation of human cortical tissues (5x5x1 mm; n = 30; 3 pieces per patient) xenografted for 6 weeks and juvenile murine ovaries cultured for 4 days (n = 9) or allografted for 2 weeks (n = 48) showed no differences in the distribution of resting or growing follicles in S1P-treated ovarian tissues compared to controls. Collectively, S1P increased Ccn2/CCN2 gene expression in isolated preantral follicles and ovarian tissue from mice and human, but it did not promote follicle activation or growth in vivo. Thus, S1P does not appear to be a potent in vitro activation agent under these experimental conditions."	"Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is considered a potential precursor to bronchiectasis (BE) in some children. We previously showed that alveolar macrophages (AM) from children with PBB or BE have a similar significant defect in phagocytic capacity, with proinflammatory associations. We hypothesized that the mechanisms responsible for this defect involve dysregulation of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway, as we have found in adult inflammatory lung diseases.We employed a Custom TaqMan OpenArray to investigate gene expression of S1P-generating enzymes: sphingosine kinases (SPHK) 1/2, S1P phosphatase 2 (SGPP2), S1P lyase 1 (SGPL1), S1P receptors (S1PR) 1/2/4/5; proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α (TNF) and IFNγ (IFNG), the cytotoxic mediator granzyme B (GZMB), and inflammasomes AIM2 and NLRP3, in bronchoalveolar lavage from 15 children with BE, 15 with PBB and 17 age-matched controls, and determined association with clinical/demographic variables and airway inflammation.Significantly increased expression of S1PR1, S1PR2, and SPHK1 was noted in PBB and BE AM vs controls with increased SGPP2 only in PBB. TNF, IFNG, AIM2, and NLRP3 were significantly increased in both disease groups with increased GZMB only in PBB. There were no significant differences in the expression of any other S1P-related mediator between groups. There were significant positive associations between Haemophilus influenzae growth and expression of S1PR1 and NLRP3; between S1PR1 and S1PR2, NLRP3 and IFNG; between S1PR2 and AIM2, SPHK1, and SPHK2; and between SPHK1 and GZMB, IFNG, AIM2, and NLRP3.Children with PBB and BE share similar S1P-associated gene expression profiles. AM phagocytic dysfunction and inflammation in these children may occur due to dysregulated S1P signaling."	"In this study, S1PR2 was reckoned as a brand-new GPCR target for designing inhibitors to reverse 5-FU resistance. Herein a series of pyrrolidine pyrazoles as the S1PR2 inhibitors were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their activities of anti-FU-resistance. Among them, the most promising compound JTE-013, exhibited excellent inhibition on DPD expression and potent anti-FU-resistance activity in various human cancer cell lines, along with the in vivo HCT116<sup>DPD</sup> cells xenograft model, in which the inhibition rate of 5-FU was greatly increased from 13.01%-75.87%. The underlying mechanism was uncovered that JTE-013 demonstrated an anti-FU-resistance activity by blocking S1PR2 internalization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which inhibited the degradation of 5-FU into α-fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL) by downregulating tumoral DPD expression. Overall, JTE-013 could serve as the lead compound for the discovery of new anti-FU-resistance drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides novel insights that S1PR2 inhibitors could sensitize 5-FU therapy in colorectal cancer."	"Mutations in non-coding DNA regions are increasingly recognized as cancer drivers. These mutations can modify gene expression in cis or by inducing high-order chormatin structure modifications with long-range effects. Previous analysis reported the detection of recurrent and functional non-coding DNA mutations in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) genome, such as those in the 3' untranslated region of NOTCH1 and in the PAX5 super-enhancer. In this report, we used whole genome sequencing data produced by the International Cancer Genome Consortium in order to analyze regions with previously reported regulatory activity. This approach enabled the identification of numerous recurrently mutated regions that were frequently positioned in the proximity of genes involved in immune and oncogenic pathways. By correlating these mutations with expression of their nearest genes, we detected significant transcriptional changes in genes such as PHF2 and S1PR2. More research is needed to clarify the function of these mutations in CLL, particularly those found in intergenic regions."	"Bioactive sphingolipids are emerging as key regulators of vascular function and homeostasis. While most of the clinical studies have been devoted to profile circulating sphingolipids in maternal plasma, little is known about the role of the sphingolipid at the feto-placental vasculature, which is in direct contact with the offspring circulation. Our study aims to compare the sphingolipid profile of normal with preeclamptic (PE) placental chorionic arteries and isolated endothelial cells, with the goal of unveiling potential underlying pathomechanisms in the vasculature. Dihydrosphingosine and sphingomyelin (SM) concentrations (C16:0-, C18:0-, and C24:0- sphingomyelin) were significantly increased in chorionic arteries of preeclamptic placentas, whereas total ceramide, although showing a downward trend, were not statistically different. Moreover, RNA and immunofluorescence analysis showed impaired sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) synthesis and signaling in PE vessels. Our data reveal that the exposure to a deranged maternal intrauterine environment during PE alters the sphingolipid signature and gene expression on the fetal side of the placental vasculature. This pathological remodeling consists in increased serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity and SM accrual in PE chorionic arteries, with concomitance impairment endothelial S1P signaling in the endothelium of these vessels. The increase of endothelial S1P phosphatase, lyase and S1PR2, and blunted S1PR1 expression support the onset of the pathological phenotype in chorionic arteries."	"To screen the differentially expressed micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) in the serum of coronary atherosclerosis patients, and to investigate their possible mechanisms of action.The differentially expressed serum miRNAs were screened from 3 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 3 healthy controls using miRNA expression profiles, which were verified using low-throughput quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. 60 apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice were divided into model group, agomir-126 group, agomir-control (con) group, and antagomir-126 group using a random number table. They were fed with high-fat diets (21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol) ad libitum for 15 weeks to establish the mouse model of CAD. Then, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was applied to detect the impact of miR-126 expression level on the tissue morphology in the thoracic aortic region. The influences of miR-126 expression level on the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and IL-10 were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blotting assay was performed to examine the effects of miR-126 expression level on the expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VACM-1) in the tissues of the thoracic aortic region of the mice. The correlation between miR-126 expression level and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in the serum of CAD patients and animal models was analyzed by the Pearson correlation coefficient method. The targets of miR-126 were predicted using the bioinformatics method, and the direct targets were verified through investigations. Western blotting assay and ELISA were adopted to detect the impacts of miR-126 expression level on the expression and secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 in S1P + oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Lentivirus-small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was utilized to knock down the expression level of S1RP2 to determine whether miR-126 affected the increase in the inflammation level in S1P + ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by targeting S1RP2.Compared with those in control group, 4 miRNAs (miR-126, miR-206, miR-4297, and miR-3646) in the serum of CAD patients exhibited the most significant expression differences, which increased by 6.72, 7.11, 13.57, and 21.22 times, respectively. The verification results of low-throughput RT-qPCR assay indicated that there were remarkable changes in the expression levels of the 4 selected miRNAs with differential expressions in comparison with those in control group, displaying statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.01). The results of HE staining manifested that the coronary atherosclerotic plaques were reduced markedly in agomir-126 group, while notably more coronary atherosclerotic plaques were formed in the thoracic aortic region in antagomir-126 group. Meanwhile, the elevated expression level of miR-126 evidently lowered the expressions of serum TNF-α and IL-1β, but significantly increased the expression of IL-10 in the mouse model of CAD. According to the analysis results of the Pearson correlation coefficient method, the miR-126 expression level was negatively correlated with S1PR2 expression level in the serum of both CAD patients and animal models (r=-0.6123, r=-5.37). It was shown in bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter gene assay that miR-126 negatively regulated the S1PR2 expression by targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of S1PR2 messenger RNA (mRNA). In the in vitro inflammation model, the increased expression level of miR-126 could relieve the inflammation in cells induced by S1P + ox-LDL. Based on the results of both Western blotting assay and ELISA, the differences in the expression and secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10, as well as the expression levels of signaling molecules of the NF-κB signaling pathway, in the cells were not statistically significant among miR-126 mimic treatment group, sh-S1PR2 group, and miR-126 mimic + sh-S1PR2 group, indicating that miR-126 affects the inflammation level in HUVECs by targeting S1PR2.MiR-126 represses the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in the mice by binding to S1PR2. The results of this research may propose a new mechanism of miR-126 in exerting its therapeutic effects and possess potential value for the treatment of CAD in the future."	"Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) is essential for embryonic vascular development and maturation. In the adult, it is a key regulator of vascular barrier function and inflammatory processes. Its roles in tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis are not well understood. In this paper, we show that S1PR1 is expressed and active in tumor vessels. Murine tumor vessels that lack S1PR1 in the vascular endothelium (<i>S1pr1</i> ECKO) show excessive vascular sprouting and branching, decreased barrier function, and poor perfusion accompanied by loose attachment of pericytes. Compound knockout of <i>S1pr1</i>, 2, and 3 genes further exacerbated these phenotypes, suggesting compensatory function of endothelial S1PR2 and 3 in the absence of S1PR1. On the other hand, tumor vessels with high expression of S1PR1 (<i>S1pr1</i> ECTG) show less branching, tortuosity, and enhanced pericyte coverage. Larger tumors and enhanced lung metastasis were seen in <i>S1pr1</i> ECKO, whereas <i>S1pr1</i> ECTG showed smaller tumors and reduced metastasis. Furthermore, antitumor activity of a chemotherapeutic agent (doxorubicin) and immune checkpoint inhibitor blocker (anti-PD-1 antibody) were more effective in <i>S1pr1</i> ECTG than in the wild-type counterparts. These data suggest that tumor endothelial S1PR1 induces vascular normalization and influences tumor growth and metastasis, thus enhancing antitumor therapies in mouse models. Strategies to enhance S1PR1 signaling in tumor vessels may be an important adjunct to standard cancer therapy of solid tumors."	"Tumor vasculature is innately dysfunctional. Poorly functional tumor vessels inefficiently deliver chemotherapy to tumor cells; vessel hyper-permeability promotes chemotherapy delivery primarily to a tumor's periphery. Here, we identify a method for enhancing chemotherapy efficacy in Ewing sarcoma (ES) in mice by modulating tumor vessel permeability. Vessel permeability is partially controlled by the G protein-coupled Sphinosine-1-phosphate receptors 1 and 2 (S1PR1 and S1PR2) on endothelial cells. S1PR1 promotes endothelial cell junction integrity while S1PR2 destabilizes it. We hypothesize that an imbalance of S1PR1:S1PR2 is partially responsible for the dysfunctional vascular phenotype characteristic of ES and that by altering the balance in favor of S1PR1, ES vessel hyper-permeability can be reversed. In our study, we demonstrate that pharmacologic activation of S1PR1 by SEW2871 or inhibition of S1PR2 by JTE-013 caused more organized, mature and functional tumor vessels. Importantly, S1PR1 activation or S1PR2 inhibition improved antitumor efficacy. Our data suggests that pharmacologic targeting of S1PR1 and S1PR2 may be a useful adjuvant to standard chemotherapy for ES patients."	"Humoral immune responses to immunization and infection and susceptibilities to antibody-mediated autoimmunity are generally lower in males<sup>1-3</sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying such sexual dimorphism are not well understood. Here we show that there are intrinsic differences between the B cells that produce germinal centres in male and female mice. We find that antigen-activated male B cells do not position themselves as efficiently as female B cells in the centre of follicles in secondary lymphoid organs, in which germinal centres normally develop. Moreover, GPR174-an X-chromosome-encoded G-protein-coupled receptor-suppresses the formation of germinal centres in male, but not female, mice. This effect is intrinsic to B cells, and correlates with the GPR174-enhanced positioning of B cells towards the T-cell-B-cell border of follicles, and the distraction of male, but not female, B cells from S1PR2-driven follicle-centre localization. Biochemical fractionation of conditioned media that induce B-cell migration in a GPR174-dependent manner identifies CCL21 as a GPR174 ligand. In response to CCL21, GPR174 triggers a calcium flux and preferentially induces the migration of male B cells; GPR174 also becomes associated with more Gαi protein in male than in female B cells. Male B cells from orchidectomized mice exhibit impaired GPR174-mediated migration to CCL21, and testosterone treatment rescues this defect. Female B cells from testosterone-treated mice exhibit male-like GPR174-Gαi association and GPR174-mediated migration. Deleting GPR174 from male B cells causes more efficient positioning towards the follicular centre, the formation of more germinal centres and an increased susceptibility to B-cell-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. By identifying GPR174 as a receptor for CCL21 and demonstrating its sex-dependent control of B-cell positioning and participation in germinal centres, we have revealed a mechanism by which B-cell physiology is fine-tuned to impart sexual dimorphism to humoral immunity."	"In spite of the important role of Apolipoprotein-M (ApoM) and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) played in atherosclerosis (AS), there was few related research reporting ApoM and S1P complex (ApoM-S1P) on biological activities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this study, we explored the effect and mechanism of ApoM-S1P on TNF-α-induced inflammation in HUVECs.TNF-α was utilized to induce HUVEC injury and inflammation. After HUVECs were treated with antagonists of ApoM, S1P, ApoM + S1P, and ApoM + S1P + S1PR, calcein-acetoxymethyl ester was employed for the assessment of the adhesion of HUVECs to THP-1, immunofluorescence for the observation of caspase-1expression in HUVECs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) kit for the detection of ROS level in HUVECs. The impact of TNF-α, ApoM, S1P and S1PR antagonists on inflammatory response, pyroptosis and adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to HUVECs were determined by detecting expressions of pyroptosis related proteins (IL-1β, IL-18, ASC, NLRP3 and caspase-1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10), adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1) and p-PI3K/p-AKT by qRT-PCR and Western blot, as well as by ELISA.TNF-α could increase adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to HUVECs and induce inflammatory response and pyroptosis in HUVECs, indicated by up-regulated expressions of E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, and IL-6, and down-regulated expression of IL-10. Co-treatment of ApoM-S1P on TNF-α treated HUVECs could protect HUVECs from injury and inflammation, evidenced by the attenuation of expressions of pyroptosis related proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and adhesion molecules, as well as the augment of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation. JTE-013, an antagonist of S1PR2, could reverse the amelioration of ApoM-S1P on pyroptosis and inflammation of HUVECs, indicating that ApoM-S1P could bind to S1PR2 to protect HUVECs from injury and inflammation through activating PI3K/AKT pathway.ApoM-S1P could attenuate TNF-α induced injury and inflammatory response in HUVECs by binding to S1PR2 to activate PI3K/AKT pathway."	"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an essential lipid metabolite that signals through a family of five G protein-coupled receptors, S1PR1-S1PR5, to regulate cell physiology. The multiple sclerosis drug Fingolimod (FTY720) is a potent S1P receptor agonist that causes peripheral lymphopenia. Recent research has demonstrated direct neuroprotective properties of FTY720 in several neurodegenerative paradigms; however, neuroprotective properties of the native ligand S1P have not been established. We aimed to establish the significance of neurotrophic factor up-regulation by S1P for neuroprotection, comparing S1P with FTY720. S1P induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) gene expression in primary human and murine astrocytes, but not in neurons, and to a much greater extent than FTY720. Accordingly, S1P but not FTY720 protected cultured neurons against excitotoxic cell death in a primary murine neuron-glia coculture model, and a neutralizing antibody to LIF blocked this S1P-mediated neuroprotection. Antagonists of S1PR1 and S1PR2 both inhibited S1P-mediated neurotrophic gene induction in human astrocytes, indicating that simultaneous activation of both receptors is required. S1PR2 signaling was transduced through Gα<sub>13</sub> and the small GTPase Rho, and was necessary for the up-regulation and activation of the transcription factors FOS and JUN, which regulate LIF, BDNF, and HBEGF transcription. In summary, we show that S1P protects hippocampal neurons against excitotoxic cell death through up-regulation of neurotrophic gene expression, particularly LIF, in astrocytes. This up-regulation requires both S1PR1 and S1PR2 signaling. FTY720 does not activate S1PR2, explaining its relative inefficacy compared to S1P."	"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is very aggressive with high metastatic and mortality rates and unfortunately, except for chemotherapy, there are few therapeutic options. The bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) regulates numerous processes important for cancer progression, metastasis, and neuropathic pain. The pro-drug FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya) used to treat multiple sclerosis is phosphorylated in the body to a S1P mimic that binds to S1PRs, except S1PR2, and also acts as a functional antagonist of S1PR1. This review highlights current findings showing that FTY720 has multiple anti-cancer activities and simultaneously prevents formation and actions of S1P. Moreover, in mouse breast cancer models, treatment with FTY720 reduces tumor growth, metastasis, and enhances sensitivity of advanced and hormonal refractory breast cancer and TNBC to conventional therapies. We discuss recent studies demonstrating that neuropathic pain induced by the chemotherapeutic bortezomib is also greatly reduced by administration of clinically relevant doses of FTY720, likely by targeting S1PR1 on astrocytes. FTY720 also shows promising anticancer potential in pre-clinical studies and is FDA approved, thus we suggest in this review that further studies are needed to pave the way for fast-tracking approval of FTY720/fingolimod for enhancing chemotherapy effectiveness and reduction of painful neuropathies."	"To observe the expressions of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in hippocampus of epileptic rats and to investigate the pathogenesis of SphK1 and S1PR2 in epilepsy.One hundred and eight male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control group (n=48) and pilocarpine (PILO) group (n=60). A robust convulsive status epilepticus (SE) was induced in PILO group rats by the application of pilocarpine. Control group rats were injected with respective of physiological saline. Pilocarpine group was randomly divided into 6 subgroups (n=8): acute group (E6 h, E1 d, E3 d), latent group (E7 d) and chronic group (E30 d, E56 d). Each subgroup has 8 control rats and 8 epileptic rats. Hippocampal tissue and brain slices were obtained from control rats and rats subjected to the Li-PILO model of epilepsy at 6 h, 1 d, 3 d,7 d,30 d and 56 d after status epilepticus (SE). Western blot technique was used to determine the expressions of SphK1 and S1PR2 in hippocampus at different point of time after pilocarpine treatment. Immunofluorescence was applied to detect the activation and proliferation of hippocampal astrocytes and the localization of SphK1 and S1PR2 in rat hippocampal astrocytes.Compared with control group, the levels of SphK1 in acute phase (E3 d), latent phase (E7 d) and chronic phase (E30 d, E56 d) were significantly increased while the expressions of S1PR2 were decreased in acute phase (E3 d), latent phase (E7 d) and chronic phase (E30 d, E56 d)(P＜0.05 or P＜0.01). Immunofluorescence results showed astrocyte activation and proliferation in hippocampus of epileptic (E7 d) rats (P＜0.05). Confocal microscopy confirmed the preferential expressions of SphK1 and S1PR2 in epileptic rat(E7 d)hippocampal astrocytes.The results indicate that SphK1 and S1PR2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy by regulating the activation and proliferation of hippocampal astrocytes and altering neuronal excitability."	"The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor S1PR2 and its downstream adaptor Gα13 are recurrently mutationally inactivated in the germinal center B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and are silenced by the S1PR2 repressor FOXP1 in the activated B-cell like subtype of the disease. Loss of S1PR2 signaling relieves the germinal center confinement that is maintained by an S1P gradient and allows cells to resist S1P-induced apoptosis. We have shown previously that S1PR2 expression is induced in normal B cells through a newly described transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/TGF-βRII/SMAD1 signaling axis that is inactivated in &gt;85% of DLBCL patients. DLBCL cell lines lacking S1PR2, TGFBRII, or SMAD1 as the result of genomic editing all have a strong growth advantage in vitro, as well as in subcutaneous and orthotopic xenotransplantation models. Here, we show that the TGF-β signaling pathway in DLBCL is blocked at the level of SMAD1 in DLBCL cell lines and patient samples by hypermethylation of CpG-rich regions surrounding the SMAD1 transcription start site. The pharmacologic restoration of SMAD1 expression by the demethylating agent decitabine (DAC) sensitizes cells to TGF-β-induced apoptosis and reverses the growth of initially SMAD1- cell lines in ectopic and orthotopic models. This effect of DAC is reduced in a SMAD1-knockout cell line. We further show that DAC restores SMAD1 expression and reduces the tumor burden in a novel patient-derived orthotopic xenograft model. The combined data lend further support to the concept of an altered epigenome as a major driver of DLBCL pathogenesis."	"Precisely controlling the excitatory and inhibitory balance is crucial for the stability and information-processing ability of neuronal networks. However, the molecular mechanisms maintaining this balance during ongoing sensory experiences are largely unclear. We show that Nogo-A signaling reciprocally regulates excitatory and inhibitory transmission. Loss of function for Nogo-A signaling through S1PR2 rapidly increases GABA<sub>A</sub>R diffusion, thereby decreasing their number at synaptic sites and the amplitude of GABAergic mIPSCs at CA3 hippocampal neurons. This increase in GABA<sub>A</sub>R diffusion rate is correlated with an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and requires the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of the γ2 subunit at serine 327. These results suggest that Nogo-A signaling rapidly strengthens inhibitory GABAergic transmission by restricting the diffusion dynamics of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Together with the observation that Nogo-A signaling regulates excitatory transmission in an opposite manner, these results suggest a crucial role for Nogo-A signaling in modulating the excitation and inhibition balance to restrict synaptic plasticity."	"Of all the novel glucoregulatory molecules discovered in the past 20 years, bile acids (BAs) are notable for the fact that they were hiding in plain sight. BAs were well known for their requirement in dietary lipid absorption and biliary cholesterol secretion, due to their micelle-forming properties. However, it was not until 1999 that BAs were discovered to be endogenous ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR. Since that time, BAs have been shown to act through multiple receptors (PXR, VDR, TGR5 and S1PR2), as well as to have receptor-independent mechanisms (membrane dynamics, allosteric modulation of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D). We now also have an appreciation of the range of physiological, pathophysiological and therapeutic conditions in which endogenous BAs are altered, raising the possibility that BAs contribute to the effects of these conditions on glycaemia. In this Review, we highlight the mechanisms by which BAs regulate glucose homeostasis and the settings in which endogenous BAs are altered, and provide suggestions for future research."	"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complication in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) that severely affects the patients' quality of life. However, the effectiveness of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in these patients is poor. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) are important factors regulating the Rho-kinase pathway, and understanding these factors may provide ideas for new therapeutic strategies for ED.To investigate whether the S1PR2 receptor antagonist JTE-013 could improve DM-induced ED (DMED) in rats and to explore the potential mechanisms.We used 50 male Sprague Dawley rats (8 weeks old) for this experiment. Type Ⅰ DM was induced in forty-two rats via streptozotocin administration; the rest of the rats served as controls. Eight weeks after DM induction, rats with ED were selected via an apomorphine test. Eight of them were injected intraperitoneally with JTE-013 each day for 4 weeks. The rest were fed under the same conditions for 4 weeks. Erectile function was measured by cavernous nerve electrostimulation. The expression levels of related signaling pathways were evaluated using Western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry.Erectile function was significantly impaired in the DMED group compared with the control group and was partially improved in the DMED + JTE-013 group. The expression of S1PR2 and the activity of the RhoA/ROCK/phospho-myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (p-MYPT1) pathway proteins were higher in the DMED group than in the other two groups, and JTE-013 treatment significantly reduced the expression/activity of these proteins. Furthermore, the DMED group showed severe corporal fibrosis, a higher apoptotic index and increased activity in the TGF-β1/LIMK2/Cofilin pathway compared with the control group. JTE-013 supplementation significantly ameliorated these pathological changes.JTE-013 supplementation partially improved erectile function in rats with DMED, likely by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction, corporal fibrosis, and apoptosis."	"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been reported to enhance the function of islet β-cells, providing a potential therapeutic target for diabetes mellitus. In the present study, the effects of S1P on the proliferation and apoptosis of β-cells in type 2 diabetic mice were investigated. The mice were administered intraperitoneal S1P solution daily at a dose of 20 µg/kg for three weeks. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index determination were carried out. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the protein expression of insulin, antigen Ki-67 and S1P receptor isoforms (S1PR1/S1PR2/S1PR3) in pancreatic islets. Compared with the diabetic control (DC) group, the IPGTT results and HOMA-IR index in the S1P treatment group were decreased. The islets in the S1P group exhibited higher insulin immunostaining intensity than the DC group, as well as higher proliferation (P&lt;0.05) and lower apoptosis rates (P&lt;0.05). Positive staining for the S1P receptors S1PR1, S1PR2 and S1PR3 was observed in the cytoplasm and membrane of the islet cells. S1PR1 and S1PR2 proteins showed increased expression in the S1P and DC groups compared with the normal control group (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05, respectively), whereas no significant difference was observed in the expression of S1PR3 among these groups. In conclusion, extracellular S1P can induce islet β-cell proliferation and decrease cell apoptosis in diabetic mice. S1P function may be mediated via S1PR1 and S1PR2; therefore, targeting S1P/S1PR signalling pathways may be a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes mellitus."
"STRC"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Timely diagnosis and identification of etiology of pediatric mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) are both medically and socioeconomically important. However, the exact etiologic spectrum remains uncertain. We aimed to establish a genetic etiological spectrum, including copy-number variations (CNVs) and efficient genetic testing pipeline, of this defect.A cohort of prospectively recruited pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate nonsyndromic SNHL from 2014 through 2018 (n = 110) was established. Exome sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and nested customized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for exclusion of a pseudogene, STRCP, from a subset (n = 83) of the cohort, were performed. Semen analysis was also performed to determine infertility (n = 2).Genetic etiology was confirmed in nearly two-thirds (52/83 = 62.7%) of subjects, with STRC-related deafness (n = 29, 34.9%) being the most prevalent, followed by MPZL2-related deafness (n = 9, 10.8%). This strikingly high proportion of Mendelian genetic contribution was due particularly to the frequent detection of CNVs involving STRC in one-third (27/83) of our subjects. We also questioned the association of homozygous continuous gene deletion of STRC and CATSPER2 with deafness-infertility syndrome (MIM61102).Approximately two-thirds of sporadic pediatric mild-to-moderate SNHL have a clear Mendelian genetic etiology, and one-third is associated with CNVs involving STRC. Based on this, we propose a new guideline for molecular diagnosis of these children."	"In this study, nanofibrous scaffolds were prepared from polyurethane and cellulose acetate using electrospinning. Reduced graphene oxide/silver nanocomposites, rGO/Ag, were also used into the mats due to the strong antibacterial activity of rGO/Ag nanocomposites. In order to prevent the agglomeration of silver nanoparticles, AgNPs, the nanoparticles were decorated onto the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets. Initially, Graphene oxide, briefly GO, was synthesized by the improved Hummer method. Then, nanocomposites of reduced graphene oxide were decorated with Ag and were fabricated via a green and facile hydrothermal method. Thereafter, the scaffold containing rGO/Ag nanocomposites, curcumin or both of them were prepared using the electrospinning method. The obtained scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle, tensile analysis, porosity, and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR). 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, MTT, confirmed the biocompatibility of the composite nanofibers. The scaffolds were able to hinder both of the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through direct contact with them. In vivo histopathological studies indicated that the scaffold incorporated rGO/Ag nanocomposites and curcumin has the most effect on wound healing and can promote the healing rate of artificial wounds, which indicates the good biomedical potential of nanomaterial in wound healing."	"Exome sequencing (ES) is a first-tier diagnostic test for many suspected Mendelian disorders. While it is routine to detect small sequence variants, it is not a standard practice in clinical settings to detect germline copy-number variants (CNVs) from ES data due to several reasons relating to performance. In this work, we comprehensively characterized one of the most sensitive ES-based CNV tools, ExomeDepth, against SNP array, a standard of care test in clinical settings to detect genome-wide CNVs.We propose a modified ExomeDepth workflow by excluding exons with low mappability prior to variant calling to drastically reduce the false positives originating from the repetitive regions of the genome, and an iterative variant calling framework to assess the reproducibility. We used a cohort of 307 individuals with clinical ES data and clinical SNP array to estimate the sensitivity and false discovery rate of the CNV detection using exome sequencing. Further, we performed targeted testing of the STRC gene in 1972 individuals. To reduce the number of variants for downstream analysis, we performed a large-scale iterative variant calling process with random control cohorts to assess the reproducibility of the CNVs.The modified workflow presented in this paper reduced the number of total variants identified by one third while retaining a higher sensitivity of 97% and resulted in an improved false discovery rate of 11.4% compared to the default ExomeDepth pipeline. The exclusion of exons with low mappability removes 4.5% of the exons, including a subset of exons (0.6%) in disease-associated genes which are intractable by short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS). Results from the reproducibility analysis showed that the clinically reported variants were reproducible 100% of the time and that the modified workflow can be used to rank variants from high to low confidence. Targeted testing of 30 CNVs identified in STRC, a challenging gene to ascertain by NGS, showed a 100% validation rate.In summary, we introduced a modification to the default ExomeDepth workflow to reduce the false positives originating from the repetitive regions of the genome, created a large-scale iterative variant calling framework for reproducibility, and provided recommendations for implementation in clinical settings."	"Recessive mutations in GJB2 is the most common cause of genetic hearing loss worldwide. The aim of this study is to determine the spectrum and frequency of GJB2 variants in Chinese Han deaf patients and to investigate the underlying causative genes in patients with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.We analyzed the mutation screening results of GJB2 in 1852 Chinese Han probands with apparently autosomal-recessive hearing loss in our laboratory. Targeted next-generation sequencing of 139 known deafness-related genes were performed in 44 probands with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.Bi-allelic GJB2 mutations was identified in 25.65% of patients, in which the c.235delC (p.L79Cfs*3) mutation is the most frequent cause for both severe-to-profound (84.93%) and mild-to-moderate hearing loss (54.05%), while the c.109G &gt; A (p.V37I) mutation is another frequent cause for mild-to-moderate hearing loss (40.54%). In 3.89% of patients only one mutant allele can be identified in GJB2. Targeted next generation sequencing in 44 such probands revealed digenic heterozygous mutations in GJB2/GJB6 and GJB2/GJB3 as the likely pathogenic mechanism in three probands. In 13 probands, on the other hand, pathogenic mutations in other deafness-associated genes (STRC, EYA1, MITF, PCDH15, USH2A, MYO15A, CDH23, OTOF, SLC26A4, SMPX, and TIMM8A) can be identified as the independent genetic cause, suggesting that the mono-allelic GJB2 mutations in those probands is likely co-incidental.Our results demonstrated that GJB2 should be a primary target for mutation screening in Chinese Han deaf patients, and those with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations should be further screened by next generation sequencing."	"To determine the prevalence of children with genetic hearing loss who are cytomegalovirus (CMV) positive at birth and the relative proportion of genetic and CMV etiology among children with congenital bilateral hearing loss.Database review.We performed a review of clinical test results for patients undergoing comprehensive genetic testing for all known hearing loss-associated genes from January 2012 to January 2019. This population was reviewed for reported CMV status and genetic causes of congenital bilateral hearing loss.In the OtoSCOPE database, 61/4,282 patients were found to have a documented CMV status, and 661/4282 had documented bilateral congenital hearing loss. Two patients were identified who had both a positive CMV result and a genetic cause for their hearing loss. Forty-eight percent of patients with bilateral congenital hearing loss (320/661) were found to have a genetic etiology. In 62% (198/320), the hearing loss was associated with pathogenic variants in GJB2, STRC, SLC26A4 or an Usher syndrome-associated gene.We estimate that ~2% of CMV-positive newborns with hearing loss have a known genetic variant as a cause. The subcohort of CMV-positive newborns with symmetric mild-to-moderate bilateral hearing loss will have at least a 7% chance of having pathogenic gene variants associated with hearing loss. In a CMV-positive neonate who failed their newborn hearing screen bilaterally, genetic screening needs to be considered for accurate diagnosis and possible deferment of antiviral treatment.4 Laryngoscope, 2020."	"Chemotherapy objective response rates (ORRs) in metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are typically 20-40% with median progression-free survival (PFS) less than 6 months. Lurbinectedin is a new anticancer agent under investigation. The primary objective of this three-arm, phase II study was to determine the disease control rate (DCR = ORR + stable disease [SD]) at 24 weeks of lurbinectedin alone or with chemotherapy in STS. Eligible patients included adults with ≤2 prior cytotoxic therapies. Study cohorts were: stratum A (StrA; anthracycline-naive), lurbinectedin/doxorubicin; stratum B (StrB; prior anthracycline), lurbinectedin/gemcitabine; stratum C (StrC; prior anthracycline/gemcitabine) lurbinectedin monotherapy. Each stratum was analysed separately by Simon two-stage design. Forty-two patients were accrued (StrA = 20, StrB = 10, StrC = 12) including leiomyosarcoma [LMS] (n = 20), synovial sarcoma [SS](n = 4), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (n = 3) and other STS histologies (n = 15). For StrA there were seven partial responses (PR) plus one stable disease (SD) at 24 weeks. For StrB, two patients met the 24-week DCR including one PR (leiomyosarcoma) and one SD (desmoplastic small round cell tumour [DSRCT]). StrB did not continue to the second stage. In StrC, no patients met the primary end-point. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was: StrA = 4.2 months (90% CI 1.4-7.8), StrB = 1.7 months (90% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-7.4), and StrC = 1.3 months (90% CI 1.1-3.0). Lurbinectedin as a single agent or with chemotherapy was well tolerated with haematologic adverse events (AE's) as the most common toxicity. There were no treatment-related deaths. The combination of lurbinectedin/doxorubicin reached the DCR end-point with seven PR and one patient with SD (ORR 35.0%, 24-week DCR 40.0%). Evidence of drug benefit was seen in leiomyosarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS), myxoid liposarcoma (MLS), synovial sarcoma (SS), and desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSRCT). TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02448537."	"The specific association of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) or early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (LCA-like) with sensorineural hearing loss (SHL) is uncommon. Recently, we ascribed some of these distinctive associations to dominant and de novo mutations in the β-tubulin 4B isotype-encoding gene (TUBB4B), providing a link between a sensorineural disease and anomalies in microtubules behavior. Here, we report 12 sporadic cases with LCA/SHL or LCA-like/SHL and no TUBB4B mutation. Trio-based whole exome sequencing (WES) identified disease-causing mutations in 5/12 cases. Four out of five carried biallelic mutations in PEX1 (1/4) or PEX6 (3/4), involved in peroxisome biogenesis disorders from Zellweger syndrome characterized by severe neurologic and neurosensory dysfunctions, craniofacial abnormalities, and liver dysfunction to Heimler syndrome associating SHL, enamel hypoplasia of the secondary dentition, nail abnormalities, and occasional retinal disease. Upon reexamination, the index case carrying PEX1 mutations, a 4-year-old girl, presented additional symptoms consistent with Zellweger syndrome. Reexamination of individuals with PEX6 mutations (1/3 unavailable) revealed normal nails but enamel hypoplasia affecting one primary teeth in a 4-year-old girl and severe enamel hypoplasia of primary teeth hidden by dental prosthesis in a 50-year-old male, describing a novel PEX6-associated disease of the Zellweger/Heimler spectrum. Finally, hemizygosity for a CACNA1F mutation was identified in an 18-year-old male addressed for LCA/SHL, redirecting the retinal diagnosis to congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A). Consistent with the pure CSNB2A retinal involvement, SHL was ascribed to biallelic mutations in another gene, STRC, involved in nonprogressive DFNB16 deafness."	"The function of outer hair cells (OHCs), the mechanical actuators of the cochlea, involves the anchoring of their tallest stereocilia in the tectorial membrane (TM), an acellular structure overlying the sensory epithelium. Otogelin and otogelin-like are TM proteins related to secreted epithelial mucins. Defects in either cause the DFNB18B and DFNB84B genetic forms of deafness, respectively, both characterized by congenital mild-to-moderate hearing impairment. We show here that mutant mice lacking otogelin or otogelin-like have a marked OHC dysfunction, with almost no acoustic distortion products despite the persistence of some mechanoelectrical transduction. In both mutants, these cells lack the horizontal top connectors, which are fibrous links joining adjacent stereocilia, and the TM-attachment crowns coupling the tallest stereocilia to the TM. These defects are consistent with the previously unrecognized presence of otogelin and otogelin-like in the OHC hair bundle. The defective hair bundle cohesiveness and the absence of stereociliary imprints in the TM observed in these mice have also been observed in mutant mice lacking stereocilin, a model of the DFNB16 genetic form of deafness, also characterized by congenital mild-to-moderate hearing impairment. We show that the localizations of stereocilin, otogelin, and otogelin-like in the hair bundle are interdependent, indicating that these proteins interact to form the horizontal top connectors and the TM-attachment crowns. We therefore suggest that these 2 OHC-specific structures have shared mechanical properties mediating reaction forces to sound-induced shearing motion and contributing to the coordinated displacement of stereocilia."	"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNL) is the most prevalent sensory deficit in our environment. Next generation genomic sequencing (NGS) enables an aetiological diagnosis in a high percentage of patients. Our pilot study shows the results of the systematic application of NGS in a Childhood Hearing Loss Unit, as well as its implications for the clinical management of patients and their families.We included 27 patients diagnosed with SNL between 2014 and 2017, in which an environmental cause was ruled out. The genetic test consisted of a panel of genes analyzed by NGS (OTOgenicsTM panel). This panel has been designed to include genes associated with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss, early onset or late, syndromic and non-syndromic, regardless of their inheritance pattern.A genetic diagnosis was obtained in 56% (15/27) of the patients (62% in the case of bilateral SNL). Of the patients, 5/27 (19%) presented pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene and the rest pathogenic and / or probably pathogenic variants in other genes associated with isolated SNL (PR2X2, TECTA and STRC), with syndromic SNL (CHD7, GATA3, COL4A5, MITF and SOX10) or with syndromic and non-syndromic SNL (BSND, ACTG1 and CDH23).The aetiological diagnosis of SNL is a challenge in clinical practice. Our series demonstrates that it is possible to implement genetic diagnosis in the care routine and that this information has prognostic and therapeutic implications."	"Copy number variations (CNVs) are commonly reported in <i>STRC</i>, the causal gene for DFNB16. Various techniques are used clinically for CNV detection, and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) provides highly precise absolute quantification of DNA copy number. We aimed to validate the feasibility and efficiency of ddPCR in combination with long-range PCR (LR-PCR) in identifying CNVs and mutations in <i>STRC</i>. Additionally, we determined the frequency of CNVs and mutations in <i>STRC</i> in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. We evaluated 84 unrelated Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate bilateral idiopathic or autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The ratio of <i>STRC</i> copy number to the copy number of the internal control <i>RPP30</i> ranged from 0.949 to 1.009 (0.989 ± 0.017) in 77 patients; it ranged from 0.484 to 0.538 (0.509 ± 0.024) in five patients and was 0.000 in two patients, indicating heterozygous and homozygous deletions, respectively. The copy number deletion prevalence rates were 7.7% and 0.9% in the patients and healthy controls, respectively. In combination with LR-PCR, ddPCR revealed that at least three patients (3.6%) had <i>STRC</i>-related hearing loss. Detecting <i>STRC</i> CNVs by ddPCR was rapid, precise, and cost-effective and facilitated the identification of <i>STRC</i> CNVs."	"Hearing loss is the most frequent sensory disorder and is genetically extremely heterogeneous. By far the most frequent cause of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss (AR-NSHL) are biallelic pathogenic mutations in the GJB2 gene causing DFNB1. The worldwide search for the second most common type of AR-NSHL took almost two decades. Recently reported alterations (mostly deletions) of the STRC gene, also named DFNB16, seem to be the second most frequent cause of AR-NSHL. Genetic testing of STRC is very challenging due to the highly homologous pseudogene. Anecdotal evidence from single patients shows that STRC mutations have their typical audiological findings and patients usually have moderate hearing loss. The aim of this study is to discover if audiological findings in patients with biallelic pathogenic mutations affecting STRC have the characteristic features and shape of audiological curves and if there are genotype/phenotype correlations in relation to various types of STRC mutations.Eleven hearing loss patients with pathogenic mutations on both alleles of the STRC gene were detected during routine genetic examination of AR-NSHL patients. Audiological examination consisted of pure tone audiometry, stapedial reflexes, tympanometry and otoacoustic emission tests.The threshold of pure tone average (PTA) was 46 dB and otoacoustic emissions were not detectable in these DFNB16 patients. All patients were without vestibular irritation or asymmetry.Moderate sensorineural hearing loss is typical for DFNB16-associated hearing loss and there are no significant differences in audiological phenotypes among different types of mutations affecting STRC."	"We tested the hypothesis that acute, non-metabolic fatigue, by reducing maximal power output and possibly increasing muscle recruitment at a given exercise intensity, will reduce indexes of exercise tolerance during incremental cycling. Ten subjects performed three ramp incremental tests respectively after static stretching (STRC), dropjumps (DJ) or control (CTRL). Fatigue was assessed as reduction in maximal power output (<sub>sprint</sub>PO) during isokinetic sprints. During the ramps we measured: oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), power output (PO), and surface electromyography. <sub>sprint</sub>PO was reduced after STRC and DJ (p = 0.007) yet not after CTRL. During the ramps, the interventions augmented muscle excitation vs CTRL (p ≤ 0.001). Peak PO and VO<sub>2</sub> were reduced after STRC (302 ± 39W p = 0.033, 3365 ± 465 ml/min p = 0.015) and DJ (300 ± 37W p = 0.023, 3413 ± 476 ml/min p = 0.094) vs CTRL (314 ± 41W, 3505 ± 486 ml/min). Interventions were associated with early occurrence of the ventilatory thresholds and increased VO<sub>2</sub> vs CTRL (p = 0.029). The physiological response after acute non-metabolic fatigue suggests a link between exercise intolerance and the decreased ability to produce force."	"The intestinal epithelium undergoes constant regeneration driven by intestinal stem cells. How old age affects the transcriptome in this highly dynamic tissue is an important, but poorly explored question. Using transcriptomics on sorted intestinal stem cells and adult enterocytes, we identified candidate genes, which change expression on aging. Further validation of these on intestinal epithelium of multiple middle-aged versus old-aged mice highlighted the consistent up-regulation of the expression of the gene encoding chemokine receptor Ccr2, a mediator of inflammation and several disease processes. We observed also increased expression of Strc, coding for stereocilin, and dramatically decreased expression of Rps4l, coding for a ribosome subunit. Ccr2 and Rps4l are located close to the telomeric regions of chromosome 9 and 6, respectively. As only few genes were differentially expressed and we did not observe significant protein level changes of identified ageing markers, our analysis highlights the overall robustness of murine intestinal epithelium gene expression to old age."	"Here, we report the prenatal detection of a compound heterozygous deletion at chromosome 15q15.3 by clinical chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing that included the CATSPER2 male infertility gene. However, given the low resolution of CMA at this homologous locus, it was unclear if the neighboring STRC hearing loss gene was also affected. Therefore, we developed a novel allele-specific PCR strategy, which narrowed the proximal breakpoint of the maternally inherited deletion to a 310 bp interval that was 440 bp upstream from the STRC transcription start site."	"Literature review of the genetic etiology of hearing loss (HL) in the African American (AA) population.PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL were accessed from 1966 to 2018.PRISMA guidelines were followed. Search terms included permutations of &quot;hearing loss,&quot; &quot;African American,&quot; &quot;black,&quot; and &quot;genetic&quot;; &quot;African American&quot; was then cross-referenced against documented HL genes. AA subjects included in multiethnic cohorts of genetic HL testing were identified by searching the key terms &quot;hearing loss&quot; and &quot;ethnic cohort&quot; and &quot;genetic.&quot; The Q-Genie tool was used in the quality assessment of included studies. An allele frequency meta-analysis of pathogenic GJB2 variants in the AA population was performed and stratified by hearing status.Four hundred seventeen articles were reviewed, and 26 met our inclusion criteria. Ten studies were included in the GJB2 meta-analysis. In the general AA population, pathogenic GJB2 variants are rare, including the 35delG allele, which displayed a carrier frequency of 0.05%. Pathogenic variants were discovered in seven nonsyndromic HL genes (GJB2, MYO3A, TECTA, STRC, OTOF, MYH14, TMC1), eight syndromic HL genes, and one mitochondrial HL gene. Recent comprehensive genetic testing using custom genetic HL testing platforms has yielded only a 26% molecular diagnosis rate for HL etiologies in the AA population.Investigators should be encouraged to provide an ethnic breakdown of results. Sparse literature and poor diagnosis rates indicate that genes involved in HL in the AA population have yet to be identified. Future explorative investigations using next-generation sequencing technologies, such as whole-exome sequencing, into the AA population are warranted."	"Although poly vinyl alcohol-poly acrylic acid (PVA-PAA) composites have been widely used for biomedical applications, their incorporation into double-layer assembled thin films has been limited because the interfacial binding materials negatively influence the water uptake capacity of PVA. To minimize the effect of interfacial binding, a simple method for the fabrication of a double-layered PVA-PAA hydrogel was introduced, and its biomedical properties were evaluated in this study. Our results revealed that the addition of PAA layers on the surface of PVA significantly increased the swelling properties. Compared to PVA, the equilibrium swelling ratio of the PVA-PAA hydrogel increased (<i>p</i> = 0.035) and its water vapour permeability significantly decreased (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Statistical analysis revealed that an increase in pH value from 7 to 10 as well as the addition of PAA at pH = 7 significantly increased the adhesion force (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.04). The mechanical properties-including ultimate tensile strength, modulus, and elongation at break-remained approximately untouched compared to PVA. A significant increase in biocompatibility was found after day 7 (<i>p</i> = 0.016). A higher release rate for tetracycline was found at pH = 8 compared to neutral pH."	"Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) is a relatively rare metabolic disease with variable clinical intensity. It is caused by deficient activity of the glucose 6-phosphatase enzyme (GSD Ia) or a deficiency in the microsomal transport proteins for glucose 6-phosphate (GSD Ib). We searched the most recent English literature (1997-2017) regarding any article with the key word of &quot;glycogen storage disease type I&quot; in PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. We will present all of the published articles about the molecular genetic characteristics and old-to-new diagnostic methods used to identify GSD I in regard of methodology, advantages and disadvantages. Diagnosis of GSD type I and its variants is challenging because it is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Many molecular methods have been used to diagnose GSD I most of which have been based on mutation detection. Therefore, we discuss complete aspects of all of the molecular diagnostic tests, which have been used in GSD type I so far. With the advent of high throughput advanced molecular tests, molecular diagnosis is going to be an important platform for the diagnosis of storage and metabolic diseases such as GSD type I. Next-generation sequencing, in combination with the biochemical tests and clinical signs and symptoms create an accurate, reliable and feasible method. It can overcome the difficulties by the diagnosis of diseases with broad clinical and genetic heterogeneity."	"Large-scale population analyses coupled with advances in technology have demonstrated that the human genome is more diverse than originally thought. To date, this diversity has largely been uncovered using short-read whole-genome sequencing. However, these short-read approaches fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify structural events, cannot access repetitive regions, and fail to resolve the human genome into haplotypes. Here, we describe an approach that retains long range information while maintaining the advantages of short reads. Starting from ∼1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, we produce barcoded short-read libraries. Novel informatic approaches allow for the barcoded short reads to be associated with their original long molecules producing a novel data type known as &quot;Linked-Reads&quot;. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single library. In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short-read approaches for reference-based analysis. Linked-Reads allow mapping to 38 Mb of sequence not accessible to short reads, adding sequence in 423 difficult-to-sequence genes including disease-relevant genes <i>STRC</i>, <i>SMN1</i>, and <i>SMN2</i> Both Linked-Read whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing identify complex structural variations, including balanced events and single exon deletions and duplications. Further, Linked-Reads extend the region of high-confidence calls by 68.9 Mb. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone."	"Sensorineural hearing loss is a common deficit and mainly occurs due to genetic factors. Recently, copy number variants (CNVs) in the STRC gene have also been recognized as a major cause of genetic hearing loss. We investigated the frequency of STRC deletions in the Japanese population and the characteristics of associated hearing loss. For CNV analysis, we employed a specialized method of Ion AmpliSeq<sup>TM</sup> sequencing, and confirmed the CNV results via custom array comparative genomic hybridization. We identified 17 probands with STRC homozygous deletions. The prevalence of STRC homozygous deletions was 1.7% in the hearing loss population overall, and 4.3% among mild-to-moderate hearing loss patients. A 2.63% carrier deletion rate was identified in both the hearing loss and the control population with normal hearing. In conclusion, our results show that STRC deletions are the second most common cause of mild-to-moderate hearing loss after the GJB2 gene, which accounts for the majority of genetic hearing loss. The phenotype of hearing loss is congenital and appears to be moderate, and is most likely to be stable without deterioration even after the age of 50. The present study highlights the importance of the STRC gene as a major cause of mild-to-moderate hearing loss."	"Outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia bundle deflection opens mechanoelectrical transduction channels at the tips of the stereocilia from the middle and short rows, while bundle cohesion is maintained owing to the presence of horizontal top connectors. Here, we used a quantitative noncontact atomic force microscopy method to investigate stereocilia bundle stiffness and damping, when stimulated at acoustic frequencies and nanometer distances from the bundle. Stereocilia bundle mechanics were determined in stereocilin-deficient mice lacking top connectors and with detached tectorial membrane (<i>Strc</i><sup>-/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup> double knockout) and heterozygous littermate controls (<i>Strc</i><sup>+/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup>). A substantial decrease in bundle stiffness and damping by ~60 and ~74% on postnatal days P13 to P15 was observed when top connectors were absent. Additionally, we followed bundle mechanics during OHC top connectors development between P9 and P15 and quantified the observed increase in OHC bundle stiffness and damping in <i>Strc</i><sup>+/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice while no significant change was detected in <i>Strc</i><sup>-/-</sup>/<i>Tecta</i><sup>-/-</sup> animals."
"TMIE"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is an aggressive disease owing to early and widespread lymph node metastases. Multimodal therapy and radical surgery may improve prognosis. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of radical lymph node and thoracic duct resection.Patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent transthoracic minimally invasive oesophagectomy (TMIE) for cancer at Keio University Hospital between January 2004 and December 2016 were selected. Between 2004 and 2008, TMIE was performed in the lateral decubitus position without thoracic duct resection (standard TMIE). From 2009 onwards, TMIE with extended lymph node and thoracic duct resection was introduced (extended TMIE). Demographics, co-morbidity, number of retrieved lymph nodes, pathology, postoperative complications and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between groups.Forty-four patients underwent standard TMIE and 191 extended TMIE. There were no significant differences in clinical and pathological tumour stage or postoperative complications. The extended-TMIE group had more lymph nodes removed at nodal stations 106recL and 112. Among patients with cT1 N0 disease, RFS was better in the extended-TMIE group (P &lt; 0·001), whereas there was no difference in RFS between groups in patients with advanced disease.Extended TMIE including thoracic duct resection increased the number of lymph nodes retrieved and was associated with improved survival in patients with cT1 N0 oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma."	"<b>Background</b>: Transthoracic hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (HMIE) is frequently performed in patients with esophageal cancer. However, no conclusive benefit has been defined for HMIE compared with open esophagectomy (OE) or totally MIE (TMIE). The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of HMIE compared with OE and TMIE.<b>Methods</b>: PubMed, Embase (via OVID) and Cochrane databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies up to January 2019. Studies comparing the efficacy of transthoracic HMIE with OE or TMIE were included in this meta-analysis.<b>Results:</b> Twenty-nine relevant studies comprising 3994 patients were identified and included in the analysis of HMIE <i>vs</i> OE. HMIE decreased the incidence of postoperative total morbidity (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.80, <i>p</i> = 0.00), pneumonia (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.00), in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.83, <i>p</i> = 0.01), duration of hospitalization (SMD=-1.03, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.00) and the estimated intraoperative blood loss (SMD=-1.01, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.00) compared with OE. Twenty-one relevant studies comprising 3007 patients were identified and included in the analysis of HMIE <i>vs</i> TMIE. HMIE increased estimated intraoperative blood loss [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.02, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.58, <i>p</i> = 0.00] and the incidence of postoperative pneumonia (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.26, <i>p</i> = 0.00) compared with TMIE. No statistical differences were observed for other surgical outcomes.<b>Conclusions:</b> In our opinion, HMIE is a promising surgical technique. But further RCTs are still needed to confirm the advantages and disadvantages of HMIE mentioned above."	"The tumor microenvironment (TME) acts as an ecosystem that includes not only tumor cells, but also stromal cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In addition, the abnormal extracellular environment (ECM), of which the mechanical forces are regulated by fibronectin (Fn) and collagen I, orchestrates tumorigenesis and progression by directly promoting invasion and cellular transformation of the ecosystem. Herein, we develop a novel peptide-modified liposome incorporated into doxorubicin (FnBPA5-AAN-Dox) as an ecological therapy system, which targets not only the cellular compartment but also non-cellular components of breast cancer. FnBPA5 is a Fn-binding peptide showing high affinity with relaxed Fn and collagen I in the ECM as well as α-SMA-expressing CAFs. However, the fast clearance by Fn-excreting organs such as the liver and spleen limits the accumulation of FnBPA5-Dox in the TME. The AAN peptide, which targets legumain overexpressed in the TAMs, could extend the circulation time and improve the therapeutic response as well as modulate the tumor immune microenvironment (TMIE). Given twice at an equivalent dose of 5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> intravenously, the multi-in-one 'ecological therapy' applied AAN-FnBPA5-Dox showed excellent antitumor efficacy in 4T1 breast cancer mice, and the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) is up to 98.20% compared with saline. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results revealed that the dramatic improvement in antitumor efficacy can be attributed to the multifunctional targets of the drug delivery system."	"Actin-rich structures, like stereocilia and microvilli, are assembled with precise control of length, diameter, and relative spacing. By quantifying actin-core dimensions of stereocilia from phalloidin-labeled mouse cochleas, we demonstrated that inner hair cell stereocilia developed in specific stages, where a widening phase is sandwiched between two lengthening phases. Moreover, widening of the second-tallest stereocilia rank (row 2) occurred simultaneously with the appearance of mechanotransduction. Correspondingly, Tmc1<sup>KO/KO</sup>;Tmc2<sup>KO/KO</sup> or Tmie<sup>KO/KO</sup> hair cells, which lack transduction, have significantly altered stereocilia lengths and diameters, including a narrowed row 2. EPS8 and the short splice isoform of MYO15A, identity markers for mature row 1 (the tallest row), lost their row exclusivity in transduction mutants. GNAI3, another member of the mature row 1 complex, accumulated at mutant row 1 tips at considerably lower levels than in wild-type bundles. Alterations in stereocilia dimensions and in EPS8 distribution seen in transduction mutants were mimicked by block of transduction channels of cochlear explants in culture. In addition, proteins normally concentrated at mature row 2 tips were also distributed differently in transduction mutants; the heterodimeric capping protein subunit CAPZB and its partner TWF2 never concentrated at row 2 tips like they do in wild-type bundles. The altered distribution of marker proteins in transduction mutants was accompanied by increased variability in stereocilia length. Transduction channels thus specify and maintain row identity, control addition of new actin filaments to increase stereocilia diameter, and coordinate stereocilia height within rows."	"<i>Background</i>. Chylothorax is a rare but severe complication after esophagectomy with an incidence of 1.9% to 8.9%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative lipid-rich feeding in reducing the incidence of post-esophagectomy chylothorax. <i>Methods.</i> A retrospective cohort study was performed among patients who underwent totally minimally invasive esophagectomy with intrathoracic anastomosis (tMIE Ivor Lewis) from February 2015 until December 2016. In this group, a lipid-rich solution was administered intraoperatively via a feeding jejunostomy. A historical cohort of identical patients operated in the period December 2012 to February 2015 did not receive intraoperative feeding and was used as a control. <i>Results.</i> In total, 133 patients underwent tMIE Ivor Lewis, of whom 59 patients (44%) received lipid-rich solution intraoperatively. The administered median total volume was 800 mL. During thoracic dissection, the thoracic duct was clearly visible in 37 patients (63%). With the help of lipid-rich feeding, intraoperative unintended duct damage was detected in 3 patients and treated. Postoperatively, 1 out of 59 patients (1.7%) developed chylothorax that was managed nonoperatively. In the control group, chylothorax was seen in 3 out of 74 patients (4.1%), <i>P</i> = .629. <i>Conclusions.</i> Intraoperative lipid-rich solution through a feeding jejunostomy helps identify thoracic duct damage during tMIE and may reduce postoperative chylothorax."	"Mutations in transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) cause deafness in humans; previous studies suggest involvement in the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) complex in sensory hair cells, but TMIE's precise role is unclear. In tmie zebrafish mutants, we observed that GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b, which are subunits of the MET channel, fail to target to the hair bundle. In contrast, overexpression of Tmie strongly enhances the targeting of Tmc1-GFP and Tmc2b-GFP to stereocilia. To identify the motifs of Tmie underlying the regulation of the Tmcs, we systematically deleted or replaced peptide segments. We then assessed localization and functional rescue of each mutated/chimeric form of Tmie in tmie mutants. We determined that the first putative helix was dispensable and identified a novel critical region of Tmie, the extracellular region and transmembrane domain, which is required for both mechanosensitivity and Tmc2b-GFP expression in bundles. Collectively, our results suggest that Tmie's role in sensory hair cells is to target and stabilize Tmc channel subunits to the site of MET."	"Mediastinal leakage (ML) is one of the most feared complications of esophagectomy. A standard strategy for its diagnosis and treatment has been difficult to establish because of the great variability in their incidence and mortality rates reported in the existing series.To assess the incidence, predictive factors, treatment, and associated mortality rate of mediastinal leakage using the standardized definition of mediastinal leaks recently proposed by the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG).Seven Italian surgical centers (five high-volume, two low-volume) affiliated with the Italian Society for the Study of Esophageal Diseases designed and implemented a retrospective study including all esophagectomies (<i>n</i> = 501) with intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis performed from 2014 to 2017. Anastomotic MLs were defined according to the classification recently proposed by the ECCG.Fifty-nine cases of ML were recorded, yielding an overall incidence of 11.8% (95%CI: 9.1%-14.9%). The surgical approach significantly influenced the occurrence of ML: the proportion of leakage was 10.5% and 9% after open and hybrid esophagectomy (HE), respectively, and doubled (20%) after totally minimally invasive esophagectomy (TMIE) (<i>P</i> = 0.016). No other predictive factors were found. The 30- and 90-d overall mortality rates were 1.4% and 3.2%, respectively; the 30- and 90-d leak-related mortality rates were 5.1% and 10.2%, respectively; the 90-d mortality rates for TMIE and HE were 5.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Endoscopy was the first-line treatment in 49% of ML cases, with the need for retreatment in 17.2% of cases. Surgery was needed in 44.1% of ML cases. Endoscopic treatment had the lowest mortality rate (6.9%). Removal of the gastric tube with stoma formation was necessary in 8 (13.6%) cases.The incidence of ML after esophagectomy was high mainly in the TMIE group. However, the general and specific (leak-related) mortality rates were low. Early treatment (surgical or endoscopic) of severe leaks is mandatory to limit related mortality."	"The number of elderly patients suffering from esophageal cancer is increasing, due to an increasing incidence of esophageal cancer and increasing life expectancy. However, the effect of age on morbidity, mortality, and survival after Ivor Lewis total minimally invasive esophagectomy (TMIE) is not well known.A prospectively documented database from December 2010 to June 2017 was analyzed, including all patients who underwent Ivor Lewis TMIE for esophageal cancer in three Dutch high-volume esophageal cancer centers. Patients younger than 75 years (younger group) were compared to patients aged 75 years or older (elderly group). Baseline patient characteristics and perioperative data were included. Surgical complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo scale. The primary outcome was postoperative complications Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3. Secondary outcome parameters were postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality, 30- and 90-day mortality and survival.Four hundred and forty-six patients were included, 357 in the younger and 89 in the elderly group. No significant differences were recorded regarding baseline patient characteristics. There was no significant difference in complications graded Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3 and overall complications, short-term mortality, and survival. Delirium occurred in 27.0% in the elderly and 11.8% in the younger group (p &lt; 0.001). After correction for baseline comorbidity this difference remained significant (p = 0.001). Median hospital length of stay was 13 days in the elderly and 11 days in the younger group (p = 0.010).Ivor Lewis TMIE can be safely performed in selected elderly patients without increasing postoperative morbidity and mortality."	"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. The aim of this study was to clarify the genetic aetiology of nonsyndromic hearing loss in the Moravian-Silesian population of the Czech Republic.This study included 200 patients (93 males, 107 females, mean age 16.9 years, ranging from 4 months to 62 years) with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. We screened all patients for mutations in <i>GJB2</i> and the large deletion del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830). We performed further screening for additional genes (<i>SERPINB6</i>, <i>TMIE</i>, <i>COCH</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>KCNQ4</i>, and <i>GJB3</i>) with Sanger sequencing on a subset of patients that were negative for <i>GJB2</i> mutations.We detected biallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutations in 44 patients (22%). Among these patients, 63.6%, 9.1% and 2.3% exhibited homozygous c.35delG, p.Trp24*, and p.Met34Thr mutations, respectively. The remaining 25% of these patients exhibited compound heterozygous c.35delG, c.-23+1G&gt;A, p.Trp24*, p.Val37Ile, p.Met34Thr, p.Leu90Pro, c.235delC, c.313_326del14, p.Ser139Asn, and p.Gly147Leu mutations. We found a monoallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutation in 12 patients (6.6%). We found no pathogenic mutations in the other tested genes. <i>Conclusions:</i> One fifth of our cohort had deafness related to <i>GJB2</i> mutations. The del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830), <i>SERPINB6</i>, <i>TMIE</i>, <i>COCH</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>GJB3</i>, and <i>KCNQ4</i> mutations were infrequently associated with deafness in the Moravian-Silesian population. Therefore, we suggest that del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830) testing should be performed only when patients with deafness carry the monoallelic <i>GJB2</i> mutation."	"The TMC1 channel was identified as a protein essential for hearing in mouse and human, and recognized as one of a family of eight such proteins in mammals. The TMC family is part of a superfamily of seven branches, which includes the TMEM16s. Vertebrate hair cells express both TMC1 and TMC2. They are located at the tips of stereocilia and are required for hair cell mechanotransduction. TMC1 assembles as a dimer and its similarity to the TMEM16s has enabled a predicted tertiary structure with an ion conduction pore in each subunit of the dimer. Cysteine mutagenesis of the pore supports the role of TMC1 and TMC2 as the core channel proteins of a larger mechanotransduction complex that includes PCDH15 and LHFPL5, and perhaps TMIE, CIB2 and others."	"Totally minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (Ivor Lewis TMIE) is a technically challenging procedure and is associated with a learning curve. Refinement of surgical technique is an important part of this learning curve. However, detailed descriptions of these refinements according to the idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term follow-up (IDEAL) framework are lacking and this study was undertaken to fill this knowledge gap. From 2010 until 2016, all consecutive patients (n = 164) were included from the first patient undergoing Ivor Lewis TMIE. Surgical reports were analyzed and surgeons were interviewed to determine surgical refinements. These data were used to describe the transition of the surgical technique from IDEAL stage IIB to stage III. The main findings were that four refinements were made to the surgical procedure in IDEAL stage IIB: (1) At case 9, the use of the 25 mm OrVil was abandoned, exchanged for a 28 mm EEA stapler and a large omental wrap around the anastomosis was introduced; (2) at case 27, the omental wrap was reduced in volume; (3) at case 60, the omental wrap was refined to cover the full 360° of the anastomosis and (4) at case 77, the fixation of the anvil with the Endostitch was replaced by fixation with two Endoloops®. During the transition from IDEAL stage IIB to stage III, the incidence of anastomotic leakage decreased from 26.0% to 4.6% (P &lt; 0.001) and the incidence of textbook outcome increased from 31.2% to 47.1% (P = 0.039). In conclusion, this study describes the surgical refinements that were made during the progression of Ivor Lewis TMIE from IDEAL stage IIB to IDEAL stage III. During IDEAL stage IIB, postoperative outcome improved as surgical proficiency was gained and the technique was refined."	"Totally minimally invasive esophagectomy (TMIE) is increasingly used in treatment of patients with esophageal carcinoma. However, it is currently unknown if McKeown TMIE or Ivor Lewis TMIE should be preferred for patients in whom both procedures are oncologically feasible.The study was performed in 4 high-volume Dutch esophageal cancer centers between November 2009 and April 2017. Prospectively collected data from consecutive patients with esophageal cancer localized in the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction undergoing McKeown TMIE or Ivor Lewis TMIE were included. Patients were propensity score matched for age, body mass index, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, Charlson Comorbidity Index, tumor type, tumor location, clinical stage, neoadjuvant treatment, and the hospital of surgery. The primary outcome parameter was anastomotic leakage requiring reintervention or reoperation. Secondary outcome parameters were operation characteristics, pathology results, complications, reinterventions, reoperations, length of stay, and mortality.Of all 787 included patients, 420 remained after matching. The incidence of anastomotic leakage requiring reintervention or reoperation was 23.3% after McKeown TMIE versus 12.4% after Ivor Lewis TMIE (P = 0.003). Ivor Lewis TMIE was significantly associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary complications (46.7% vs 31.9%), recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (9.5% vs 0.5%), reoperations (18.6% vs 11.0%), 90-day mortality (7.1% vs 2.9%), shorter median intensive care unit length of stay (2 days vs 1 day) and shorter median hospital length of stay (12 vs 11 days) (all P &lt; 0.05). R0 resection rate was similar between the groups. The median number of examined lymph nodes was 21 after McKeown TMIE and 25 after Ivor Lewis TMIE (P &lt; 0.001).Ivor Lewis TMIE is associated with a lower incidence of anastomotic leakage, 90-day mortality and other postoperative morbidity compared to McKeown TMIE in patients in whom both procedures are oncologically feasible."	"Hair cells in the inner ear convert mechanical stimuli provided by sound waves and head movements into electrical signal. Several mechanically evoked ionic currents with different properties have been recorded in hair cells. The search for the proteins that form the underlying ion channels is still in progress. The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel near the tips of stereociliary in hair cells, which is responsible for sensory transduction, has been studied most extensively. Several components of the sensory mechanotransduction machinery in stereocilia have been identified, including the multi-transmembrane proteins tetraspan membrane protein in hair cell stereocilia (TMHS)/LHFPL5, transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) and transmembrane channel-like proteins 1 and 2 (TMC1/2). However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the molecules that form the channel pore. In addition to the sensory MET channel, hair cells express the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2, which is localized near the base of stereocilia and not essential for sensory transduction. The function of PIEZO2 in hair cells is not entirely clear but it might have a role in damage sensing and repair processes. Additional stretch-activated channels of unknown molecular identity and function have been found to localize at the basolateral membrane of hair cells. Here, we review current knowledge regarding the different mechanically gated ion channels in hair cells and discuss open questions concerning their molecular composition and function."	"A high incidence of hearing impairment is reported from the village of Dhadkai in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Prevalence of endogamy in this community suggested a common genetic basis for the disorder. A genetic study was undertaken to ascertain the basis for the high incidence of hearing impairment in this region.In a two-step approach to identify the causative mutation/s, a whole-genome-based linkage analysis of an extended family of 45 members was carried out, which included 23 affected and 22 unaffected members. Mutational analysis for the candidate deafness genes helped reveal causative mutations in the family. In addition, seven deafness-causing genes, Cx26, SLC26A4, CLDN14, TMPRSS3, TMC1, TMIE and USH1C, were analyzed in smaller families with hearing impairment.In the 45-member extended family, the critical chromosomal region mapped to 2p24-p22.The c.2122C&gt;T (p.R708X) mutation in OTOF in 2p24-p22was identified as being the causal change. Linkage to 2p24-p22 locus was not observed in a particular branch of this extended family. Analysis of seven known deafness-causing genes in this branch revealed a mutation, c.254T&gt;A (p.V85D), in CLDN14. Among seven small families unrelated to the 45-member extended family, hearing loss was attributable to p.R708X in OTOF in three families and to p.V85D in CLDN14 in one family; a new mutation c.1668T&gt;A (p.Y556X) SLC26A4 was identified in two families and the causative change could not be identified in one family.This study suggested considerable genetic heterogeneity in the causation of hearing loss in Dhadkai. Recessive mutations were observed in at least three genes causing hearing loss: OTOF (p.R708X), SLC26A4 (p.Y556X) and CLDN14 (p.V85D). Mutation p.R708X appeared to be the major cause of hearing impairment in Dhadkai."	"The circling mouse serves as a hearing loss model. It has spontaneous tmie gene mutations that cause hair cell and cochlear degeneration. However, little is known about the role of the tmie gene in superior olivary complex (SOC) regions, in which sound information from the two ears is integrated and primarily relayed to the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus. Several studies have reported that abnormal calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is associated with the pathology of hearing loss. This study investigated the distribution of Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs), such as calbindin D28k, parvalbumin, and calretinin, in the SOC of the circling mouse on postnatal day 16. A comparison of wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/cir), and homozygous (cir/cir) mice showed that CaBP immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in the auditory nucleus of the SOC of homozygous (cir/cir) mice. A decline in the CaBPs level in the SOC may be the result of hearing loss through hair cell and cochlear degeneration following tmie gene mutation."	"Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder that affects approximately one per 1000 live births. With this project, we aimed to identify gene variants that were common causes of hearing loss in Turkey to contribute to the planning of genetic screening programs for hearing loss, as well as to improve genetic counseling to affected families.Twenty-one families with at least two affected individuals and parental consanguinity who presented with non-syndromic severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss were included in this study. We first screened for mutations in GJB2 and mitochondrial DNA 12S RNA genes. Subsequently, we genotyped the TMIE c.250C&gt;T and SNP markers flanking the <i>SLC26A4, MYO7A, MYO15A, OTOF, CDH23, TMIE, TECTA, PCDH15, TMC1, TMPRSS3, TMHS</i> genes in the remaining twelve families without mutations in GJB2.Screening for mutations in GJB2 gene showed c.[35delG];[35delG] mutation in four families, c.[35delG];[507C&gt;A] mutation in two families, c.[35delG];[-23+1G&gt;A] mutation in one family, and c.457G&gt;A heterozygous mutation in one family. Genotyping SNP markers showed the c.[250C&gt;T];[250C&gt;T] mutation in TMIE in one family. A homozygous region with SNP genotypes was detected with the <i>OTOF</i> gene in one family, the <i>TMPRSS3</i> gene in another family, and also a homozygous region was detected with <i>TMHS, OTOF</i>, and <i>TMPRSS3</i> genes in another family.Further research will be required to determine the genetic bases of hearing loss in families with non-syndromic hearing loss."	"The circling mice with <i>tmie</i> gene mutation are known as an animal deafness model, which showed hyperactive circling movement. Recently, the reinvestigation of circling mouse was performed to check the inner ear pathology as a main lesion of early hearing loss. In this trial, the inner ear organs were not so damaged to cause the hearing deficit of circling (cir/cir) mouse at 18 postnatal day (P18) though auditory brainstem response data indicated hearing loss of cir/cir mice at P18. Thus, another mechanism may be correlated with the early hearing loss of cir/cir mice at P18. Hearing loss in the early life can disrupt the ascending and descending information to inferior colliculus (IC) as integration site. There were many reports that hearing loss could result in the changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration by either cochlear ablation or genetic defect. However, little was known to be reported about the correlation between the pathology of IC and Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in circling mice. Therefore, the present study investigated the distribution of calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs), calbindin-D28k, parvalbumin, and calretinin immunoreactivity (IR) in the IC to compare among wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/cir), and homozygous (cir/cir) mice by immunohistochemistry. The decreases of CaBPs IR in cir/cir were statistically significant in the neurons as well as neuropil of IC. Thus, this study proposed overall distributional alteration of CaBPs IR in the IC caused by early hearing defect and might be helpful to elucidate the pathology of central auditory disorder related with Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism."	"Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has consistently been associated with improved perioperative outcome and similar oncological safety compared to open esophagectomy. However, it is currently unclear what type of MIE is preferred for patients with resectable esophageal cancer.Literature was searched in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane library combining relevant search terms. Articles that included patients undergoing totally minimally invasive esophagectomy (TMIE) or hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (HMIE) and compared McKeown with Ivor Lewis procedures were included. Studies were excluded if they included &gt;10% of patients undergoing a procedure other than MIE McKeown or MIE Ivor Lewis (i.e., transhiatal resections). The primary outcome parameter was anastomotic leakage. Secondary outcome parameters were: other complications, reinterventions, reoperations, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, postoperative mortality, operative time, blood loss, R0 resection rate, lymph nodes examined, quality of life and costs.Five studies with a total of 1,681 patients undergoing TMIE were included. There were no studies comparing HMIE McKeown versus HMIE Ivor Lewis. There were no randomized controlled trials and all included studies were cohort studies with a moderate risk of bias. No meta-analysis could be performed for R0 resection rate, survival, quality of life and costs because there was insufficient data available for these parameters. The incidence of anastomotic leakage did not differ between the groups [relative risk (RR) =1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.90-10.38, P=0.14]. TMIE Ivor Lewis was associated with a lower incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) trauma (RR =6.70, 95% CI =3.09-14.55, P&lt;0.001), a shorter hospital length of stay [standardized mean difference (SMD) =0.17, 95% CI =0.06-0.28, P=0.002] and less blood loss (SMD =0.69, 95% CI =0.25-1.12, P=0.002).TMIE Ivor Lewis is associated with improved outcome regarding RLN trauma, hospital length of stay and blood loss as compared to TMIE-McKeown, but the incidence of anastomotic leakage is not different. The evidence is limited, of low quality and at risk for bias. A randomized controlled trial is currently being performed in order to demonstrate whether a McKeown or Ivor Lewis procedure should be preferred in patients undergoing MIE."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Circling mouse (C57BL/6J-<i>cir</i>/<i>cir</i>) deleted the transmembrane inner ear (<i>Tmie</i>) gene is an animal model for human non-syndromic recessive deafness, DFNB6. In circling mouse, hair cells in the cochlea have degenerated and hair bundles have become irregularity as time goes on. Tmie protein carries out a function of the mechanoelectrical transduction channel in cochlear hair cells. Myosin7a (MYO7A) protein has key roles in development of the cochlear hair bundles as well as in the function of cochlear hair cells. To find whether Tmie protein interacts with MYO7A proteins in the cochlea postnatal developmental stage, we investigated expression of the MYO7A proteins in the cochlear hair cells of circling mice by western blot analysis and whole mount immunofluorescence at postnatal day 5 (P5). The expression of MYO7A showed statistically significant increase in the cochlea of C57BL/6J-+/<i>cir</i> and C57BL/6J-<i>cir</i>/<i>cir</i> mice than that of C57BL/6J-+/+ mice. The MYO7A intensity of the cochlear hair cells also increased in C57BL/6J-+/<i>cir</i> and C57BL/6J-<i>cir</i>/<i>cir</i> mice compared with those of C57BL/6J-+/+ mice. Taken together, the results indicate that Tmie protein may have an important role with MYO7A protein in the development and maintenance of the stereociliary bundles during postnatal developmental stage of the cochlea."
"TMPRSS3"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"<b>Objective:</b> To detect potential mutations in two Chinese families affected with deafness, so as provide prenatal diagnosis for them. <b>Methods:</b> Two Chinese families affected with deafness were identified at the genetic and prenatal diagnosis center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from March 2018 to December 2018.Mutation analyses were carried out by next generation sequencing (NGS),suspected mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing in the probands, unaffected relatives. Prenatal diagnosis for high-risk fetus were carried out through Sanger sequencing. <b>Results:</b> The proband of family 1 carried a c.432delA and a c.617-2_617-1insTC mutation of the <i>TMPRSS3</i> gene, the proband of family 2 carried a c.271C&gt;T(p.R91X) and a c.147dupTmutation ofthe <i>TMPRSS3</i> gene, both parents of the two probands were carriers of heterozygous variants. <b>Conclusions:</b> Mutations in the <i>TMPRSS3</i> gene are the suspected cause of deafness in two families. Application of next generation sequencing technologies make gene diagnosis of deafness efficiently and accurately and the molecular findings increase our understanding of the function of <i>TMPRSS3</i> gene and enrich the human gene mutation database. It is helpful for recurrent genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for these families."	"<b>目的：</b> 对两个耳聋家系进行遗传性耳聋基因突变检测，为家系遗传咨询与产前诊断提供参考。 <b>方法：</b> 2018年3—12月，郑州大学第一附属医院遗传与产前诊断中心应用二代测序技术对两个家系患儿进行耳聋基因检测（包含168个已知致病基因，包括核基因、相关线粒体区域及miRNA），并对可疑基因在患儿及家系成员中进行Sanger双向测序验证，确定致病突变后，对两个家系的高危胎儿进行产前诊断。 <b>结果：</b> 家系1患儿检测到<i>TMPRSS3</i>基因c.432delA和c.617-2_617-1insTC复合杂合突变，家系2患儿检测到<i>TMPRSS3</i>基因c.271C&gt;T(p.R91X）和c.147dupT复合杂合突变，两家系患儿父母均为携带者。产前诊断结果显示两家系胎儿均只携带1个杂合突变。随访至2019年8月，两家系二胎分别为15月龄和13月龄，听力未见异常。 <b>结论：</b><i>TMPRSS3</i>基因突变可能是两个耳聋家系的致病基因，用二代测序技术可以高效、经济准确地对遗传性耳聋患者进行基因诊断，为家系遗传咨询和产前诊断提供参考。.A previous study indicated that mutations in the transmembrane protease serine 3 (TMPRSS3) gene, which encodes a transmembrane serine protease, cause nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). This was the first description of a serine protease involved in hearing loss (HL). In Taiwan, however, data on the TMPRSS3 gene's association with NSHL is still insufficient. In this study, we described 10 mutations of TMPRSS3 genes found in 14 patients after screening 230 children with NSHL. The prevalence of the TMPRSS3 mutation appeared to be 6.09% (14/230). Of the 10 mutations, three were missense mutations: c.239G&gt;A (p.R80H), c.551T&gt;C (p.L184S), and 1253C&gt;T (p.A418V); three were silent mutations, and four were mutations in introns. To determine the functional importance of TMPRSS3 mutations, we constructed plasmids carrying TMPRSS3 mutations of p.R80H, p.L184S, and p.A418V. TMPRSS3 function can be examined by secretory genetic assay for site-specific proteolysis (sGASP) and Xenopus oocyte expression system. Our results showed that p.R80H, p.L184S, and p.A418V TMPRSS3 mutations gave ratios of 19.4%, 13.2%, and 27.6%, respectively, via the sGASP system. Moreover, these three TMPRSS3 mutations failed to activate the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. These results indicate that the p.R80H, p.L184S, and p.A418V missense mutations of TMPRSS3 resulted in greatly diminishing the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS3. Our study provides information for understanding the importance of TMPRSS3 in the NSHL of Taiwanese children and provides a novel molecular explanation for the role of TMPRSS3 in HL."	"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is one of the major leading causes of hearing impairment, and is typically characterized by the degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). In previous studies by the authors, it was demonstrated that microRNA (miRNA or miR)‑204‑5p decreased the viability of SGNs by inhibiting the expression of transmembrane protease, serine 3 (TMPRSS3), which was closely associated with the development of SGNs. However, the upstream regulatory mechanism of miR‑204‑5p was not fully elucidated. The present study found that an important upstream regulatory factor of miR‑204‑5p, long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) EBLN3P, was expressed at low levels in impaired SGNs, whereas it was expressed at high levels in normal SGNs. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that lncRNA EBLN3P functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) when regulating miR‑204‑5p in normal SGNs. In addition, lncRNA EBLN3P regulated TMPRSS3 expression via the regulation of miR‑204‑5p in normal SGNs. In vitro functional analysis revealed that lncRNA EBLN3P promoted the recovery of the viability of normal SGNs and inhibited the apoptosis of normal SGNs. Finally, the results revealed a recovery‑promoting effect of lncRNA EBLN3P on the structure and function of impaired SGNs in models of deafness. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that lncRNA EBLN3P promotes the recovery of the function of impaired SGNs by competitively binding to miR‑204‑5p and regulating TMPRSS3 expression. This suggests that lncRNA EBLN3P may be a potential therapeutic target for diseases involving SNHL."	"Hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder affecting approximately 360 million people worldwide and is among the most common sensorineural disorders. Here, we report a genetic analysis of seven large consanguineous families segregating prelingual sensorineural hearing loss. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed seven different pathogenic variants segregating with hearing loss in these families, three novel variants (c.1204G&gt;A, c.322G&gt;T, and c.5587C&gt;T) in <i>TMPRSS3, ESRRB,</i> and <i>OTOF</i>, and four previously reported variants (c.208C&gt;T, c.6371G&gt;A, c.226G&gt;A, and c.494C&gt;T) in <i>LRTOMT</i>, <i>MYO15A</i>, <i>KCNE1</i>, and <i>LHFPL5</i>, respectively<i>.</i> All identified variants had very low frequencies in the control databases and were predicted to have pathogenic effects on the encoded proteins. In addition to being familial, we also found intersibship locus heterogeneity in the evaluated families. The known pathogenic c.226C&gt;T variant identified in <i>KCNE1</i> only segregates with the hearing loss phenotype in a subset of affected members of the family GCNF21. This study further highlights the challenges of identifying disease-causing variants for highly heterogeneous disorders and reports the identification of three novel and four previously reported variants in seven known deafness genes."	"Over the last two decades, a novel subgroup of serine proteases, the cell surface-anchored serine proteases, has emerged as an important component of the human degradome, and several members have garnered significant attention for their roles in cancer progression and metastasis. A large body of literature describes that cell surface-anchored serine proteases are deregulated in cancer and that they contribute to both tumor formation and metastasis through diverse molecular mechanisms. The loss of precise regulation of cell surface-anchored serine protease expression and/or catalytic activity may be contributing to the etiology of several cancer types. There is therefore a strong impetus to understand the events that lead to deregulation at the gene and protein levels, how these precipitate in various stages of tumorigenesis, and whether targeting of selected proteases can lead to novel cancer intervention strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge about cell surface-anchored serine proteases and their role in cancer based on biochemical characterization, cell culture-based studies, expression studies, and in vivo experiments. Efforts to develop inhibitors to target cell surface-anchored serine proteases in cancer therapy will also be summarized."	"Hearing loss (HL) is the most common disability of human senses characterized by a great allelic heterogeneity. GJB2 and TMPRSS3 are two well-known HL genes typically underlying its monogenic form. Recently, TMPRSS3/GJB2 digenic inheritance has been proposed. As results of genetic testing can be easily overinterpreted, we aimed to verify the hypothesis.From genetic database of HL patients with at least one TMPRSS3 pathogenic variants we have selected individuals with additional GJB2 pathogenic variants. All of the available family members were recruited for the study. Segregation analysis of the respective TMPRSS3 and GJB2 pathogenic variants was performed within the families.The strategy has allowed to identify four individuals who were double heterozygous for known pathogenic TMPRSS3 and GJB2 variants. Two individuals from different families had GJB2 c.35delG and TMPRSS3 c.208delC and in two other individuals from one family GJB2 c.35delG together with TMPRSS3 c.1343T&gt;C variants were found. None of these subjects has ever reported hearing problems and their hearing status was normal.Our data provide evidence against TMPRSS3/GJB2 digenic inheritance of HL. As high throughput sequencing is increasingly used for genetic testing, particular caution should be taken to provide the patients with accurate genetic counseling."	"The present study aimed to investigate the functions and regulation mechanism of the transmembrane protease, serine 3 (TMPRSS3), which plays an important role in sensorineural hearing loss.House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells, comprising auditory-related cells, were used in the present study. An overexpression vector and small hairpin RNA target on TMPRSS3 were designed and transfected into HEI-OC1 cells. Circular RNA (circRNA) sequencing was conducted and expression profiles were obtained. The circular structure of circRNAs was validated with a polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing using convergent and divergent primers.Overexpression of TMPRSS3 increased cell viability, whereas suppression of TMPRSS3 increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and decreased cell viability, compared to the control group. circRNA sequencing provided expression profiles indicating that the overexpression of TMPRSS3 increased the expression level of 195 circRNAs. Results of GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) studies indicated that the circRNAs are focused on the RAS signaling pathway. The pathway, circ-Slc41a2 (chr10: 82744115|82767120), miR-182 and Akt, might comprise one of the key cascades of TMPRSS3.TMPRSS3 is an important molecule in the regulation of cell viability and cell apoptosis of HEI-OC1 cells. Its functions are dependent on the circ-Slc41a2, miR-182 and Akt cascade."	"Hearing loss or hearing impairment is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 117 genes were discovered to date in hereditary, nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Identifying novel gene variants and their frequency in specific populations is valuable for public health and potentially for genetic screening of NSHL.To identify the gene variants underlying NSHL in a Pakistani cohort.A cohort of 40 school-aged children with NSHL was initially screened for variants in GJB2, the gene with the highest incidence of variants in other populations with NSHL. We found known homozygous as well as compound heterozygous GJB variants in 15 individuals. Next, we used targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) for the remaining 25 individuals and identified 20 different variants in 14 genes (SLC26A4, KCNQ4, MYO7A, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, ESPN, TMC1, GIPC3, LHFPL5, WFS1, DFNB59, GRXCR1, ESRRB, and LRTOMT).We described common and novel variants in 15 genes in a Pakistani cohort of NSHL."	"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a highly heterogeneous disease involving more than 70 pathogenic genes. However, most ARNSHL families have small-sized pedigrees with limited genetic information, rendering challenges for the molecular diagnosis of these patients. Therefore, we attempted to establish a strategy for identifying deleterious variants associated with ARNSHL by applying proband whole-exome sequencing (proband-WES). Aside from desiring to improve molecular diagnostic rates, we also aimed to search for novel deafness genes shared by patients with similar phenotype, making up for the deficiency of small ARNSHL families. In this study, 48.5% (16/33) families were detected the pathogenic variants in eight known deafness genes, including 10 novel variants identified in <i>TMPRSS3</i> (MIM 605551), <i>MYO15A</i> (MIM 602666), <i>TMC1</i> (MIM 606706), <i>ADGRV1</i> (MIM 602851), and <i>PTPRQ</i> (MIM 603317). Apart from six novel variants with a truncating effect (nonsense, deletion, insertion, and splice-site), four novel missense variants were not found in 200 unrelated control population by using Sanger sequencing. It is important to note that none of novel genes were shared across different pedigrees, indicating that a larger sample size might be needed. Proband-WES is a cost-effective and precise way of identifying causative variants in nuclear families with ARNSHL. This economical strategy may be appropriated as a clinical application to provide molecular diagnostics, genetic counseling, and individualized health maintenance measures for patients with ARNSHL at hearing clinics."	"Mutations in the gene encoding the type II transmembrane protease 3 (TMPRSS3) cause human hearing loss, although the underlying mechanisms that result in TMPRSS3-related hearing loss are still unclear. We combined the use of stem cell-derived inner ear organoids with single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the role of TMPRSS3. Defective Tmprss3 leads to hair cell apoptosis without altering the development of hair cells and the formation of the mechanotransduction apparatus. Prior to degeneration, Tmprss3-KO hair cells demonstrate reduced numbers of BK channels and lower expressions of genes encoding calcium ion-binding proteins, suggesting a disruption in intracellular homeostasis. A proteolytically active TMPRSS3 was detected on cell membranes in addition to ER of cells in inner ear organoids. Our in vitro model recapitulated salient features of genetically associated inner ear abnormalities and will serve as a powerful tool for studying inner ear disorders."	"Late-onset, down-sloping sensorineural hearing loss has many genetic and nongenetic etiologies, but the proportion of this commonly encountered type of hearing loss attributable to genetic causes is not well known. In this study, the authors performed genetic analysis using next-generation sequencing techniques in patients showing late-onset, down-sloping sensorineural hearing loss with preserved low-frequency hearing, and investigated the clinical implications of the variants identified.From a cohort of patients with hearing loss at a tertiary referral hospital, 18 unrelated probands with down-sloping sensorineural hearing loss of late onset were included in this study. Down-sloping hearing loss was defined as a mean low-frequency threshold at 250 Hz and 500 Hz less than or equal to 40 dB HL and a mean high-frequency threshold at 1, 2, and 4 kHz greater than 40 dB HL. The authors performed whole-exome sequencing and segregation analysis to identify the genetic causes and evaluated the outcomes of auditory rehabilitation in the patients.There were nine simplex and nine multiplex families included, in which the causative variants were found in six of 18 probands, demonstrating a detection rate of 33.3%. Various types of variants, including five novel and three known variants, were detected in the MYH14, MYH9, USH2A, COL11A2, and TMPRSS3 genes. The outcome of cochlear and middle ear implants in patients identified with pathogenic variants was satisfactory. There was no statistically significant difference between pathogenic variant-positive and pathogenic variant-negative groups in terms of onset age, family history of hearing loss, pure-tone threshold, or speech discrimination scores.The proportion of patients with late-onset, down-sloping hearing loss identified with potentially causative variants was unexpectedly high. Identification of the causative variants will offer insights on hearing loss progression and prognosis regarding various modes of auditory rehabilitation, as well as possible concomitant syndromic features."	"Genetic variants in TMPRSS3 have been causally linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (HL) at the DFNB8 and DFNB10 loci. These variants include both single nucleotide and copy number variations (CNVs). In this study, we aim to identify the genetic cause in three Chinese subjects with prelingual profound sensorineural HL.We applied targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing to screen 110 genes associated with nonsyndromic HL in the three affected subjects. CNVplex<sup>®</sup> analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed for CNV detection.We identified biallelic variations in TMPRSS3 including a novel complex genomic rearrangement and a novel missense mutation, c.551T&gt;C. We have mapped the breakpoints of the genomic rearrangement and showed that it consisted of two deletions and an inversion encompassing exon 3 to exon 9 of TMPRSS3.Our study expanded the mutational spectrum of TMPRSS3 to include complex genomic rearrangements. It showcased the importance of an integrative approach to investigate CNVs and their contribution to HL."	"Transmembrane protease serine 3 (TMPRSS3) is a member of type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) family, which play important roles in the development and progression of various cancers. However, the role of TMPRSS3 in glioma remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the expression patterns of TMPRSS3 in clinical tumor samples and glioma cell lines. The results showed that TMPRSS3 was highly expressed in both human glioma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of TMPRSS3 in glioma cells by transfection with small interfering RNA targeting TMPRSS3 (si-TMPRSS3) significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration/invasion. Moreover, knockdown of TMPRSS3 markedly elevated the apoptotic rate of glioma cells. Si-TMPRSS3 transfection also resulted in a remarkable increase in bax expression and a notable decrease in bcl-2 expression in glioma cells. Furthermore, TMPRSS3 knockdown markedly suppressed the expressions of Notch1 and Hes1. The results indicated that knockdown of TMPRSS3 exhibited antiglioma effect, which is associated with the inactivation of the Notch signaling pathway. These findings suggested that TMPRSS3 might be used as a therapeutic target for glioma treatment."	"Cochlear implantation, a surgical method to bypass cochlear hair cells and directly stimulate the spiral ganglion, is the standard treatment for severe-to-profound hearing loss. Changes in cochlear implant electrode array design and surgical approach now allow for preservation of acoustic hearing in the implanted ear. Electrocochleography (ECochG) was performed in eight hearing preservation subjects to assess hair cell and neural function and elucidate underlying genetic hearing loss. Three subjects had pathogenic variants in TMPRSS3 and five had pathogenic variants in genes known to affect the cochlear sensory partition. The mechanism by which variants in TMPRSS3 cause genetic hearing loss is unknown. We used a 500-Hz tone burst to record ECochG responses from an intracochlear electrode. Responses consist of a cochlear microphonic (hair cell) and an auditory nerve neurophonic. Cochlear microphonics did not differ between groups. Auditory nerve neurophonics were smaller, on average, in subjects with TMPRSS3 deafness. Results of this proof-of-concept study provide evidence that pathogenic variants in TMPRSS3 may impact function of the spiral ganglion. While ECochG as a clinical and research tool has been around for decades, this study illustrates a new application of ECochG in the study of genetic hearing and deafness in vivo."	"The transmembrane protease, serine 3 (TMPRSS3), a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family, plays an important role in mediating tissue development, homeostasis and various biological processes. Recently, TMPRSS3 has been reported to be involved in cancer progression. However, the role of TMPRSS3 in gastric cancer (GC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that TMPRSS3 was highly expressed in GC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of TMPRSS3 inhibited GC cell proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro as well as suppressed GC cell growth and dissemination in vivo. These inhibitory effects were mediated by regulation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Moreover, TMPRSS3-mediated ERK1/2 activation was dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. In conclusion, TMPRSS3 contributed to GC progression via activation of the PI3K/Akt/ERK signaling pathway and might act as a therapeutic target for GC treatment."	"TMPRSS3 (Trans-membrane Serine Protease 3) is a type II trans-membrane serine protease that has proteolytic activity essential for hearing. Mutations in the gene cause non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB8/10) in humans. Knowledge about its cellular distribution in the human inner ear may increase our understanding of its physiological role and involvement in deafness, ultimately leading to therapeutic interventions. In this study, we used super-resolution structured illumination microscopy for the first time together with transmission electron microscopy to localize the TMPRSS3 protein in the human organ of Corti. Archival human cochleae were dissected out during petroclival meningioma surgery. Microscopy with Zeiss LSM710 microscope achieved a lateral resolution of approximately 80 nm. TMPRSS3 was found to be associated with actin in both inner and outer hair cells. TMPRSS3 was located in cell surface-associated cytoskeletal bodies (surfoskelosomes) in inner and outer pillar cells and Deiters cells and in subcuticular organelles in outer hair cells. Our results suggest that TMPRSS3 proteolysis is linked to hair cell sterociliary mechanics and to the actin/microtubule networks that support cell motility and integrity."	"A high incidence of hearing impairment is reported from the village of Dhadkai in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Prevalence of endogamy in this community suggested a common genetic basis for the disorder. A genetic study was undertaken to ascertain the basis for the high incidence of hearing impairment in this region.In a two-step approach to identify the causative mutation/s, a whole-genome-based linkage analysis of an extended family of 45 members was carried out, which included 23 affected and 22 unaffected members. Mutational analysis for the candidate deafness genes helped reveal causative mutations in the family. In addition, seven deafness-causing genes, Cx26, SLC26A4, CLDN14, TMPRSS3, TMC1, TMIE and USH1C, were analyzed in smaller families with hearing impairment.In the 45-member extended family, the critical chromosomal region mapped to 2p24-p22.The c.2122C&gt;T (p.R708X) mutation in OTOF in 2p24-p22was identified as being the causal change. Linkage to 2p24-p22 locus was not observed in a particular branch of this extended family. Analysis of seven known deafness-causing genes in this branch revealed a mutation, c.254T&gt;A (p.V85D), in CLDN14. Among seven small families unrelated to the 45-member extended family, hearing loss was attributable to p.R708X in OTOF in three families and to p.V85D in CLDN14 in one family; a new mutation c.1668T&gt;A (p.Y556X) SLC26A4 was identified in two families and the causative change could not be identified in one family.This study suggested considerable genetic heterogeneity in the causation of hearing loss in Dhadkai. Recessive mutations were observed in at least three genes causing hearing loss: OTOF (p.R708X), SLC26A4 (p.Y556X) and CLDN14 (p.V85D). Mutation p.R708X appeared to be the major cause of hearing impairment in Dhadkai."	"Hereditary hearing loss (HL) is a common sensory disorder, with an incidence of 1-2 per 1000 newborns, and has a genetic etiology in over 50% of cases. It occurs either as part of a syndrome or in isolation and is genetically very heterogeneous which poses a challenge for clinical and molecular diagnosis. We used exome sequencing to seek a genetic cause in a group of 56 subjects (49 probands) with HL: 32 with non-syndromic non-GJB2 HL and 17 with syndromic HL. Following clinical examination and clinical exome sequencing, an etiological diagnosis was established in 15 probands (15/49; 30%); eight (8/17;47%) from the syndromic group and seven (7/32; 21%) from the non-syndromic non-GJB2 subgroup. Fourteen different (half of them novel) non-GJB2 variants causing HL were found in 10 genes (CHD7, HDAC8, MITF, NEFL, OTOF, SF3B4, SLC26A4, TECTA, TMPRSS3, USH2A) among 13 probands, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of hereditary HL. Different genetic causes for HL were found in a single family while three probands with apparent syndromic HL were found to have HL as a separate clinical feature, distinct from the complex phenotype. Clinical exome sequencing proved to be an effective tool used to comprehensively address the genetic heterogeneity of HL, to detect clinically unrecognized HL syndromes, and to decipher complex phenotypes in which HL is a separate feature and not part of a syndrome."	"We performed targeted re-sequencing to identify the genetic etiology of early-onset postlingual deafness and encountered a frequent <i>TMPRSS3</i> allele harboring two variants in a cis configuration. We aimed to evaluate the pathogenicity of the allele. Among 88 cochlear implantees with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss, subjects with <i>GJB2</i> and <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations were excluded. Thirty-one probands manifesting early-onset postlingual deafness were sorted. Through targeted re-sequencing, we detected two families with a <i>TMPRSS3</i> mutant allele containing p.V116M and p.V291L in a cis configuration, p.[p.V116M; p.V291L]. A minor allele frequency was calculated and proteolytic activity was measured. A p.[p.V116M; p.V291L] allele demonstrated a significantly higher frequency compared to normal controls and merited attention due to its high frequency (4.84%, 3/62). The first family showed a novel deleterious splice site variant-c.783-1G&gt;A-in a trans allele, while the other showed homozygosity. The progression to deafness was noted within the first decade, suggesting DFNB10. The proteolytic activity was significantly reduced, confirming the severe pathogenicity. This frequent mutant allele significantly contributes to early-onset postlingual deafness in Koreans. For clinical implication and proper auditory rehabilitation, it is important to pay attention to this allele with a severe pathogenic potential."	"Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder that affects approximately one per 1000 live births. With this project, we aimed to identify gene variants that were common causes of hearing loss in Turkey to contribute to the planning of genetic screening programs for hearing loss, as well as to improve genetic counseling to affected families.Twenty-one families with at least two affected individuals and parental consanguinity who presented with non-syndromic severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss were included in this study. We first screened for mutations in GJB2 and mitochondrial DNA 12S RNA genes. Subsequently, we genotyped the TMIE c.250C&gt;T and SNP markers flanking the <i>SLC26A4, MYO7A, MYO15A, OTOF, CDH23, TMIE, TECTA, PCDH15, TMC1, TMPRSS3, TMHS</i> genes in the remaining twelve families without mutations in GJB2.Screening for mutations in GJB2 gene showed c.[35delG];[35delG] mutation in four families, c.[35delG];[507C&gt;A] mutation in two families, c.[35delG];[-23+1G&gt;A] mutation in one family, and c.457G&gt;A heterozygous mutation in one family. Genotyping SNP markers showed the c.[250C&gt;T];[250C&gt;T] mutation in TMIE in one family. A homozygous region with SNP genotypes was detected with the <i>OTOF</i> gene in one family, the <i>TMPRSS3</i> gene in another family, and also a homozygous region was detected with <i>TMHS, OTOF</i>, and <i>TMPRSS3</i> genes in another family.Further research will be required to determine the genetic bases of hearing loss in families with non-syndromic hearing loss."
"TPRN"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to identify the potential prognostic marker genes associated with the progression of breast cancer. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to construct free-scale gene coexpression networks, evaluate the associations between the gene sets and clinical features, and identify candidate biomarkers. The gene expression profiles of GSE48213 were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. RNA-seq data and clinical information on breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used for validation. Four modules were identified from the gene coexpression network, one of which was found to be significantly associated with patient survival time. The expression status of 28 genes formed the black module (basal); 18 genes, dark red module (claudin-low); nine genes, brown module (luminal), and seven genes, midnight blue module (nonmalignant). These modules were clustered into two groups according to significant difference in survival time between the groups. Therefore, based on betweenness centrality, we identified <i>TXN</i> and <i>ANXA2</i> in the nonmalignant module, <i>TPM4</i> and <i>LOXL2</i> in the luminal module, <i>TPRN</i> and <i>ADCY6</i> in the claudin-low module, and <i>TUBA1C</i> and <i>CMIP</i> in the basal module as the genes with the highest betweenness, suggesting that they play a central role in information transfer in the network. In the present study, eight candidate biomarkers were identified for further basic and advanced understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer by using co-expression network analysis."	"The WHO Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management Research Network (TPRN) was established in 2016 in response to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015⁻2030. The TPRN facilitates global collaborative action for improving the scientific evidence base in health emergency and disaster risk management (Health EDRM). In 2018, the WHO convened a meeting to identify key research questions, bringing together leading experts from WHO, TPRN, World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and delegates to the Asia Pacific Conference on Disaster Medicine (APCDM). The meeting identified research questions in five major areas for Health EDRM: health data management, psychosocial management, community risk management, health workforce development, and research methods and ethics. Funding these key research questions is essential to accelerate evidence-based actions during emergencies and disasters."	"In October 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting to identify key research needs, bringing together leading experts from WHO, WHO Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health-EDRM) Research Network (TPRN), World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and delegates to the Asia Pacific Conference for Disaster Medicine (APCDM) 2018. The meeting identified key research needs in five major research areas for Health-EDRM. One of the five major research areas was &quot;Health data collection during emergency and disaster&quot;. Experts for this research area highlighted WHO Emergency Medical Team Minimum Data Set (EMT MDS), a standardized medical data collection method during and after disasters, as an example of substantial progress, with knowledge gaps and challenges in implementation in some regions and countries (i.e., information collection methodology in medical facilities of affected local areas, seamless and practical connection between acute phase data collection and post-acute phase local surveillance). The discussion on this research area also identified key research needs in standardization of broader health-related data to inform effective Health EDRM (i.e., community vulnerabilities, hospital functional status, infrastructure, lifelines and health workforce)."	"In October 2018, at Asia Pacific Conference for Disaster Medicine (APCDM), an expert meeting to identify key research needs was organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) Centre for Health Development (WHO Kobe Centre (WKC)), convening the leading experts from Asia Pacific region, WHO, WHO Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health-EDRM) Research Network (TPRN), World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM), in collaboration with Asia Pacific Conference for Disaster Medicine (APCDM) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). International experts, who were pre-informed about the meeting, contributed experience-based priority issues in Health-EDRM research, ethics, and scientific publication. Two moderators, experienced in multi-disciplinary research interacted with discussants to transcribe practical issues into related methodological and ethical issues. Each issue was addressed in order to progress research and scientific evidence in Health-EDRM. Further analysis of interactive dialogues revealed priorities for action, proposed mechanism to address these and identified recommendations. Thematic discussion uncovered five priority areas: (1) the need to harmonize Health-EDRM research with universal terms and, definitions via a glossary; (2) mechanisms to facilitate and speed up ethical review process; (3) increased community participation and stakeholder involvement in generating research ideas and in assessing impact evaluation; (4) development of reference materials such as possible consensus statements; and (5) the urgent need for a research methods resource textbook for Health-EDRM addressing these issues."	"Tprn encodes the taperin protein, which is concentrated in the tapered region of hair cell stereocilia in the inner ear. In humans, TPRN mutations cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB79) by an unknown mechanism. To determine the role of Tprn in hearing, we generated Tprn-null mice by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 genome-editing technology from a CBA/CaJ background. We observed significant hearing loss and progressive degeneration of stereocilia in the outer hair cells of Tprn-null mice starting from postnatal day 30. Transmission electron microscopy images of stereociliary bundles in the mutant mice showed some stereociliary rootlets with curved shafts. The central cores of the stereociliary rootlets possessed hollow structures with surrounding loose peripheral dense rings. Radixin, a protein expressed at stereocilia tapering, was abnormally dispersed along the stereocilia shafts in Tprn-null mice. The expression levels of radixin and β-actin significantly decreased.We propose that Tprn is critical to the retention of the integrity of the stereociliary rootlet. Loss of Tprn in Tprn-null mice caused the disruption of the stereociliary rootlet, which resulted in damage to stereociliary bundles and hearing impairments. The generated Tprn-null mice are ideal models of human hereditary deafness DFNB79."	"Microtia is a congenital malformation of the external ear caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. However, no causal genetic mutations have been identified in isolated microtia patients. In this study, we utilized targeted genomic capturing combined with next-generation sequencing to screen for mutations in 307 deafness genes in 32 microtia patients. Forty-two rare heterozygous mutations in 25 genes, including 22 novel mutations in 24 isolated unilateral microtia cases were identified. Pathway analysis found five pathways especially focal adhesion pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway were significantly associated with microtia. The low-frequency variants association study was used and highlighted several strong candidate genes <i>MUC4, MUC6, COL4A4, MYO7A, AKAP12, COL11A1, DSPP, ESPN, GPR98, PCDH15, BSN, CACNA1D, TPRN</i>, and <i>USH1C</i> for microtia (<i>P</i> = 2.51 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Among these genes, <i>COL4A4</i> and <i>COL11A1</i> may lead to microtia through focal adhesion pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway which are connected to the downstream <i>Wnt</i> signaling pathway. The present results indicate that certain genes may affect both external/middle and inner ear development, and demonstrate the benefits of using a capture array in microtia patients."	"In order to enhance the positioning capability of terrestrial networks, a novel communication and navigation fusion signal is proposed. The novel signal multiplexes the communication and navigation signal in the same frequency band, and the navigation system is superimposed on the original communication system. However, the application of pseudorandom noise (PRN) sequences in the navigation system is limited by the communication clock period. Taking the application of PRN sequences limited by the clock period as objects, the present study analyzes truncated PRN (TPRN) sequences. PRN sequences with a TPRN sequence as the navigation signal can overcome the communication system clock period limitation. Then, a matched filter algorithm with double detection (MFADD) is proposed to acquire the novel signal. The matched filter method is applied to the proposed algorithm to determine the start code phase of TPRN. Monte Carlo simulations and real data tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the designed signal."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"The TPRN gene encodes taperin, which is prominently present at the taper region of hair cell stereocilia. Mutations in TPRN have been reported to cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness 79(DFNB 79). To investigate the role of taperin in pathogenesis of hearing loss, we generated TPRN knockout mice using TALEN technique. Sanger sequencing confirmed an 11 bp deletion at nucleotide 177-187 in exon 1 of TPRN, which results in a truncated form of taperin protein. Heterozygous TPRN<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed apparently normal auditory phenotypes to their wide-type (WT) littermates. Homozygous TPRN<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited progressive sensorineural hearing loss as reflected by auditory brainstem response to both click and tone burst stimuli at postnatal days 15 (P15), 30 (P30), and 60 (P60). Alex Fluor-594 phalloidin labeling showed no obvious difference in hair cell numbers in the cochlea between TPRN<sup>-/-</sup> mice and WT mice under light microscope. However, scanning electronic microscopy revealed progressive degeneration of inner hair cell stereocilia, from apparently normal at postnatal days 3 (P3) to scattered absence at P15 and further to substantial loss at P30. The outer hair cell stereocilia also showed progressive degeneration, though much less severe, Collectively, we conclude that taperin plays an important role in maintenance of hair cell stereocilia. Establishment of TPRN knockout mice enables further investigation into the function of this gene."	"Bats comprise 20% of all mammalian species and display a number of characteristics, including true flight, echolocation, and a heightened ability to resist viral load that uniquely position this group for comparative genomic studies. Here we searched for evidence of genomic variation consistent with sensory rewiring through bat evolution. We focused on two species with divergent sensory preferences. Myotis davidii is a bat species that echolocates and possesses dim- but not daylight-adapted vision whereas the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) has highly developed day vision but does not echolocate. Using the naked mole rat as a reference, we found five functional genes (CYP1A2, RBP3, GUCY2F, CRYBB1, and GRK7) encoding visual proteins that have degenerated into pseudogenes in M. davidii but not P. alecto. In a second approach genome-wide codon usage bias (CUB) was compared between the two bat species. This CUB ranking systematically enriched for vision-related (CLN8, RD3, IKZF1, LAMC3, CRX, SOX8, VAX2, HPS1, RHO, PRPH2, and SOX9) and hearing-related (TPRN, TMIE, SLC52A3, OTOF, WFS1, SOD1, TBX18, MAP1A, OTOS, GPX1, and USH1G) machinery in M. davidii but not P. alecto. All vision and hearing genes selectively enriched in M. davidii for which orthologs could be identified also were more biased in the echolocating M. lucifugus than the nonecholocating P. vampyrus. We suggest that the existence of codon bias in vision- and hearing-related genes in a species that has evolved echolocation implies CUB is part of evolution's toolkit to rewire sensory systems. We propose that the two genetic changes (pseudogene formation and CUB) collectively paint a picture of that incorporates a combination of destruction and gain-of-function. Together, they help explain how natural selection has reduced physiological costs associated with the development of a smaller eye poorly adapted to day vision but that also contribute to enhanced dim light vision and the hearing adaptations consonant with echolocation. "	"Chloride intracellular channel 5 protein (CLIC5) was originally isolated from microvilli in complex with actin binding proteins including ezrin, a member of the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) family of membrane-cytoskeletal linkers. CLIC5 concentrates at the base of hair cell stereocilia and is required for normal hearing and balance in mice, but its functional significance is poorly understood. This study investigated the role of CLIC5 in postnatal development and maintenance of hair bundles. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy of CLIC5-deficient jitterbug (jbg) mice revealed progressive fusion of stereocilia as early as postnatal day 10. Radixin (RDX), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor Q (PTPRQ), and taperin (TPRN), deafness-associated proteins that also concentrate at the base of stereocilia, were mislocalized in fused stereocilia of jbg mice. TPRQ and RDX were dispersed even prior to stereocilia fusion. Biochemical assays showed interaction of CLIC5 with ERM proteins, TPRN, and possibly myosin VI (MYO6). In addition, CLIC5 and RDX failed to localize normally in fused stereocilia of MYO6 mutant mice. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which these proteins work together as a complex to stabilize linkages between the plasma membrane and subjacent actin cytoskeleton at the base of stereocilia."	"The DFNB79 locus harbors TPRN mutations in which have been reported in a few families with deafness. Four frameshift mutations in TPRN have been described to cause severe or severe-to-profound hearing loss in Moroccan and Pakistani families, and a single frameshift mutation was associated with progressive hearing loss in deaf individuals in a Dutch family. We identified a Pakistani family in which the affected individuals were homozygous for a pathogenic mutation, c.42_52del11, in TPRN (p.G15Afs150X). In contrast to the previously reported individuals affected by the same mutation, hearing loss is likely to be progressive in this family. Thus the same mutation of TPRN can be associated with different thresholds of hearing as well as differences in the stability of the phenotype."	"Targeted genome capture combined with next-generation sequencing was used to analyze 2.9 Mb of the DFNB79 interval on chromosome 9q34.3, which includes 108 candidate genes. Genomic DNA from an affected member of a consanguineous family segregating recessive, nonsyndromic hearing loss was used to make a library of fragments covering the DFNB79 linkage interval defined by genetic analyses of four pedigrees. Homozygosity for eight previously unreported variants in transcribed sequences was detected by evaluating a library of 402,554 sequencing reads and was later confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Of these variants, six were determined to be polymorphisms in the Pakistani population, and one was in a noncoding gene that was subsequently excluded genetically from the DFNB79 linkage interval. The remaining variant was a nonsense mutation in a predicted gene, C9orf75, renamed TPRN. Evaluation of the other three DFNB79-linked families identified three additional frameshift mutations, for a total of four truncating alleles of this gene. Although TPRN is expressed in many tissues, immunolocalization of the protein product in the mouse cochlea shows prominent expression in the taper region of hair cell stereocilia. Consequently, we named the protein taperin."	"We performed genome-wide homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous family from Morocco and mapped the autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in this family to the DFNB79 locus on chromosome 9q34. By sequencing of 62 positional candidate genes of the critical region, we identified a causative homozygous 11 bp deletion, c.42_52del, in the TPRN gene in all seven affected individuals. The deletion is located in exon 1 and results in a frameshift and premature protein truncation (p.Gly15AlafsX150). Interestingly, the deleted sequence is part of a repetitive and CG-rich motive predicted to be prone to structural aberrations during crossover formation. We identified another family with progressive ARNSHL linked to this locus, whose affected members were shown to carry a causative 1 bp deletion (c.1347delG) in exon 1 of TPRN. The function of the encoded protein, taperin, is unknown; yet, partial homology to the actin-caping protein phostensin suggests a role in actin dynamics."	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
"POU3F4"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. In this study, we characterized the clinical features of 12 Chinese Han deaf families in which mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1 were excluded.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 147 known deafness genes was performed in probands of 10 families, while whole-exome sequencing was applied in those of the rest two.Pathogenic mutations in a total of 11 rare deafness genes, OTOF, CDH23, PCDH15, PDZD7, ADGRV1, KARS, OTOG, GRXCR2, MYO6, GRHL2, and POU3F4, were identified in all 12 probands, with 16 mutations being novel. Intrafamilial cosegregation of the mutations and the deafness phenotype were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Our results expanded the mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation of nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese Hans and also emphasized the importance of combining both next-generation sequencing and detailed auditory evaluation to achieve a more accurate diagnosis for nonsyndromic hearing loss."	"During inner ear development, primary auditory neurons named spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are surrounded by otic mesenchyme cells, which express the transcription factor Pou3f4. Mutations in Pou3f4 are associated with DFNX2, the most common form of X-linked deafness and typically include developmental malformations of the middle ear and inner ear. It is known that interactions between Pou3f4-expressing mesenchyme cells and SGNs are important for proper axon bundling during development. However, Pou3f4 continues to be expressed through later phases of development, and potential interactions between Pou3f4 and SGNs during this period had not been explored. To address this, we documented Pou3f4 protein expression in the early postnatal mouse cochlea and compared SGNs in Pou3f4 knockout mice and littermate controls. In Pou3f4<sup>y/-</sup> mice, SGN density begins to decline by the end of the first postnatal week, with approximately 25% of SGNs ultimately lost. This period of SGN loss in Pou3f4<sup>y/-</sup> cochleae coincides with significant elevations in SGN apoptosis. Interestingly, this period also coincides with the presence of a transient population of Pou3f4-expressing cells around and within the spiral ganglion. To determine if Pou3f4 is normally required for SGN peripheral axon extension into the sensory domain, we used a genetic sparse labeling approach to track SGNs and found no differences compared with controls. We also found that Pou3f4 loss did not lead to changes in the proportions of Type I SGN subtypes. Overall, these data suggest that otic mesenchyme cells may play a role in maintaining SGN populations during the early postnatal period."	"In this report, we describe a novel, probably pathogenic hemizygous variant c.870G &gt; T (p.Lys290Asn) in the POU3F4 gene in two deaf brothers from one Italian family with identical inner ear abnormalities specific to X-linked deafness-2 (DFNX2). In addition, we performed homology modeling to predict the effect of the missense variant on the protein structure showing a possible disruption of the normal folding. The identification of pathogenic variants causing X-linked recessive deafness will improve molecular diagnosis, genetic counseling, and knowledge of the molecular epidemiology of hearing loss among Italian individuals. Taken together, we recommend preoperative gene mutation analysis in patients who have DFNX2 diagnosed on the basis of characteristic radiological findings, in order to provide with better prognostic information, the risk of recurrence, and improved rehabilitation options. Finally, the present work strengthens the hypothesis that DFNX-2 could be considered as a syndromic deafness, since mixed hearing loss is associated with other dysfunctions of the neuropsychological profile of the patients."	"The aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of a first-line molecular genetic evaluation approach, in children with deafness.Patients who were found to have sensorineural hearing loss by age-appropriate audiological tests were selected for the molecular genetic evaluation. The molecular genetic evaluation was carried out with GJB2 gene sequence analysis and mtDNA m.1555A&gt;G mutation Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Additionally, in a small group of patients, hearing loss Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis was done out to identify the possible role of copy number changes.In this Turkish cohort, which included 104 index patients and 78 relatives, 33 (31.7%) had Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic variants. One or more GJB2 sequence variants were identified in 46 (44.1%) of the 104 index patients. The homozygous c.35delG mutation by itself explained the etiology in 24% of our ARSNHL group. In one (5%) of the 20 patients of MLPA group, a hemizygous deletion in POU3F4 gene was detected.In our Turkish cohort, we applied a first-line molecular genetic evaluation approach using GJB2 gene sequence analysis and mtDNA m.1555A&gt;G RFLP analysis. This approach revealed the genetic etiology of 44.1% of our index patients. Additionaly, the results of hearing loss MLPA analysis revealed the limited role of copy number changes in this patient group. Furthermore, with a detailed genotype-phenotype association workup, 2 rare cases of Deafness with Palmoplantar Hyperkeratosis and Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome were reported."	"X-linked stapes gusher syndrome is a genetic form of deafness with distinct radiographic features on temporal bone CT. Hypothalamic hamartoma is a congenital glioneuronal anomaly of the hypothalamus. We report a potential association between these two rare anomalies that, to our knowledge, has not been reported. Two brothers presented with sensorineural hearing loss and almost identical inner ear and hypothalamic abnormalities, consistent with a diagnosis of X-linked stapes gusher syndrome and hypothalamic hamartoma. Genetic testing revealed identical mutations in the POU3F4 gene associated with X-linked stapes gusher syndrome. Furthermore, multiple vestibular diverticula were seen in both brothers, which have also not been reported with X-linked stapes gusher syndrome. This case suggests that POU3F4 mediated X-linked stapes gusher syndrome may also lead to multiple vestibular diverticula and hypothalamic hamartoma and, therefore, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be considered in patients presenting with these inner ear findings."	"Patients with X-linked deafness carry mutations in the POU3F4 gene and have pathognomonic inner ear malformations characterised by symmetrical incomplete partition type 3 (absent modiolus and lamina spiralis but preserved interscalar septum in a normal-sized cochlea) and large internal auditory meatus (IAM) with an increased risk of gusher during stapes surgery. We describe a range of fairly characteristic malformations in the hypothalamus of some patients with this rare condition, ranging from subtle asymmetric appearance and thickening of the tuber cinereum to more marked hypothalamic enlargement. We discuss the role of POU3F4 in the normal development of both the inner ear and hypothalamus and the proposed pathophysiology of incomplete partition type 3."	"Inner ear anomalies diagnosed using a radiological study are detected in almost 30% of cases with congenital or prelingual-onset sensorineural hearing loss. Inner ear anomalies can be isolated or occur along with a part of a syndrome involving other systems. Although astonishing progress has been made in research aimed at revealing the genetic causes of hearing loss in the past few decades, only a few genes have been linked to inner ear anomalies. The aim of this review is to discuss the known genetic causes of inner ear anomalies. Identifying the genetic causes of inner ear anomalies is important for guiding clinical care that includes empowered reproductive decisions provided to the affected individuals. Furthermore, understanding the molecular underpinnings of the development of the inner ear in humans is important to develop novel treatment strategies for people with hearing loss."	"<b>                        <i>Aim:</i>                    </b> The aim of this study was to report a novel POU Class 3 Homeobox 4 (<i>POU3F4)</i> variant and to provide further guidance on genetic counseling for incomplete partition (IP) type III families in the Korean population by showing two new contrasting cases in terms of genotypes and inheritance. <b>                        <i>Materials and Methods:</i>                    </b> Two consecutively recruited hearing-impaired probands with seemingly nonsyndromic features and their biological mothers were included in this study.

A <i>de novo</i> genomic deletion on chromosome Xq21.2 was confirmed in another subject via quantitative PCR. This subject's biological mother, however, was not a carrier of this deletion.

"Hereditary deafness is often a neurosensory disorder and affects the quality of life of humans. Only three X-linked genes (POU class 3 homeobox 4 (POU3F4), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1), and small muscle protein X-linked (SMPX)) are known to be involved in nonsyndromic hearing loss. Four PRPS1 missense mutations have been found to associate with X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFNX1/DFN2) in humans. However, a causative relationship between PRPS1 mutations and hearing loss in humans has not been well studied in any animal model. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS-I) is highly conserved in vertebrate taxa. In this study, we used the zebrafish as a model to investigate the auditory role of zebrafish orthologs (prps1a and prps1b) of the human PRPS1 gene with whole mount in situ hybridization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, phenotypic screening, confocal imaging, and electrophysiological methods. We found that both prps1a and prps1b genes were expressed in the inner ear of zebrafish. Splice-blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO1 and MO2) caused exon-2 skip and intron-2 retention of prps1a and exon-2 skip and intron-1 retention of prps1b to knock down functions of the genes, respectively. MO1 and MO2 morphants had smaller otic vesicles and otoliths, fewer inner ear hair cells, and lower microphonic response amplitude and sensitivity than control zebrafish. Therefore, knockdown of either prps1a or prps1b resulted in significant sensorineural hearing loss in zebrafish. We conclude that the prps1 genes are essential for hearing in zebrafish, which has the potential to help us understand the biology of human deafness DFNX1/DFN2.

This significantly hampers the progress toward establishing an effective genetic screening method and early customized rehabilitation modalities for hearing loss. In this study, we evaluated the genetic profile of severe-to-profound hearing loss in a Vietnamese pediatric population using a hierarchical genetic analysis protocol that screened 11 known deafness-causing variants, followed by massively parallel sequencing targeting 129 deafness-associated genes. Eighty-seven children with isolated severe-to-profound non-syndromic hearing loss without family history were included. The overall molecular diagnostic yield was estimated to be 31.7%. The mutational spectrum for severe-to-profound non-syndromic hearing loss in our Vietnamese population was unique: The most prevalent variants resided in the MYO15A gene (7.2%), followed by GJB2 (6.9%), MYO7A (5.5%), SLC26A4 (4.6%), TMC1 (1.8%), ESPN (1.8%), POU3F4 (1.8%), MYH14 (1.8%), EYA1 (1.8%), and MR-RNR1 (1.1%). The unique spectrum of causative genes in the Vietnamese deaf population was similar to that in the southern Chinese deaf population. It is our hope that the mutation spectrum provided here could aid in establishing an efficient protocol for genetic analysis of severe-to-profound hearing loss and a customized screening kit for the Vietnamese population."	"The inner ear is a complex structure responsible for hearing and balance, and organ pathology is associated with deafness and balance disorders. To evaluate the role of epigenomic dynamics, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing at key time points during the development and maturation of the mouse inner ear sensory epithelium (SE). Our single-nucleotide resolution maps revealed variations in both general characteristics and dynamics of DNA methylation over time. This allowed us to predict the location of non-coding regulatory regions and to identify several novel candidate regulatory factors, such as Bach2, that connect stage-specific regulatory elements to molecular features that drive the development and maturation of the SE. Constructing in silico regulatory networks around sites of differential methylation enabled us to link key inner ear regulators, such as Atoh1 and Stat3, to pathways responsible for cell lineage determination and maturation, such as the Notch pathway. We also discovered that a putative enhancer, defined as a low methylated region (LMR), can upregulate the GJB6 gene and a neighboring non-coding RNA. The study of inner ear SE methylomes revealed novel regulatory regions in the hearing organ, which may improve diagnostic capabilities, and has the potential to guide the development of therapeutics for hearing loss by providing multiple intervention points for manipulation of the auditory system."	"The majority of apparently balanced translocation (ABT) carriers are phenotypically normal. However, several mechanisms were proposed to underlie phenotypes in affected ABT cases. In the current study, whole-genome mate-pair sequencing (WG-MPS) followed by Sanger sequencing was applied to further characterize de novo ABTs in three affected individuals. WG-MPS precisely mapped all ABT breakpoints and revealed three possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Firstly, in a t(X;1) carrier with hearing loss, a highly skewed X-inactivation pattern was observed and the der(X) breakpoint mapped ~87kb upstream an X-linked deafness gene namely POU3F4, thus suggesting an underlying long-range position effect mechanism. Secondly, cryptic complexity and a chromothripsis rearrangement was identified in a t(6;7;8;12) carrier with intellectual disability. Two translocations and a heterozygous deletion disrupted SOX5; a dominant nervous system development gene previously reported in similar patients. Finally, a direct gene disruption mechanism was proposed in a t(4;9) carrier with dysmorphic facial features and speech delay. In this case, the der(9) breakpoint directly disrupted NFIB, a gene involved in lung maturation and development of the pons with important functions in main speech processes. To conclude, in contrast to familial ABT cases with identical rearrangements and discordant phenotypes, where translocations are considered coincidental, translocations seem to be associated with phenotype presentation in affected de novo ABT cases. In addition, this study highlights the importance of investigating both coding and non-coding regions to decipher the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in these patients, and supports the potential introduction of low coverage WG-MPS in the clinical investigation of de novo ABTs."	"Many X-linked non-syndromic hearing loss (HL) cases are caused by various mutations in the POU domain class 3 transcription factor 4 (POU3F4) gene. This study aimed to identify allelic variants of this gene in two Chinese families displaying X-linked inheritance deafness-2 (DFNX2) and one sporadic case with indefinite inheritance pattern.Direct DNA sequencing of the POU3F4 gene was performed in these families and in 100 Chinese individuals with normal hearing.There are characteristic imaging findings in DFNX2 Chinese families with POU3F4 mutations. The temporal bone computed tomography (CT) images of patients with DFNX2 are characterized by a thickened stapes footplate, hypoplasia of the cochlear base, absence of the bony modiolus, and dilated internal acoustic meatus (IAM) as well as by abnormally wide communication between the IAM and the basal turn of the cochlea. We identified three causative mutations in POU3F4 for three probands and their extended families. In family 1468, we observed a novel deletion mutation, c.973delT, which is predicted to result in a p.Trp325Gly amino acid frameshift. In family 2741, the mutation c.927delCTC was identified, which is predicted to result in the deletion of serine at position 310. In both families, the mutations were located in the POU homeodomain and are predicted to truncate the C-terminus of the POU domain. In the third family, a novel de novo transversion mutation (c.669 T &gt; A) was identified in a 5-year-old boy that resulted in a nonsense mutation (p.Tyr223*). The mutation created a new stop codon and is predicted to result in a truncated POU3F4 protein.Based on characteristic radiological findings and clinical features, POU3F4 gene mutation analysis will increase the success rate of stapes operations and cochlear implantations, and improve molecular diagnosis, genetic counseling, and knowledge of the molecular epidemiology of HL among patients with DFNX2."	"Sensorineural hearing loss is a very diffuse pathology (about 1/1000 born) with several types of transmission. X-linked hearing loss accounts for approximately 1% - 2% of cases of non-syndromic forms, as well as for many syndromic forms. To date, six loci (DFNX1-6) and five genes (PRPS1 for DFNX1, POU3F4 for DFNX2, SMPX for DFNX4, AIFM1 for DFNX5 and COL4A6 for DFNX6) have been identified for X-linked non-syndromic hearing loss. For the syndromic forms, at least 15 genes have been identified, some of which are also implicated in non-syndromic forms. Moreover, some syndromic forms, presenting large chromosomal deletions, are associated with mental retardation too. This review presents an overview of the currently known genes related to X-linked hearing loss with the support of the most recent literature. It summarizes the genetics and clinical features of X-linked hearing loss to give information useful to realize a clear genetic counseling and an early diagnosis. It is important to get an early diagnosis of these diseases to decide the investigations to predict the evolution of the disease and the onset of any other future symptoms. This information will be clearly useful for choosing the best therapeutic strategy. In particular, regarding audiological aspects, this review highlights risks and benefits currently known in some cases for specific therapeutic intervention."	"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common sensory impairment. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become the standard for the etiological diagnosis of early-onset SNHL. However, accurate selection of target genomic regions (gene panel/exome/genome), analytical performance and variant interpretation remain relevant difficulties for its clinical implementation.We developed a novel NGS panel with 199 genes associated with non-syndromic and/or syndromic SNHL. We evaluated the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the panel on 1624 known single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels on a mixture of genomic DNA from 10 previously characterized lymphoblastoid cell lines, and analyzed 50 Spanish patients with presumed hereditary SNHL not caused by GJB2/GJB6, OTOF nor MT-RNR1 mutations.The analytical sensitivity of the test to detect SNVs and indels on the DNA mixture from the cell lines was &gt; 99.5%, with a specificity &gt; 99.9%. The diagnostic yield on the SNHL patients was 42% (21/50): 47.6% (10/21) with autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (BSND, CDH23, MYO15A, STRC [n = 2], USH2A [n = 3], RDX, SLC26A4); 38.1% (8/21) autosomal dominant (ACTG1 [n = 3; 2 de novo], CHD7, GATA3 [de novo], MITF, P2RX2, SOX10), and 14.3% (3/21) X-linked (COL4A5 [de novo], POU3F4, PRPS1). 46.9% of causative variants (15/32) were not in the databases. 28.6% of genetically diagnosed cases (6/21) had previously undetected syndromes (Barakat, Usher type 2A [n = 3] and Waardenburg [n = 2]). 19% of genetic diagnoses (4/21) were attributable to large deletions/duplications (STRC deletion [n = 2]; partial CDH23 duplication; RDX exon 2 deletion).In the era of precision medicine, obtaining an etiologic diagnosis of SNHL is imperative. Here, we contribute to show that, with the right methodology, NGS can be transferred to the clinical practice, boosting the yield of SNHL genetic diagnosis to 50-60% (including GJB2/GJB6 alterations), improving diagnostic/prognostic accuracy, refining genetic and reproductive counseling and revealing clinically relevant undiagnosed syndromes."	"<b>Objective:</b>The next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) was used to perform genetic testing on children diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in outpatient clinics.The information on the status and inheritance of disease causing genes in deafness was analyzed to provide a theoretical basis for genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and birth defects prevention.<b>Method:</b>Ninety-four cases of sensorineural deafness diagnosed by medical history, audiological examination, and imaging examination were collected in our department.Next-generation sequencing was used to detect the region of exons of 159 genes, 6 mitochondrial genes, and 3 miRNAs related to deafness. The Sanger sequencing verification was performed on the parents of the probands to find out the gene expression status and relationship between the probands and the parents.<b>Result:</b>Of the 94 children with deafness,70 had severe sensorineural hearing loss, 13 had moderate to severe hearing loss, 8 had moderate hearing loss, and 3 had mild hearing loss.Twenty-three cases of cariogenic mutations were detected by next generation sequencing,and the total mutation rate was 24.5%. There were 11 cases of GJB2 mutations, including 6 homozygous mutations of 235delC, 4 heterozygous mutations of 235delC and 299_300del heterozygous mutation of 235delC and c.176_191del.There are 5 cases of SLC26A4 gene mutations, including 2 cases of homozygous mutations of c.919-2A&gt; G, one case of c.919-2A&gt; G and c.2168A&gt;G compound heterozygous mutations, c.919-2A&gt; G and c.754T&gt; C compound heterozygous mutation in 1 case, c.919 2A&gt; G and c.416-418del complex heterozygous mutation in 1 case. There were 2 cases of MT RNR1 mutations, and 1 case of STRC,KCNQ1,USH2A,POU3F4, and MITF mutations.<b>Conclusion:</b>The next-generation sequencing has features such as rapid, high throughput, and low cost, which is beneficial to medication guidance, genetic counseling, and marriage and parenting guidance,and help to effectively prevent or reduce the occurrence of hereditary deafness.."	"The POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) genes encode a large transcription factor family comprising 6 classes (pou1f to pou6f ) involved in many developmental processes, such as cell commitment and differentiation. The pou3f class contains four members (pou3f1, pou3f2, pou3f3, pou3f4) characterized by expression in ectodermal tissue derivatives, such as nervous system and otic vesicle, during mammalian development. In order to obtain insights into the potential conservation of this class of transcription factors in vertebrates, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis and a comprehensive comparative study of pou3f expression in the frog Xenopus laevis. All vertebrates examined possessed members of the four pou3f subfamilies, excepting the zebrafish, which lacked a pou3f4 gene. Whole mount in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses revealed that Xenopus pou3f genes were expressed in the forming neural tube and their expression was maintained in the brain, mostly in the dorsal part, at tailbud stages. The pou3f2, pou3f3, and pou3f4 genes were also expressed in the developing otic vesicle, and pou3f1 in some cells of the epidermis. Besides ectodermal derivatives, pou3f3 and pou3f4 were expressed in the developing kidney. Their expression started at the early tailbud stage in the pronephric anlage and partly overlapped. In the mature pronephric tubule, pou3f3 was restricted to the intermediate tubule, while pou3f4 was also expressed in the distal and connecting tubule. Together, our results highlight a significant conservation of pou3f gene expression in vertebrates and indicate that they may have distinct but also redundant functions during neural and renal development."	"The high-mobility-group domain containing SoxC transcription factors Sox4 and Sox11 are expressed and required in the vertebrate central nervous system in neuronal precursors and neuroblasts. To identify genes that are widely regulated by SoxC proteins during vertebrate neurogenesis we generated expression profiles from developing mouse brain and chicken neural tube with reduced SoxC expression and found the transcription factor prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox1) strongly down-regulated under both conditions. This led us to hypothesize that Prox1 expression depends on SoxC proteins in the developing central nervous system of mouse and chicken. By combining luciferase reporter assays and over-expression in the chicken neural tube with in vivo and in vitro binding studies, we identify the Prox1 gene promoter and two upstream enhancers at -44 kb and -40 kb relative to the transcription start as regulatory regions that are bound and activated by SoxC proteins. This argues that Prox1 is a direct target gene of SoxC proteins during neurogenesis. Electroporations in the chicken neural tube furthermore show that Prox1 activates a subset of SoxC target genes, whereas it has no effects on others. We propose that the transcriptional control of Prox1 by SoxC proteins may ensure coupling of two types of transcription factors that are both required during early neurogenesis, but have at least in part distinct functions.

"Here, we report a novel hemizygous transition c.975G&gt;A (p.Trp325*) in POU3F4 gene (Xq21) found in two deaf half-brothers from one Yakut family (Eastern Siberia, Russia) with identical inner ear abnormalities (&quot;corkscrew&quot; cochlea with an absence of modiolus) specific to X-linked deafness-2 (DFNX2). Comprehensive clinical evaluation (CT and MR-imaging, audiological and stabilometric examinations) of available members of this family revealed both already known (mixed progressive hearing loss) and additional (enlargement of semicircular canals and postural disorders) clinical DFNX2 features in affected males with c.975G&gt;A (p.Trp325*). Moreover, mild enlargement of semicircular canals, postural abnormalities and different types of hearing thresholds were found in female carrier of this POU3F4-variant."	NA
"SMPX"	"nonsyndromic genetic deafness"	"The small muscle protein, X-linked (SMPX) gene encodes a cytoskeleton-associated protein, highly expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscles, as well as in fetal inner ears, with suggested roles as mechanotransductor. Recently, several mutations in the SMPX gene have been associated with X-chromosomal progressive deafness in human. However, very little information is known concerning the roles of SMPX, and no in-vivo models are currently available. Therefore, we characterized the zebrafish ortholog of SMPX to pave the way towards the establishment of a biotool for future functional studies. Despite the genome duplication occurred in the ancestry of teleosts, zebrafish retain only one copy of smpx which shares a high degree of similarity with the mammalian counterpart in terms of genomic organization, syntenic map, and encoded protein. RT-PCR, as well as whole-mount in-situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses, revealed that smpx is expressed in several embryonic areas starting from the 4-somite stage. Specifically, smpx mRNA marked the Kupffer's vesicle (KV), the somites, the myocardium, the hair cells of the anterior and the posterior macula of the inner ear, the pronephric ducts, and the muscles of the branchial arches, eyes and pectoral fins. According to our data, zebrafish smpx expression pattern closely resembles that observed in mouse and human, supporting the notion that zebrafish might represent a suitable in-vivo model to disclose the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of SMPX in development and disease."	"Recessive mutations in GJB2 is the most common cause of genetic hearing loss worldwide. The aim of this study is to determine the spectrum and frequency of GJB2 variants in Chinese Han deaf patients and to investigate the underlying causative genes in patients with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.We analyzed the mutation screening results of GJB2 in 1852 Chinese Han probands with apparently autosomal-recessive hearing loss in our laboratory. Targeted next-generation sequencing of 139 known deafness-related genes were performed in 44 probands with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations.Bi-allelic GJB2 mutations was identified in 25.65% of patients, in which the c.235delC (p.L79Cfs*3) mutation is the most frequent cause for both severe-to-profound (84.93%) and mild-to-moderate hearing loss (54.05%), while the c.109G &gt; A (p.V37I) mutation is another frequent cause for mild-to-moderate hearing loss (40.54%). In 3.89% of patients only one mutant allele can be identified in GJB2. Targeted next generation sequencing in 44 such probands revealed digenic heterozygous mutations in GJB2/GJB6 and GJB2/GJB3 as the likely pathogenic mechanism in three probands. In 13 probands, on the other hand, pathogenic mutations in other deafness-associated genes (STRC, EYA1, MITF, PCDH15, USH2A, MYO15A, CDH23, OTOF, SLC26A4, SMPX, and TIMM8A) can be identified as the independent genetic cause, suggesting that the mono-allelic GJB2 mutations in those probands is likely co-incidental.Our results demonstrated that GJB2 should be a primary target for mutation screening in Chinese Han deaf patients, and those with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations should be further screened by next generation sequencing."	"Mutations in the SMPX gene can disrupt the regular activity of the SMPX protein, which is involved in the hearing process. Recent reports showing a link between nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in SMPX and hearing loss, thus classifying deleterious SNPs in SMPX will be an uphill task before designing a more extensive population study. In this study, damaging nsSNPs of SMPX from the dbSNP database were identified by using 13 bioinformatics tools. Initially, the impact of nsSNPs in the SMPX gene were evaluated through different in silico predictors; and the deleterious convergent changes were analyzed by energy-minimization-guided residual network analysis. In addition, the pathogenic effects of mutations in SMPX-mediated protein-protein interactions were also characterized by structural modeling and binding energy calculations. A total of four mutations (N19D, A29T, K54N, and S71L) were found to be highly deleterious by all the tools, which are located at highly conserved regions. Furthermore, all four mutants showed structural alterations, and the communities of amino acids for mutant proteins were readily changed, compared to the wild-type. Among them, A29T (rs772775896) was revealed as the most damaging nsSNP, which caused significant structural deviation of the SMPX protein, as a result reducing the binding affinity to other functional partners. These findings reflect the computational insights into the deleterious role of nsSNPs in SMPX, which might be helpful for subjecting wet-lab confirmatory analysis."	"X-linked deafness-4 (DFNX4) caused by functional loss of SMPX is a nonsyndromic form of progressive hearing loss with post-lingual onset. Herein, we describe a male neonate from an ethnic Han Chinese family who presented with congenital deafness.The proband and the family members were subjected to comprehensively hearing screen. Genetic testing was carried out using whole-exome sequencing (WES). The result was verified by Sanger sequencing. Functional characterization of the identified variant was completed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), Sanger sequencing, and fluorogenic quantitative PCR (qPCR).The proband was diagnosed with progressive sensorineural hearing loss. The proband's mother showed normal hearing at present. The proband's maternal grandmother exhibited mild HL since the age of 50. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified a donor splice-site variant (NM_014332.2: c.132 + 1G&gt;A) in the SMPX gene in the proband. The mother and maternal grandmother were both carriers, which suggested a X-linked inheritance of the condition in the family. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing revealed that four alternative splice pairs within intron 3 have led to four aberrant RNAs transcripts, including two non-canonical splice-pairs (GC-AG and CT-AG). The variant generated a novel frameshift variant, creating a premature termination codon (PTC) upstream of a newly formed splice site (p.Met45Glyfs*16). SMPX mRNA expression assay showed that the PTC has caused degradation of mRNA via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).This is the first study to report a SMPX (DFNX4) splicing variant in a Chinese family. These findings, especially congenital deafness, contributed to existing knowledge regarding the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of SMPX-associated hearing loss."	"Hereditary deafness is often a neurosensory disorder and affects the quality of life of humans. Only three X-linked genes (POU class 3 homeobox 4 (POU3F4), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1), and small muscle protein X-linked (SMPX)) are known to be involved in nonsyndromic hearing loss. Four PRPS1 missense mutations have been found to associate with X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFNX1/DFN2) in humans. However, a causative relationship between PRPS1 mutations and hearing loss in humans has not been well studied in any animal model. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS-I) is highly conserved in vertebrate taxa. In this study, we used the zebrafish as a model to investigate the auditory role of zebrafish orthologs (prps1a and prps1b) of the human PRPS1 gene with whole mount in situ hybridization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, phenotypic screening, confocal imaging, and electrophysiological methods. We found that both prps1a and prps1b genes were expressed in the inner ear of zebrafish. Splice-blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO1 and MO2) caused exon-2 skip and intron-2 retention of prps1a and exon-2 skip and intron-1 retention of prps1b to knock down functions of the genes, respectively. MO1 and MO2 morphants had smaller otic vesicles and otoliths, fewer inner ear hair cells, and lower microphonic response amplitude and sensitivity than control zebrafish. Therefore, knockdown of either prps1a or prps1b resulted in significant sensorineural hearing loss in zebrafish. We conclude that the prps1 genes are essential for hearing in zebrafish, which has the potential to help us understand the biology of human deafness DFNX1/DFN2.

This model has been used to study the neurological disorder of trigeminovascular pain or migraine, a debilitating form of hyperalgesia. The present study validates hyperalgesia in an established mouse model of chronic migraine triggered by NTG and advances the understanding of the associated molecular mechanisms. The RNA-seq profiles of two nervous system regions associated with pain, the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), were compared in mice receiving chronic NTG treatment relative to control (CON) mice. Among the 109 genes that exhibited an NTG treatment-by-region interaction, solute carrier family 32 (GABA vesicular transporter) member 1 (<i>Slc32a1</i>) and preproenkephalin <i>(Penk</i>) exhibited reversal of expression patterns between the NTG and CON groups. Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (<i>Erbb4</i>) and solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter) member 2 (<i>Slc1a2</i>) exhibited consistent differential expression between treatments across regions albeit at different magnitude. Period circadian clock 1 (<i>Per1</i>) was among the 165 genes that exhibited significant NTG treatment effect. Biological processes disrupted by NTG in a region-specific manner included adaptive and innate immune responses; whereas glutamatergic and dopaminergic synapses and rhythmic process were disrupted in both regions. Regulatory network reconstruction highlighted the widespread role of several transcription factors (including <i>Snrnp70, Smad1, Pax6, Cebpa</i>, and <i>Smpx</i>) among the NTG-disrupted target genes. These results advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of hyperalgesia that can be applied to therapies to ameliorate chronic pain and migraine."	"Hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss is extremely heterogeneous and an X-linked form accounts for 1-5% of all cases. The aim of this study was to identify the pathogenic variants in a nonsyndromic X-linked dominant hearing loss family, and explain the reason of different hearing phenotype in hearing between the two sisters with the same variant.Targeted gene capture and next-generation sequencing were used to study the genetic cause. What's more, methylation differences among the androgen receptor genes were used to investigate whether the different hearing levels of the two sisters is related to X-chromosome inactivation (Xi).We identified SMPX c.29insA (p.Asn10Lysfs*3) as the novel variant causing deafness. The skewed X-chromosome inactivation was relevant to the hearing difference between the two sisters.Targeted gene capture and NGS is an efficient way to identify pathogenic variants in genes. Analysis of X-chromosome inactivation is beneficial to the diagnosis and genetic counseling of X-linked dominant hearing loss families."	"Sensorineural hearing loss is a very diffuse pathology (about 1/1000 born) with several types of transmission. X-linked hearing loss accounts for approximately 1% - 2% of cases of non-syndromic forms, as well as for many syndromic forms. To date, six loci (DFNX1-6) and five genes (PRPS1 for DFNX1, POU3F4 for DFNX2, SMPX for DFNX4, AIFM1 for DFNX5 and COL4A6 for DFNX6) have been identified for X-linked non-syndromic hearing loss. For the syndromic forms, at least 15 genes have been identified, some of which are also implicated in non-syndromic forms. Moreover, some syndromic forms, presenting large chromosomal deletions, are associated with mental retardation too. This review presents an overview of the currently known genes related to X-linked hearing loss with the support of the most recent literature. It summarizes the genetics and clinical features of X-linked hearing loss to give information useful to realize a clear genetic counseling and an early diagnosis. It is important to get an early diagnosis of these diseases to decide the investigations to predict the evolution of the disease and the onset of any other future symptoms. This information will be clearly useful for choosing the best therapeutic strategy. In particular, regarding audiological aspects, this review highlights risks and benefits currently known in some cases for specific therapeutic intervention."	"X-linked inheritance is very rare and is estimated to account for only 1-5% of all nonsyndromic hearing loss cases. We found a multiplex family from China segregating with X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss. After exclusive analysis of 10 common variations of three hearing loss-related genes, GJB2, mtDNA12srRNA and SLC26A4, a novel truncated variant of SMPX, c.87dupA (p.Gly30Argfs*12) (NCBI ClinVar Submission ID: SUB3136126), was identified by whole-exome sequencing. This variant was co-segregated with hearing loss in the entire family and was absent in 576 unrelated ethnically and geographically matched controls. We also detected a single nucleotide variation in two male controls with normal hearing, SMPX c.55A&gt;G (p.Asn19Asp), which has been annotated as a rare variant in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (dbSNP) (rs759552778) and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) databases. This study has enriched the mutation spectrum of the SMPX gene."	"X-linked nonsyndromic hearing impairment is the rarest form of genetic hearing loss and represents only a minor fraction of all cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the cause of X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss in a three-generation American family.Whole-exome sequencing and co-segregation analysis were used to identify disease-causing genes.In this study, we described in detail the clinical characteristics of the family and identified a novel frameshift mutation creating a premature stop codon (c.133-1 G &gt; A, p.(Gly45fs*36)) of SMPX. The loss-of-function mutation was co-segregated with the progressive hearing loss phenotype and was absent in 200 normal controls.We report the first SMPX (DFNX4) mutation in a North American family. Our findings contribute to the existing genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of SMPX associated hearing loss. Furthermore, our data suggest that exome sequencing is promising in the genetic diagnosis of hearing loss."	"This overview focuses on the clinical features and molecular genetics of common syndromic and nonsyndromic types of hereditary hearing loss. The goals of this overview on hereditary hearing loss and deafness are the following: GOAL 1: Describe the clinical characteristics of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 2: Review the causes of hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 3: Provide an evaluation strategy to identify the genetic cause of hereditary hearing loss and deafness in a proband (when possible). GOAL 4: Inform genetic counseling of family members of an individual with hereditary hearing loss and deafness. GOAL 5: Review management of hereditary hearing loss and deafness."	"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are important for tumor initiation and promotion. CSL, a transcriptional repressor and Notch mediator, suppresses CAF activation. Like CSL, ATF3, a stress-responsive transcriptional repressor, is down-modulated in skin cancer stromal cells, and <i>Atf3</i> knockout mice develop aggressive chemically induced skin tumors with enhanced CAF activation. Even at low basal levels, ATF3 converges with CSL in global chromatin control, binding to few genomic sites at a large distance from target genes. Consistent with this mode of regulation, deletion of one such site 2 Mb upstream of <i>IL6</i> induces expression of the gene. Observed changes are of translational significance, as bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors, unlinking activated chromatin from basic transcription, counteract the effects of ATF3 or CSL loss on global gene expression and suppress CAF tumor-promoting properties in an in vivo model of squamous cancer-stromal cell expansion. Thus, ATF3 converges with CSL in negative control of CAF activation with epigenetic changes amenable to cancer- and stroma-focused intervention."	"X-linked hearing impairment is the rarest form of genetic hearing loss (HL) and represents only a minor fraction of all cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the cause of X-linked inherited sensorineural HL in a four-generation Chinese family. A novel duplication variant (c.217dupA, p.Ile73Asnfs*5) in SMPX was identified by whole-exome sequencing. The frameshift mutation predicted to result in the premature truncation of the SMPX protein was co-segregated with the HL phenotype and was absent in 295 normal controls. Subpopulation screening of the coding exons and flanking introns of SMPX was further performed for 338 Chinese patients with nonsydromic HL by Sanger sequencing, and another two potential causative substitutions (c.238C&gt;A and c.55A&gt;G) in SMPX were identified in additional sporadic cases of congenital deafness. Collectively, this study is the first to report the role of SMPX in Chinese population and identify a novel frameshift mutation in SMPX that causes not only nonsyndromic late-onset progressive HL, but also congenital hearing impairment. Our findings extend the mutation and phenotypic spectrum of the SMPX gene."	"The current paper is a continuation of our work described in Rot and Kablar, 2010. Here, we show lists of 10 up- and 87 down-regulated genes obtained by a cDNA microarray analysis that compared developing Myf5-/-:Myod-/- (and Mrf4-/-) petrous part of the temporal bone, containing middle and inner ear, to the control, at embryonic day 18.5. Myf5-/-:Myod-/- fetuses entirely lack skeletal myoblasts and muscles. They are unable to move their head, which interferes with the perception of angular acceleration. Previously, we showed that the inner ear areas most affected in Myf5-/-:Myod-/- fetuses were the vestibular cristae ampullaris, sensitive to angular acceleration. Our finding that the type I hair cells were absent in the mutants' cristae was further used here to identify a profile of genes specific to the lacking cell type. Microarrays followed by a detailed consultation of web-accessible mouse databases allowed us to identify 6 candidate genes with a possible role in the development of the inner ear sensory organs: Actc1, Pgam2, Ldb3, Eno3, Hspb7 and Smpx. Additionally, we searched for human homologues of the candidate genes since a number of syndromes in humans have associated inner ear abnormalities. Mutations in one of our candidate genes, Smpx, have been reported as the cause of X-linked deafness in humans. Our current study suggests an epigenetic role that mechanical, and potentially other, stimuli originating from muscle, play in organogenesis, and offers an approach to finding novel genes responsible for altered inner ear phenotypes."	"Recent works have highlighted the role of NOR-1 in both smooth and skeletal muscle, and have proposed this nuclear receptor as a nexus that coordinates muscle performance and metabolic capacity. However, no muscle specific genes regulated by NOR-1 have been identified so far. To identify NOR-1 target genes, we over-expressed NOR-1 in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). These cells subjected to sustained over-expression of supraphysiological levels of NOR-1 experienced marked phenotypic changes and up-regulated the skeletal muscle protein X-linked (SMPX), a protein typically expressed in striated muscle and associated to cell shape. By transcriptional studies and DNA-protein binding assays, we identified a non-consensus NBRE site in human SMPX promoter, critical for NOR-1 responsiveness. The expression of SMPX was higher in human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM) than in human VSMC, and further increased in HSMM differentiated to myotubes. NOR-1 silencing prevented SMPX expression in HSMM, as well as their differentiation to myotubes, but the up-regulation of SMPX was dispensable for HSMM differentiation. Our results indicate that NOR-1 regulate SMPX in human muscle cells and acts as a muscle regulatory factor, but further studies are required to unravel its role in muscle differentiation and hypertrophy."	"Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) constitute an endothelial progenitor fraction with a promising interest for the treatment of ischaemic cardiovascular diseases. As soluble CD146 (sCD146) is a new factor promoting angiogenesis, we examined whether sCD146 priming could improve the therapeutic potential of ECFC and defined the involved mechanism.We investigated the effects of sCD146 priming on regenerative properties of ECFC in vivo. In a mouse model of hindlimb ischaemia, the homing of radiolabelled cells to ischaemic tissue was assessed by SPECT-CT imaging. Soluble CD146 priming did not modify the number of engrafted ECFC but improved their survival capacity, leading to an enhanced revascularization. The mechanism of action of sCD146 on ECFC was studied in vitro. We showed that sCD146 acts in ECFC through a signalosome, located in lipid rafts, containing angiomotin, the short isoform of CD146 (shCD146), VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and presenilin-1. Soluble CD146 induced a sequential proteolytic cleavage of shCD146, with an extracellular shedding followed by an intramembrane cleavage mediated by matrix metalloprotease (MMP)/ADAM and presenilin-1, respectively. The generated intracellular part of shCD146 was directed towards the nucleus where it associated with the transcription factor CSL and modulated the transcription of genes involved in cell survival (FADD, Bcl-xl) and angiogenesis (eNOS). This effect was dependent on both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, which were rapidly phosphorylated by sCD146.These findings establish that activation of the proteolytic processing of shCD146, in particular by sCD146, constitutes a promising pathway to improve endothelial progenitors' regenerative properties for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."	"Mechanical factors such as stretch are thought to be important in the regulation of muscle phenotype. Small muscle protein X-linked (SMPX) is upregulated by stretch in skeletal muscle and has been suggested to serve both as a transcription factor and a mechanosensor, possibly giving rise to changes in both fiber size and fiber type. We have used in vivo confocal imaging to study the subcellular localization of SMPX in skeletal muscle fibers of adult rats using a SMPX-EGFP fusion protein. The fusion protein was localized predominantly in repetitive double stripes flanking the Z-disc, and was excluded from all nuclei. This localization would be consistent with SMPX being a mechanoreceptor, but not with SMPX playing a role as a transcription factor. In vivo overexpression of ectopic SMPX in skeletal muscle of adult mice gave no significant changes in fiber type distribution or cross sectional area, thus a role of SMPX in regulating muscle phenotype remains unclear. "	"To describe the inheritance patterns and auditory phenotype features of 3 Canadian families with mutations in 2 X-linked &quot;deafness&quot; genes (DFNX).Audiological, medical, and family histories were collected and family members interviewed to compare hearing thresholds and case histories between cases with mutations in SMPX versus POU3F4.The family pedigrees reveal characteristic X-linked inheritance patterns. Phenotypic features associated with the SMPX (DFNX4) mutation include early onset in males with rapid progression from mild and flat to sloping sensorineural loss, with highly variable onset and hearing loss severity in females. In contrast, phenotypic features associated with the POU3F4 (DFNX2) mutation are characterized by an early onset, mixed hearing loss with fluctuation in males, and a normal hearing phenotype reported for females.The study shows how this unique inheritance pattern and both gender and mutation-specific phenotype variations can alert audiologists to the presence of X-linked genetic etiologies in their clinical practice. By incorporating this knowledge into clinical decision making, audiologists can facilitate the early identification of X-linked hearing loss and contribute to the effective team management of affected families."	"Formation of the metazoan body plan requires a complex interplay of morphological changes and patterning, and central to these processes is the establishment of apical/basal cell polarity. In the developing nervous system, apical/basal cell polarity is essential for neural tube closure and maintenance of the neural stem cell population. In this report we explore how a signaling pathway important for nervous system development, Notch signaling, impacts on apical/basal cell polarity in neural differentiation. CSL(-/-) mouse embryos, which are devoid of canonical Notch signaling, demonstrated a neural tube phenotype consistent with cell polarity and convergent extension defects, including deficiencies in the restricted expression of apical polarity markers in the neuroepithelium. CSL(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, cultured at low density, behaved as wild-type in the establishment of neural progenitors and apical specification, though progression through rosette formation, an in vitro correlate of neurulation, required CSL for correct maintenance of rosette structure and regulation of neuronal differentiation. Similarly, acute pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling led to the breakdown of neural rosettes and accelerated neuronal differentiation. In addition to functional Notch signaling, rosette integrity was found to require actin polymerization and Rho kinase (ROCK) activity. Disruption of rosettes through inhibition of actin polymerization or ROCK activity, however, had no effect on neuronal differentiation, indicating that rosette maintenance is not a prerequisite for normal neuronal differentiation. In conclusion, our data indicate that Notch signaling plays a role not only in differentiation, but also in organization and maintenance of polarity during development of the early nervous system."

"KRAS"	"Noonan syndrome"	"The aim of our study was to investigate the association between driver oncogene alterations and metastatic patterns on imaging assessment, in a large cohort of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma patients.From January 2010 to May 2017, 550 patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with molecular analysis were studied retrospectively including 135 EGFR-mutated, 81 ALK-rearrangement, 47 BRAF-mutated, 141 KRAS-mutated, and 146 negative tumors for these 4 mutations (4N). After review of the complete imaging report by two radiologists (junior and senior) to identify metastatic sites, univariate correlation analyzes were performed.We found differences in metastatic tropism depending on the molecular alteration type when compared with the non-mutated 4N group: in the EGFR group, pleural metastases were more frequent (32% versus 20%; p = 0.021), and adrenal and node metastases less common (6% versus 23%; p &lt; 0.001 and 11% versus 23%; p = 0.011). In the ALK group, there were more brain and lung metastases (respectively 42% versus 29%; p = 0.043 and 37% versus 24%; p = 0.037). In the BRAF group, pleural and pericardial metastases were more common (respectively 47% versus 20%; p &lt; 0.001 and 11% versus 3%; p = 0.04) and bone metastases were rarer (21% versus 42%; p = 0.011). Lymphangitis was more frequent in EGFR, ALK, and BRAF groups (respectively 6%, 7%, and 15% versus 1%); p = 0.016; p = 0.009; and p &lt; 0.001.The application of these correlations between molecular status and metastatic tropism in clinical practice may lead to earlier and more accurate identification of patients for targeted therapy.• Bone and brain metastasis are the most common organs involved in lung adenocarcinoma but the relative incidence of each metastatic site depends on the molecular alteration. • EGFR-mutated tumors preferentially spread to the pleura and less commonly to adrenals, ALK-rearrangement tumors usually spread to the brain and the lungs, whereas BRAF-mutated tumors are unlikely to spread to bones and have a serous (pericardial ad pleural) tropism. • These correlations could help in the clinical management of patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma."	"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells have an exceptional ability to invade nerves through pronounced crosstalk between nerves and cancer cells; however, the mechanism of PDAC cell invasion remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of telomerase-specific oncolytic adenoviruses, OBP-301 and tumor suppressor p53-armed OBP-702, against human PDAC cells. Highly invasive PDAC cells exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) expression independent of KRAS expression; ERK1/2 inhibitor or small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment significantly reduced the migration and invasion of PDAC cells, suggesting that the ERK signaling pathway is associated with the invasiveness of PDAC cells. OBP-702 infection suppressed ERK signaling and inhibited PDAC cell migration and invasion more efficiently than OBP-301. OBP-702 also effectively inhibited PDAC cell invasion even when invasiveness was enhanced by administration of motility stimulators, such as nerve and neurosecretory factors. Moreover, noninvasive whole-body imaging analyses showed that OBP-702 significantly suppressed tumor growth in an orthotopic PDAC xenograft model, although both viruses were equally effective against subcutaneous tumors, suggesting that OBP-702 can influence the orthotopic tumor microenvironment. Our data suggest that oncolytic virus-mediated disruption of ERK signaling is a promising antitumor strategy for attenuating the invasiveness of PDAC cells."	"Breast cancer (BC) incidence is progressively increasing in Egypt. However, there is insufficient knowledge of the acquired somatic mutations in Egyptian BC patients which limit our understanding of its progression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Egyptian cohort to sequence a multiple-gene panel of cancer related genes on BC patients. Four hundred and nine cancer related genes were sequenced in 46 fresh breast tumors of Egyptian BC patients to identify somatic mutations and their frequencies. <i>TP53</i> and <i>PIK3CA</i> were the most top two frequently mutated genes. We detected 15 different somatic mutations in <i>TP53</i> and 8 different ones in <i>PIK3CA</i>, each in 27 samples (58.7%). According to Clinvar database; we found 19 pathogenic somatic mutations: 7 in <i>Tp53</i>, 5 in <i>PIK3CA</i>, and single variants of <i>VHL</i>, <i>STK11</i>, <i>AKT1</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>IDH2, PTEN</i> and <i>ERBB2.</i> We also identified 5 variants with uncertain significance (4 in <i>TP53</i> and 1 in <i>CEBPA</i>) and 4 variants with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity (2 in <i>TP53</i> and 1 in each of <i>APC</i> and <i>JAK3</i>). Moreover, one drug response variant (p.P72R) in <i>TP53</i> was detected in 8 samples. Furthermore, four novel variants were identified in <i>JAK2</i>, <i>MTOR</i>, <i>KIT</i> and <i>EPHB</i>. Further analysis, by Ingenuity Variant Analysis software (IVA), showed that PI3K/AKT signaling is altered in greater than 50% of Egyptian BC patients which implicates PI3K/AKT signaling as a therapeutic target. In this cohort, we shed the light on the most frequently detected somatic mutations and the most altered pathway in Egyptian BC patients."	"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly lethal disease worldwide. The majority of patients receiving targeted therapy or chemotherapy develop drug resistance, while its molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. The plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) exhibited the potential in identifying gene variations and monitoring drug resistance in CRC treatment. In this study, we monitored the ctDNA mutational changes in advanced CRC patients underwent first-line therapy with bevacizumab and cetuximab combined with chemotherapy. The mutation spectrum of 43 patients was established by a 605-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. The baseline measurement shows that genes with the highest mutation frequency were TP53 (74%), APC (58%), KRAS (40%), SYNE1 (33%), LRP1B (23%), TOP1 (23%), and PIK3CA (21%). Mutations in TP53, APC, and KRAS were detected in 29 paired plasma and tissue samples with the consistency of 81, 67, and 42%, respectively. Clinically targetable gene mutations, such as APC, RNF43, SMAD4, BRAD1, KRAS, RAF1, and TP53, were also identified in ctDNA. The overall consistency between ctDNA and tissue samples was 54.6%. Alleviation of mutational burden in BRAF, KRAS, AMER1, and other major driving genes was observed following the first-line therapy. Patients with KRAS and TP53 mutations in tissues appeared to benefit more than the wild-type counterpart. The dynamic change of plasma mutation status was consistent with the tissue tumor burden and was closely correlated with disease progression. In conclusion, ctDNA monitoring is a useful method for molecular genotyping of colorectal cancer patients. Dynamic changes in resistance can be sensitively monitored by gene variation status, which potentially helps to develop treatment strategy."	"Peritoneal spread indicates poor prognosis in patients with serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC) and is generally treated by surgical cytoreduction and chemotherapy. Novel treatment options are urgently needed to improve patient outcome. Clinically relevant cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are of critical importance to therapeutic regimen evaluation. Here, a PDX model was established, by orthotopic engraftment after subperitoneal tumor slurry injection of low-grade SOC, resulting in an early-stage transplantable peritoneal metastasis (PM)-PDX model. Histology confirmed the micropapillary and cribriform growth pattern with intraluminal tumor budding and positivity for PAX8 and WT1. PM-PDX dissociated cells show an epithelial morphotype with a 42 h doubling time and 40% colony forming efficiency, they are low sensitive to platinum derivatives and highly sensitive to paclitaxel (IC50: 6.3 ± 2.2 nM, mean ± SEM). The patient primary tumor, PM, PM-PDX and derived cell line all show a KRAS c.35 G &gt; T (p.(Gly12Val)) mutation and show sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib in vitro (IC50: 7.2 ± 0.5 nM, mean ± SEM) and in the PM mouse model. These preclinical models closely reflecting patient tumors are useful to further elucidate LGSOC disease progression, therapy response and resistance mechanisms."	"Inflammation has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) etiology, but the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and CRC risk is unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between pre-diagnostic plasma CRP concentrations and the risk of clinical and molecular CRC subtypes.We used prospectively collected samples from 1010 matched CRC case-control pairs from two population-based cohorts in Northern Sweden, including 259 with repeated samples. Conditional logistic regression and linear mixed models were used to estimate relative risks of CRC, including subtypes based on BRAF and KRAS mutations, microsatellite instability status, tumor location, stage, lag-time, and (using unconditional logistic regression) BMI.CRP was not associated with CRC risk, regardless of clinical or molecular CRC subtype. For participants with advanced tumors and blood samples &lt;5 years before diagnosis, CRP was associated with higher risk (odds ratio per 1 unit increase in natural logarithm-transformed (ln) CRP 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.73). CRP levels increased over time, but average time trajectories were similar for cases and controls (Pinteraction=0.19).Our results do not support intertumoral heterogeneity as an explanation for previous inconsistent findings regarding the role of CRP in CRC etiology. The possible association in the subgroup with advanced tumors and shorter follow-up likely reflects undiagnosed cancer at baseline.Future efforts to establish the putative role of chronic, low-grade inflammation in CRC development will need to address the complex relationship between systemic inflammatory factors and tumor microenvironment, and might consider larger biomarker panels than CRP alone."	"Occurrence at a younger age has been demonstrated to be associated with a distinct biology in non-small cell lung cancer. However, genomics and clinical characteristics among younger patients with lung adenocarcinoma remain to be determined. Here we studied the potentially targetable genetic alterations by next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay in young Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma.Eighty-nine surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples from patients aged less than 45 years were collected with informed consent from all patients. Targeted NGS assays were used to identify actionable genetic alterations in the cancer tissues. Additionally, the genomic and clinical pathologic characteristics of 95 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who received NGS testing over the same period were analyzed retrospectively.The frequencies of targetable genetic alterations in 184 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed by defined age categories, which unveiled a distinctive molecular profile in the younger group, aged less than 45 years. Notably, higher frequency of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) genetic alterations were associated with young age. However, a reverse trend was observed for kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 mutations, which were more frequently identified in the older group, aged more than 45 years. Furthermore, concurrent EGFR/tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations were much more prevalent in the younger patients (81.6% vs 44.9%), which might have a poor response to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).NGS assay revealed a distinctive genetic profile in younger patients with adenocarcinoma. High frequency of concurrent EGFR/TP53 mutations was found in the younger patients, which especially warranted personalized treatment in this population."	"【中文题目：中国年轻肺腺癌患者基因特点研究】 【中文摘要：背景与目的 全球肺癌的发病率正呈逐年上升趋势，其中腺癌所占的百分比日益升高。据统计，全球的肺癌平均初诊年龄在70岁左右，虽然肺癌仍以老年患者居多，但发病年龄的年轻化趋势愈加明显。结合现有研究数据，我们已知在非小细胞肺癌中，年轻患者疾病的发生有其独特的生物学特点。但年轻肺腺癌患者的基因组学特性和临床特征仍有待确定。本研究采用高通量测序（next-generation sequencing technology, NGS）技术对中国年轻肺腺癌患者的基因突变状态进行了研究。方法 共收集了89例年龄≤45岁的肺腺癌患者组织标本，所有患者均知情同意。使用NGS检测用于确定癌组织中驱动基因突变。此外，对同期行NGS检测的95例&gt;45岁肺腺癌患者的基因组和临床病理特征进行回顾性分析。结果 根据年龄分类对184例肺腺癌患者的驱动基因突变频率进行了分析，揭示了年龄≤45岁的年轻组患者的独特基因特征。其中间变淋巴瘤激酶（anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK）融合基因和人表皮生长因子受体-2（human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HER2）基因的突变频率较高。而鼠类肉瘤病毒癌基因（kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene, KRAS）、丝氨酸/苏氨酸蛋白激酶11（serine/threonine kinase 11, STK11）和表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）20外显子突变的趋势则相反，这些突变在年龄&gt;45岁的老年组中更为常见。此外，年轻组EGFR基因突变同时伴有肿瘤蛋白p53（tumor protein p53, TP53）基因突变较老年组更为普遍（81.6% vs 44.9%），这可能使其应用EGFR酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI）后疗效较差。结论 NGS分析显示年轻腺癌患者具有独特的基因突变特点。在年轻患者中发现EGFR/TP53共突变的频率较高，这些独特的基因组学特征对临床治疗有重要的指导意义。】 【中文关键词：肺腺癌；年轻；高通量测序；基因图谱】.Pancreatic cancer represents one of the most lethal disease worldwide but still orphan of a molecularly driven therapeutic approach, although many genomic and transcriptomic classifications have been proposed over the years. Clinical heterogeneity is a hallmark of this disease, as different patients show different responses to the same therapeutic regimens. However, genomic analyses revealed quite a homogeneous disease picture, with very common mutations in four genes only (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4) and a long tail of other mutated genes, with doubtful pathogenic meaning. Even bulk transcriptomic classifications could not resolve this great heterogeneity, as many informations related to small cell populations within cancer tissue could be lost. At the same time, single cell analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to dissect intratumoral heterogeneity like never before, with possibility of generating a new disease taxonomy at unprecedented molecular resolution. In this review, we summarize the most relevant genomic, bulk and single-cell transcriptomic classifications of pancreatic cancer, and try to understand how novel technologies, like single cell analysis, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for this highly lethal disease."	"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignant thyroid neoplasm comprising 80-90% of all thyroid malignancies. Molecular changes in thyroid follicular cells are likely associated with the development of PTC. Mutations in serine/threonine-protein kinase (BRAF) and Rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) are commonly seen in PTC.In total, 90 cases of PTC are randomly selected from archive paraffin blocks and 10μm sections were cut and processed for DNA extraction. BRAF V600E mutation and 8 types of KRAS mutations were investigated using Real Time PCR.BRAF V600E mutation was identified in 46% of PTC while KRAS mutations were seen in 11% of PTC. There was significant correlation between BRAF V600E mutation and PTC larger than 5cm in diameter, positive surgical margin and lymph node metastasis. BRAF V600E mutation was significantly higher in patients with less than 55-year of age than those more than 55-year of age. BRAF V600E mutation was significantly higher in patients with family history of thyroid cancer than those without. There was no significant difference in BRAFV600E mutation between males and females, PTC classic and follicular variants, unifocal and multifocal PTC. There was a significant higher percentage of BRAF V600E mutation in classic PTC than papillary microcarcinoma variant. There was no significant age, gender, histologic type, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, tumor focality, and surgical margin status differences between KRAS mutated and non-mutated PTC.BRAF V600E and KRAS mutation are seen in a significant number of PTC in the UAE. BRAF mutation is significantly correlated with large tumor size, positive surgical margins and lymph node metastasis suggesting an association between BRAF V600E mutation and tumor growth and spread."	"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains a disease with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Identification of driver genetic alterations may lead to the discovery of more effective targeted therapies. CCAs harboring <i>FGFR2</i> fusions have recently demonstrated promising responses to FGFR inhibitors, highlighting their potential relevance as predictive biomarkers. CCA incidence is high in the northeast of Thailand and its neighboring countries because of chronic infection with the liver fluke <i>Opisthorchis viverrini</i> (Ov). However, there are currently no available data on the prevalence of <i>FGFR</i> alterations in fluke-associated CCA in endemic countries.In this study, we performed anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction target enrichment RNA sequencing of <i>FGFR1-3</i>, validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and Sanger sequencing, in 121 Ov-associated and 95 non-Ov-associated CCA tumors.Compared with non-fluke-associated CCA (11/95; 11.6%), <i>FGFR2</i> fusions were significantly less common in fluke-associated CCA (1/121; 0.8%; <i>P</i> = .0006). All <i>FGFR</i> fusions were detected exclusively in intrahepatic CCAs and were mutually exclusive with <i>KRAS/ERBB2/BRAF/FGFR</i> mutations, pointing to their potential roles as oncogenic drivers.<i>FGFR2</i> fusions are rare in fluke-associated CCA, underscoring how distinct etiologies may affect molecular landscapes in tumors and highlighting the need to discover other actionable genomic alterations in endemic fluke-associated CCA."	"Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues used for routine pathological diagnosis are valuable for cancer genomic analysis; however, the association between mutation status derived from these specimens and prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear. We analyzed 50 cancer-related gene mutations including driver genes in PDAC, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to clarify the association between gene mutations and prognosis. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissues obtained from 74 patients with untreated resectable PDAC who underwent surgery at our institution between 2013 and 2018. Fifty of the 74 patients with DNA extracts from FFPE samples suitable for NGS, were analyzed. The prevalence of driver gene mutations was as follows: 84% for KRAS, 62% for TP53, 32% for SMAD4, and 18% for CDKN2A. There were no cases of single SMAD4 mutations; its rate of coincidence with KRAS or TP53 mutations was 30% and 2%, respectively. The combination of KRAS and SMAD4 mutations resulted in significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS; median survival time (MST): 12.3 vs. 28.9 months, P = 0.014) and overall survival (OS; MST: 22.3 months vs. not reached, P = 0.048). On multivariate analysis, the combination of KRAS and SMAD4 mutations was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (hazard ratio (HR) 4.218; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77-10.08; P = 0.001) and OS (HR 6.730; 95% CI 1.93-23.43; P = 0.003). The combination of KRAS and SMAD4 mutations in DNA obtained from FFPE tissues is an independent poor prognostic factor in PDAC."	"Dual inhibition of PI3K and MAPK signaling is conceptually a promising anticancer therapy.This phase 1b trial investigated the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose, pharmacokinetics, tumor response, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) pharmacodynamics, and biomarker explorations for the combination of pan-PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and allosteric MEK inhibitor refametinib in patients with advanced solid tumors.This was an adaptive trial with eight dose cohorts combining dose escalation and varying schedules in repeated 28-day cycles. Patients received copanlisib (0.2-0.8 mg/kg intravenously) intermittently (days 1, 8, 15) or weekly (days 1, 8, 15, 22) each cycle, and refametinib (30-50 mg twice daily orally) continuously or 4 days on/3 days off. Patients with KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or PI3KCA mutations were eligible for the expansion cohort.In the dose-escalation (n = 49) and expansion (n = 15) cohorts, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events included diarrhea (59.4%), nausea, acneiform rash, and fatigue (51.6% each). Dose-limiting toxicities included oral mucositis (n = 4), increased alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (n = 3), rash acneiform, hypertension (n = 2 each), and diarrhea (n = 1). MTD was copanlisib 0.4 mg/kg weekly and refametinib 30 mg twice daily. No pharmacokinetic interactions were identified. Decreased tumor FDG uptake and MEK-ERK signaling inhibition were demonstrated during treatment. Best response was stable disease (n = 21); median treatment duration was 6 weeks.Despite sound rationale and demonstrable pharmacodynamic tumor activity in relevant tumor populations, a dose and schedule could not be identified for this drug combination that was both tolerable and offered clear efficacy in the population assessed. CLINICALTRIALS.NCT01392521."	"Aberrant KRAS signaling is a driver of many cancers and yet remains an elusive target for drug therapy. The nuclease hypersensitive element of the KRAS promoter has been reported to form secondary DNA structures called G-quadruplexes (G4s) which may play important roles in regulating KRAS expression, and has spurred interest in structural elucidation studies of the KRAS G-quadruplexes. Here, we report the first high-resolution crystal structure (1.6 Å) of a KRAS G-quadruplex as a 5'-head-to-head dimer with extensive poly-A π-stacking interactions observed across the dimer. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the poly-A π-stacking interactions are also maintained in the G4 monomers. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations with two G4 ligands that display high stabilization of the KRAS G4 indicated the poly-A loop was a binding site for these ligands in addition to the 5'-G-tetrad. Given sequence and structural variability in the loop regions provide the opportunity for small-molecule targeting of specific G4s, we envisage this high-resolution crystal structure for the KRAS G-quadruplex will aid in the rational design of ligands to selectively target KRAS."	"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer characterized by increased mortality. Here, we show for the first time that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor superfamily, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cSCC. Our data demonstrate that the overexpression of the constitutively active, mutated ALK, <i>ALK</i><sup>                        <i>F1174L</i>                    </sup> , is sufficient to initiate the development of cSCC and is 100% penetrant. Moreover, we show that cSCC development upon <i>ALK</i><sup>                        <i>F1174L</i>                    </sup> overexpression is independent of the cell-of-origin. Molecularly, our data demonstrate that <i>ALK</i><sup>                        <i>F1174L</i>                    </sup> cooperates with oncogenic <i>Kras</i><sup>                        <i>G12D</i>                    </sup> and loss of <i>p53</i>, well-established events in the biology of cSCC. This cooperation results in a more aggressive cSCC type associated with a higher grade histological morphology. Finally, we demonstrate that Stat3 is a key downstream effector of <i>ALK</i><sup>                        <i>F1174L</i>                    </sup> and likely plays a role in <i>ALK</i><sup>                        <i>F1174L</i>                    </sup> -driven cSCC tumorigenesis. In sum, these findings reveal that ALK can exert its tumorigenic potential via cooperation with multiple pathways crucial in the pathogenesis of cSCC. Finally, we show that human cSCCs contain mutations in the <i>ALK</i> gene. Taken together, our data identify ALK as a new key player in the pathogenesis of cSCC, and this knowledge suggests that oncogenic ALK signaling can be a target for future clinical trials."	"Programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) targeted immunotherapy affords clinical benefit in ~20% of unselected patients with lung cancer. The factor(s) that determine whether a tumor responds or fails to respond to immunotherapy remains an active area of investigation. We have previously defined divergent responsiveness of two KRAS-mutant cell lines to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade using an orthotopic, immunocompetent mouse model. Responsiveness to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade correlates with an interferon gamma (IFNγ)-inducible gene signature and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) expression by cancer cells. In the current study, we aim to identify therapeutic targets that can be manipulated in order to enhance cancer-cell-specific MHC II expression.Responsiveness to IFNγ and induction of MHC II expression was assessed after various treatment conditions in mouse and human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines using mass cytometric and flow cytometric analysis.Single-cell analysis using mass and flow cytometry demonstrated that IFNγ consistently induced PD-L1 and MHC class I (MHC I) across multiple murine and human NSCLC cell lines. In contrast, MHC II showed highly variable induction following IFNγ treatment both between lines and within lines. In mouse models of NSCLC, MHC II induction was inversely correlated with basal levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, suggesting potential mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent antagonism of MHC II expression. To test this, cell lines were subjected to varying levels of stimulation with IFNγ, and assessed for MHC II expression in the presence or absence of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors. IFNγ treatment in the presence of MEK inhibitors significantly enhanced MHC II induction across multiple lung cancer lines, with minimal impact on expression of either PD-L1 or MHC I. Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) also enhanced MHC II expression to a more modest extent. Combined MEK and HDAC inhibition led to greater MHC II expression than either treatment alone.These studies emphasize the active inhibitory role that epigenetic and ERK signaling cascades have in restricting cancer cell-intrinsic MHC II expression in NSCLC, and suggest that combinatorial blockade of these pathways may engender new responsiveness to checkpoint therapies."	"The oncogene KRAS is involved in the pathogenesis of many tumors such as pancreatic, lung and colorectal cancers, thereby representing a relevant target for the treatment of these diseases. The KRAS P1 promoter contains a nuclease hypersensitive, guanine-rich sequence able to fold into a G-quadruplex motif (G4). The stabilization of this G4 structure by small molecules is emerging as a feasible approach to downregulate KRAS expression. Here, a set of novel stabilizing molecules was identified through a virtual screening campaign on the NMR structure of the 22-mer KRAS G4. The most promising hits were then submitted to structure-activity relationships studies which allowed improving their binding affinity and selectivity over double helix DNA and different G4 topologies. The best derivative (19) underwent fluorescence titration experiments and further computational studies to disclose its binding mechanism to KRAS G4. Finally, biological assays showed that this compound is capable to reduce the viability of colorectal cancer cells in which mutated KRAS acts as a driver oncogene. Thus, 19 might represent the prototype of a new class of drugs for the treatment of tumors that, expressing mutated forms of KRAS, are refractory to current therapeutic regimens."	"<b>Rationale</b>: <i>KRAS</i> is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in cancers. The protein's picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and smooth protein structure resulting in the absence of known allosteric regulatory sites makes its genomic-level activating mutations a difficult but attractive target. <b>Methods</b>: Two CRISPR systems, genome-editing CRISPR/SpCas9 and transcription-regulating dCas9-KRAB, were developed to deplete the <i>KRAS</i> G12S mutant allele or repress its transcription, respectively, with the goal of treating <i>KRAS</i>-driven cancers. <b>Results</b>: SpCas9 and dCas9-KRAB systems with a sgRNA targeting the mutant allele blocked the expression of the mutant <i>KRAS</i> gene, leading to an inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Local adenoviral injections using SpCas9 and dCas9-KRAB systems suppressed tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. The gene-depletion system (SpCas9) performed more effectively than the transcription-suppressing system (dCas9-KRAB) on tumor inhibition. Application of both Cas9 systems to wild-type <i>KRAS</i> tumors did not affect cell proliferation. Furthermore, through bioinformatic analysis of 31555 SNP mutations of the top 20 cancer driver genes, the data showed that our mutant-specific editing strategy could be extended to a reference list of oncogenic mutations with high editing potentials. This pipeline could be applied to analyze the distribution of PAM sequences and survey the best alternative targets for gene editing. <b>Conclusion</b>: We successfully developed both gene-depletion and transcription-suppressing systems to specifically target an oncogenic <i>KRAS</i> mutant allele that led to significant tumor regression. These findings show the potential of CRISPR-based strategies for the treatment of tumors with driver gene mutations."	"<b>Background and Purpose</b>: RAS mutations limit the effectiveness of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Therefore, new cell death forms have focused on identifying indirect targets to inhibit Ras-induced oncogenesis. Recently, emerging evidence has shown the potential of triggering ferroptosis for cancer therapy, particularly for eradicating aggressive malignancies that are resistant to traditional therapies. <b>Methods</b>: KRAS mutant CRC cell HCT116 and Lovo were treated with cetuximab and β-elemene, a bioactive compound isolated from Chinese herb <i>Curcumae Rhizoma</i>. Ferroptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) were detected <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Orthotopic CRC animal model were established and the tumor growth was monitored by IVIS bioluminescence imaging. Tumor tissues were collected to determine ferroptosis effect and the expression of EMT markers after the treatment. <b>Results</b>: CCK-8 assay showed that synergetic effect was obtained when 125 µg/ml β-elemene was combined with 25 µg/ml cetuximab in KRAS mutant CRC cells. AV/PI staining suggested a non-apoptotic mode of cell death after the treatment with β-elemene and cetuximab. <i>In vitro</i>, β-elemene in combination with cetuximab was shown to induce iron-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, lipid peroxidation, upregulation of HO-1 and transferrin, and downregulation of negative regulatory proteins for ferroptosis (GPX4, SLC7A11, FTH1, glutaminase, and SLC40A1) in KRAS mutant CRC cells. Meanwhile, combinative treatment of β-elemene and cetuximab inhibited cell migration and decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers (Vimentin, N-cadherin, Slug, Snail and MMP-9), but promoted the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin. Moreover, ferroptosis inhibitors but not other cell death suppressors abrogated the effect of β-elemene in combination with cetuximab on KRAS mutant CRC cells. <i>In vivo</i>, co-treatment with β-elemene and cetuximab inhibited KRAS mutant tumor growth and lymph nodes metastases. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our data for the first time suggest that the natural product β-elemene is a new ferroptosis inducer and combinative treatment of β-elemene and cetuximab is sensitive to KRAS mutant CRC cells by inducing ferroptosis and inhibiting EMT, which will hopefully provide a prospective strategy for CRC patients with RAS mutations."	"Vascular smooth muscle aging leads to diabetic complications such as cardiovascular and kidney diseases or diabetic foot. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of smooth muscle cell senescence in a high-glucose (HG) environment is essential. The purpose of this study was to determine whether and how circRNA from human umbilical vein endothelial cell exosomes (HUVEC-Exos) under HG conditions regulates the senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Combining circRNA array analysis and bioinformatics, we postulated that the circRNA-0077930-miR-622-Kras CeRNA network plays an important role in inducing senescence in VSMCs. CircRNA-0077930 transmitted by HG-HUVEs-Exos induced senescence of VSMCs by down-regulation of miR-622 expression and up-regulation of Kras, p21, p53 and p16 expression. Moreover, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was significantly increased while anti-oxidative stress marker (superoxide dismutase, SOD) activity was reduced in HG-HUVEC-Exos treatment VSMCs. Finally, HG-HUVEC-Exos with depleted-circRNA-0077930 is no longer able to induce cellular senescence in VSMCs. These findings provided a new light on the effective treatment of VSMC senescence. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Previous studies have shown that endothelial cell senescence is closely related to smooth muscle cell aging. Here, for the first time, we proved that the HG-HUVECs derived exosomes induced the VSMCs senescence by circRNA0077930-miR622-Kras CeRNA network. The circRNA-0077930-depleted exosomes would lose the ability to promote cellular senescence of VSMCs."	NA

A relevant genetic mechanism can be explained by three mutational events. The first-hit mutation is a germline mutation, and the SMARCB1 mutation on chromosome 22 is the most well-known genetic abnormality in patients with schwannomatosis. LZTR1 is another major predisposing gene in 22q-related schwannomatosis that lacks SMARCB1 variants. Although these two variants account for the occurrence of most familiar schwannomatoses, the genetic causes of sporadic schwannomatosis for the most part remain unknown. Therefore, current molecular diagnostic criteria cannot completely explain the basis of this disease. The common genetic background between schwannomatosis and other related malignant tumors is also unclear. Moreover, it is not easy to explain various clinical manifestations by only two known mutations. QUESTION/PURPOSES: (1) Are there important sequences outside the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 region on chromosome 22 that might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition to sporadic schwannomatosis? Or are there alternative evolutionarily conserved loci that might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition? (2) Is the age of disease onset associated to such genetic variants?This study was a retrospective chart review and prospective genetic study on patients with schwannomatosis who were treated surgically. The clinical criteria to diagnose schwannomatosis were as follows: (1) histologically proven non-vestibular schwannomas; (2) no evidence of vestibular schwannomas on 3-mm brain MRI. A total of 21 patients were treated between March 2006 and June 2015. Since nine patients did not visit the outpatient clinic during the recruitment period, we obtained blood samples from 12 patients with schwannomatosis for a genetic analysis. After two patients were excluded because of their family history of schwannomatosis, genetic analyses were finally performed on 10 patients. Then, those with NF2, SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variants were screened by whole exome sequencing. All 10 patients passed our screening strategy. There were eight men and two women, with a median (range) age of 43 years (24 to 66) at the time of diagnosis. To select candidate genes, common ethnic variants and frequent mutations in in-house exome sequencing data were removed to exclude the population-specific polymorphisms not found in other population and to generalize the findings. Frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site variants were deemed pathogenic. Missense variants were classified as potentially pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance, or benign using in silico (via computer simulation) prediction algorithms, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2), and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD). A variant was considered potentially pathogenic if two or more algorithms predicted the variant to be damaging and benign if none considered it damaging. Then, potentially pathogenic variants only in the genes associated with cancer-predisposition or DNA damage repair were classified as the pathogenic candidate variants of sporadic schwannomatosis. The predictions for pathogenic candidate variants were checked again on Clinical Interpretation of Genetic Variants (InterVar) based on the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines and validated against Mendelian clinically applicable pathogenicity scores (M-CAP scores).We detected 26 variants; 13 variants across 10 genes were predicted to be pathogenic and found in seven patients, two each in ARID1A, PTCH2, and NOTCH2 and one each in MSH6, ALPK2, MGMT, NOTCH1, CIC, TSC2, and CDKN2A. One frameshift deletion in PTCH2 met the criteria for pathogenic or likely pathogenic classification, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Six missense mutations were classified as possibly pathogenic variants based on M-CAP scores. Four predicted pathogenic missense variants were detected in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes. Three DDR genes were affected: ARID1A, MGMT, and MSH6. Among the nine predicted pathogenic mutations detected in known cancer-predisposing genes, one was a frameshift deletion and the others were missense mutations. Seven tumor suppressor genes were involved: PTCH2, ALPK2, CIC, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, TSC2, and CDKN2A. One patient with multiple pathogenic variants in two DDR genes, ARID1A and MSH6, received a schwannomatosis diagnosis at 33 years old. Each of the other patients who had single variants in the DDR gene received their diagnoses at 41 years of age. The age at diagnosis was 40 years or older in patients with variants in cancer-predisposing genes, except for one patient who had multiple variants in TSC2 and CDKN2A. The carrier of those variants received the diagnosis at 24 years old.This study identified first-hit candidate mutations predisposing patients to schwannomatosis that were not related to SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variations in a cohort of patients with sporadic schwannomatosis. Patients with sporadic schwannomatosis without SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genetic variation may have developed the disease because of genomic variants related to cancer initiation in areas other than chromosome 22. Seven of 10 patients had predicted pathogenic germline mutations in DDR and cancer predisposition genes. We detected multiple cancer-related mutations in each patient. The age at the time schwannomatosis was diagnosed might be associated with a combination of variants and characteristics of the genes containing the variants; however, we did not have enough patients to confirm this association.The germline mutations identified in this study and the ideas related to the age of disease onset may provide potential candidate variants for future research on sporadic schwannomatosis and help to revise the current clinical and molecular diagnostic criteria. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed for these variants."	"Intraneural perineuriomas are rare benign neoplasms. The gene associated with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is located on chromosome 22q12, and mutations in <i>NF2</i> are commonly seen in soft tissue perineuriomas. However, an association between <i>NF2</i> mutations and intraneural perineuriomas (INPs) has not been well established. We present a 20-year-old male with NF2, multiple schwannomas and an intraneural perineurioma in the radial nerve at the spiral groove. Sequencing of <i>NF2</i>, <i>SMARCB1</i>, and <i>LZTR1</i> was performed and demonstrated loss of the long arm of chromosome 22 including <i>NF2</i>, <i>SMARCB1</i>, and <i>LZTR1</i>, and a constitutional <i>NF2:c.(-4577_-854)_(45-185)del</i>; alteration. We review the literature supporting two mutually exclusive pathways involving <i>NF2</i> and <i>TRAF7</i> mutations that lead to the development of INPs. ."	"<b>Rationale:</b> Noonan syndrome (NS) is one of the most frequent genetic disorders. Bleeding problems are among the most common, yet poorly defined complications associated with NS. A lack of consensus on the management of bleeding complications in NS patients indicates an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. <b>Objective:</b> Bleeding disorders have recently been described in NS patients harboring mutations of LZTR1, an adaptor for CULLIN3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Here, we assessed the pathobiology of LZTR1-mediated bleeding disorders.<b>Methods and Results:</b> Whole-body and vascular specific knockout of Lztr1 results in perinatal lethality due to cardiovascular dysfunction. Lztr1 deletion in blood vessels of adult mice leads to abnormal vascular leakage. We found that defective adherent and tight junctions in Lztr1-depleted endothelial cells are caused by dysregulation of vesicular trafficking. LZTR1 affects the dynamics of fusion and fission of recycling endosomes by controlling ubiquitination of the ESCRT-III component CHMP1B, whereas NS-associated LZTR1 mutations diminish CHMP1B ubiquitination. LZTR1-mediated dysregulation of CHMP1B ubiquitination triggers endosomal accumulation and subsequent activation of VEGFR2 and decreases blood levels of soluble VEGFR2 in Lztr1 haploinsufficient mice. Inhibition of VEGFR2 activity by cediranib rescues vascular abnormalities observed in Lztr1 knockout mice. <b>Conclusions:</b> Lztr1 deletion phenotypically overlaps with bleeding diathesis observed in NS patients. ELISA screening of soluble VEGFR2 in the blood of LZTR1-mutated NS patients may predict both the severity of NS phenotypes and potential responders to anti-VEGF therapy. VEGFR inhibitors could be beneficial for the treatment of bleeding disorders in NS patients."	"A 67-year-old male presenting with left exophthalmos and progressive visual disturbance was referred to our department. Tumors at the supraclavicular fossa and dorsal femoral region were resected at ages 27 and 45 years. His father and son had both been diagnosed with spinal tumors, and his son's tumor was pathologically diagnosed as a schwannoma. Brain MRI of his son demonstrated no intracranial tumor. Brain MRI of the patient revealed a multilobular tumor of 2 cm diameter compressing the optic nerve medially within the left muscle cone, and no other intracranial tumors. However, large masses lateral to the pharynx and intercostal nerve, as well as multiple spinal tumors were detected. Transcranial total resection of the intraorbital tumor was performed. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with a schwannoma. These clinical characteristics fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of familial schwannomatosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. His visual dysfunction and eye movement disorder resolved completely. The intraorbital tumor was believed to originate from the lacrimal nerve. Sequencing of all exons for &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LZTR1&lt;/i&gt; using DNA extracted from the tumor did not reveal any mutations. This case is the third report on familial schwannomatosis in Japan."	"Cullin 3 (Cul3) family of ubiquitin ligases comprises three components, the RING finger protein RBX1, the Cul3 scaffold, and a Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad complex (BTB) protein. The BTB protein serves as a bridge to connect Cul3 to substrate and is functionally equivalent to the combination of substrate adaptor and linker in other Cullin complexes. Human genome encodes for ~180 BTB proteins, implying a broad spectrum of ubiquitination signals and substrate repertoire. Accordingly, Cul3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, cytoskeleton remodeling, stress responses, and nerve cell functions. Emerging evidence has pointed to the prominent role of Cul3 ubiquitin ligases in cancer. This chapter will describe recent advances on the roles of Cul3 E3 ligase complexes in regulating various cancer hallmarks and therapeutic responses and the mutation/dysregulation of Cul3 substrate adaptors in cancer. In particular, we will focus on several extensively studied substrate adaptors, such as Keap1, SPOP, KLHL20, and LZTR1, and will also discuss other recently identified Cul3 adaptors with oncogenic or tumor-suppressive functions. We conclude that Cul3 ubiquitin ligases represent master regulators of human malignancies and highlight the importance of developing modulating agents for oncogenic/tumor-suppressive Cul3 E3 ligase complexes to prevent or intervene tumorigenesis."	"Variants in the LZTR1 (leucine-zipper-like transcription regulator 1) gene (OMIM #600574) have been reported in recessive Noonan syndrome patients. In vivo evidence from animal models to support its causative role is lacking.By CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated lztr1-mutated zebrafish (Danio rerio). Analyses of histopathology and downstream signaling were performed to investigate the pathogenesis of cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities in Noonan syndrome.A frameshift deletion allele was created in the zebrafish lztr1. Crosses of heterozygotes obtained homozygous lztr1 null mutants that modeled LZTR1 loss-of-function. Histological analyses of the model revealed ventricular hypertrophy, the deleterious signature of Noonan syndrome-associated cardiomyopathy. Further, assessment for extracardiac abnormalities documented multiple vascular malformations, resembling human vascular pathology caused by RAS/MAPK activation. Due to spatiotemporal regulation of LZTR1, its downstream function was not fully elucidated from western blots of adult tissue.Our novel zebrafish model phenocopied human recessive Noonan syndrome and supported the loss-of-function mechanism of disease-causing LZTR1 variants. The discovery of vascular malformations in mutants calls for the clinical follow-up of patients to monitor for its emergence. The model will serve as a novel platform for investigating the pathophysiology linking RAS/MAPK signaling to cardiac and vascular pathology."	"Noonan syndrome (NS, OMIM 163950) is a common autosomal dominant RASopathy caused mainly by gain-of-function germline pathogenic variants in genes involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. LZTR1 gene has been associated with both dominant and recessive NS. Here, we present seven patients with NS and variants in the LZTR1 gene from seven unrelated families, 14 individuals in total. The detection rAte of LZTR1 variants in our NS cohort was 4% similar to RAF1 and KRAS genes, indicating that variants in this gene might be frequent among our population. Three different variants were detected, c.742G&gt;A (p.Gly248Arg), c.360C&gt;A (p.His120Gln), and c.2245T&gt;C (p.Tyr749His). The pathogenic variant c.742G&gt;A (p.Gly248Arg) was found in five/seven patients. In our cohort 50% of patients presented heart defects and neurodevelopment delay or learning disabilities, short stature was present in 21% of them and one patient had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This study broadens the spectrum of variants in the LZTR1 gene and provides increased knowledge of the clinical phenotypes observed in Argentinean NS patients."	"The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is considered the most frequent chromosomal microdeletion syndrome in humans and the second leading chromosomal cause of congenital heart disease (CHD). We aimed to identify the prevalence and the detailed genetic characterisation of 22q11.2 region in children with CHD including simple defects and to explore the genotype-phenotype relationship between deletion/amplification type and clinical data.Patients with CHD for surgery were screened by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and capillary electrophoresis methods. Universal Probe Library technology was applied for validation.In 354 patients with CHD, 40 (11.3%) carried different levels of deletions/amplifications at the 22q11.2 region with various phenotypes. The affected genes at this region include <i>CDC45</i> (15 patients), <i>TBX1</i> (8), <i>USP18</i> (8), <i>RTDR1</i> (7), <i>SNAP29</i> (6), <i>TOP3B</i> (6), <i>ZNF74</i> (4) and other genes with less frequency. Among those, two patients carried 3 Mb typically deleted region from <i>CLTCL1</i> to <i>LZTR1</i> (low copy repeats A-D) or 1.5 Mb deletions from <i>CLTCL1</i> to <i>MED15</i> (low copy repeats A-C). Clinical facial manifestations were found in 12 patients.This study revealed an unexpected high prevalence of chromosome 22q11.2 variations in patients with CHD even in simple defects. The genotype-phenotype relationship analysis suggests that genetic detection of 22q11.2 may become necessary in all patients with CHD and that detection of unique deletions or amplifications may provide useful insight into personalised management in patients with CHD."	"LZTR1 participates in RAS protein degradation, hence limiting the RAS/MAPK cascade. Pathogenic mutations in LZTR1 (MIM:600574) have been described in a few patients with Noonan syndrome (NS). Three patients with LZTR1 mutations of different genetic transmission and NS phenotype are herein characterized.Case 1 is a 5-year-old boy with NS phenotype. Sanger sequencing of PTPN11 and SOS1 identified no mutations. Whole exome sequencing (WES) detected a heterozygous missense mutation in LZTR1:c.742G&gt;A (p.Gly248Arg) (exon 8, Kelch 4 functional domain). Bioinformatic algorithms predict a deleterious effect of this variant, previously described to cause NS. Case 2 is a 4-year-old boy with NS phenotype. Direct sequencing of 8 genes associated with NS identified no mutations. WES localized a homozygous missense mutation in LZTR1:c.2074T&gt;C (p.Phe692Leu, exon 18). This mutation has not been reported before and is predicted to have a deleterious effect on the protein. Case 3 is an 8-year-old boy who shares NS phenotype with his mother. A multigene panel for RASopathies showed a heterozygous missense variant in LZTR1:c.730T&gt;C (p.Ser244Pro) (exon 8; Kelch 4 functional domain) that was maternally inherited. This variant has not been previously described; however, in silico predictors classify it as deleterious. Familial segregation suggests its pathogenicity.The molecular approach for syndromic phenotypes associated with various genes should involve complete/updated panels or WES rather than gene-by-gene sequencing. RASopathy genetic panels should incorporate LZTR1. Patients with pathogenic mutations in LZTR1 exhibit a characteristic NS gestalt but variable cardiac, height, and neurodevelopment expressions, with recessive inheritance possibly associating with a more severe phenotype."	"Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm that may occur <i>de novo</i> or in the context of a previous hematologic malignancy or mediastinal germ cell tumor. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on 21 archival cases of primary histiocytic sarcoma. We identified a high number of genetic alterations within the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway in 21 of 21 cases, with alterations in <i>NF1</i> (6 of 21), <i>MAP2K1</i> (5 of 21), <i>PTPN11</i> (4 of 21), <i>BRAF</i> (4 of 21), <i>KRAS</i> (4 of 21), <i>NRAS</i> (1 of 21), and <i>LZTR1</i> (1 of 21), including single cases with homozygous deletion of <i>NF1</i>, high-level amplification of <i>PTPN11</i>, and a novel <i>TTYH3-BRAF</i> fusion. Concurrent <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i> mutations were present in 3 of 21 cases, and 5 of 7 cases with alterations in <i>NF1</i> and/or <i>PTPN11</i> had disease involving the gastrointestinal tract. Following unsupervised clustering of gene expression data, cases with <i>NF1</i> and/or <i>PTPN11</i> abnormalities formed a distinct tumor subgroup. A subset of <i>NF1/PTPN11</i> wild-type cases had frequent mutations in B-cell lymphoma associated genes and/or clonal IG gene rearrangements. Our findings expand the current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this rare tumor and suggest the existence of a distinct subtype of primary histiocytic sarcoma characterized by <i>NF1/PTPN11</i> alterations with predilection for the gastrointestinal tract."	"Segmental schwannomatosis is characterized by multiple schwannomas affecting one-limb or less than 5 contiguous segments of spine. Its characteristics are not well described in the literature. Our objective was to better describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of this condition.This was a retrospective, bi-center study conducted in two French expert centers for neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis. The clinical, radiographic, pathological and molecular aspects were extracted from patients' clinical records.Twelve patients with segmental schwannomatosis were identified. Eight were female and 4 were male. The median age at initial symptom was 29 years (range: 6-60 years) and the median age at diagnosis was 34.5 years (range: 13-65 years). Pain was the initial symptom for the majority of patients (7 of 12). The number of tumors was variable with six patients having more than 10 tumors. Peripheral distribution was seen in all patients. Quality of life could be impaired (median Dermatology Life Quality Index score was 4.5 (range: 2-13). The median duration of follow up was 3 years (range: 1-26). Chronic pain was the main complication (9 of 12 patients). Surgical intervention to control chronic pain was performed for 9 patients of whom 5 experienced recurrence of tumors. Molecular investigations revealed heterozygous LZTR1 variants in 3 of 9 patients.Segmental schwannomatosis is a rare condition that may start early in life and often remains undiagnosed for many years. Pain is the main symptom and consequently could impair the quality of life. Surgery seems to be effective, but recurrences are frequent. Some patients carried heterozygous LZTR1 variants. Further studies are needed to better understand this rare condition."	"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a schwannoma predisposition syndrome, alongside schwannomatosis related to germline LZTR1 and SMARCB1 pathogenic variants. This review highlights their overlapping phenotypes, new insight into NF2 phenotype and treatment outcomes.Mosaic NF2 is more prevalent than previously thought. Use of next-generation sequencing and tumour testing is needed to differentiate mosaic NF2 and schwannomatosis. Developing NF2 phenotypic insights include vasculopathy with brainstem infarction and vessel stenosis; focal cortical dysplasia in severe phenotypes; swallowing/speech difficulties and continued debate into malignancy in NF2. Proposed are: use of visual evoked potentials to monitor optic nerve sheath meningioma; potential routine magnetic resonance angiogram in adolescence and a genetic score to cohort patients with similar pathogenic_variants, for natural history/treatment outcome studies. Cohort studies found survival analysis to hearing loss and unilateral visual loss in severe mutation groups was 32 and 38 years; active management gave better outcomes than surveillance in spinal ependymoma; gamma knife, bevacizumab and hearing preservation surgery maintained or improved short-term hearing in selected patients, and gamma knife had a good long-term tumour control in mild patients with small tumours.Further long-term outcome studies are needed comparing similar severity patients to allow informed decision making."	"Schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) are two distinct neuro-genetic tumor predisposition disorders, which, however, share some clinical and genetic features. While germline mutations in the NF2 gene are only found in NF2, a majority of schwannomatosis patients have germline mutations in the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genes. The overlapping clinical phenotypes pose a serious challenge in differential diagnosis and in risk stratification of these two entities which is further complicated by frequent mosaicism in both disorders. Chronic neuropathic pain which is a typical consequence of small fiber neuropathy, is characteristic for schwannomatosis. By contrast, NF2 patients do not have chronic pain but may have moderate to severe sensory deficits and paresis which are not characteristic for schwannomatosis. In the present study, we determined intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IEND) in skin biopsies of 34 clinically ascertained schwannomatosis and 25 NF2 patients. In the NF2 group, 11/25 (44%) presented with IEND below the age- and gender-matched bottom 5% normative reference IEND. In contrast, nearly all (33/34 = 97%) schwannomatosis patients showed IEND below or on the bottom 5% normative reference. The reduction of IEND in schwannomatosis patients was age-independent. Paired t-test revealed no difference between the NF2-IEND and the corresponding bottom 5% normative reference (P = 0.98). By contrast, IEND in the schwannomatosis patients were highly significantly lower than the corresponding 5% normative reference IEND (P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, the difference between the IEND of our patients and the 5% lowest normative reference IEND was highly significantly larger in schwannomatosis patients than in NF2 patients (P &lt; 0.0001). IEND of our patients did not correlate with neither the presence nor types of germline mutations in neither the NF2 nor the LZTR1 gene. In conclusion, schwannomatosis patients have marked low IEND which provides a major parameter for diagnosis and differential diagnosis."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by characteristic facies, short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, unusual chest shape with superior pectus carinatum and inferior pectus excavatum, cryptorchidism, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities. Although birth length is usually normal, final adult height approaches the lower limit of normal. Congenital heart disease occurs in 50%-80% of individuals. Pulmonary valve stenosis, often with dysplasia, is the most common heart defect and is found in 20%-50% of individuals. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, found in 20%-30% of individuals, may be present at birth or develop in infancy or childhood. Other structural defects include atrial and ventricular septal defects, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Up to one fourth of affected individuals have mild intellectual disability, and language impairments in general are more common in NS than in the general population.NS is diagnosed on clinical grounds by observation of key features. Affected individuals have normal chromosome studies. Molecular genetic testing identifies a pathogenic variant in <i>PTPN11</i> in 50% of affected individuals, <i>SOS1</i> in approximately 13%, <i>RAF1</i> and <i>RIT1</i> each in 5%, and <i>KRAS</i> in fewer than 5%. Other reported genes – in which pathogenic variants have been found to cause Noonan syndrome in fewer than 1% of cases – include <i>BRAF</i>, <i>LZTR1</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, and <i>NRAS</i>. Several additional genes associated with a Noonan-syndrome-like phenotype in fewer than ten individuals have been identified.<i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Cardiovascular anomalies in NS are usually treated as in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding is guided by knowledge of the specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomaly. Growth hormone (GH) treatment increases growth velocity. <i>Surveillance:</i> Monitoring of anomalies found in any system, especially cardiovascular abnormalities.NS is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. While many individuals with autosomal dominant NS have a <i>de novo</i> pathogenic variant, an affected parent is recognized in 30%-75% of families. The risk to sibs of a proband with autosomal dominant NS depends on the genetic status of the parents: if a parent is affected, the risk is 50%; when the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low (&lt;1%). Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. NS caused by pathogenic variants in <i>LZTR1</i> can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive NS are typically heterozygotes (i.e., have one <i>LZTR1</i> pathogenic variant), and may either be asymptomatic or have mild features of NS. If both parents are heterozygous for one <i>LZTR1</i> pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of having one <i>LZTR1</i> pathogenic variant (which can be associated with mild NS features), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal testing is possible if the NS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member."	"Leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 (LZTR1) encodes a member of the BTB-Kelch superfamily, which interacts with the Cullin3 (CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Mutations in LZTR1 have been identified in glioblastoma, schwannomatosis, and Noonan syndrome. However, the functional role of LZTR1 in carcinogenesis or human development is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that LZTR1 facilitates the polyubiquitination and degradation of RAS via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to the inhibition of the RAS/MAPK signaling. The polyubiquitination and degradation of RAS was also observed in cells expressing MRAS, HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS as well as oncogenic RAS mutants and inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and cell growth. In vivo ubiquitination assays showed that MRAS-K127 and HRAS-K170 were ubiquitinated by LZTR1 and that the polyubiquitinated-chains contained mainly Ub-K48, K63, and K33-linked chains, suggesting its possible involvement in autophagy. Immunoprecipitation analyses showed the interaction of LZTR1 and RAS-GTPases with autophagy-related proteins, including LC3B and SQSTM1/p62. Co-expression of LZTR1 and RAS increased the expression of lipidated form of LC3B. However, long-term treatment with chloroquine had little effect on RAS protein levels, suggesting that the contribution of autophagy to LZTR1-mediated RAS degradation is minimal. Taken together, these results show that LZTR1 functions as a &quot;RAS killer protein&quot; mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regardless of the type of RAS GTPase, controlling downstream signal transduction. Our results also suggest a possible association of LZTR1 and RAS-GTPases with the autophagy. These findings provide clues for the elucidation of the mechanisms of RAS degradation and regulation of the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade."	"To evaluate the incidence of mosaicism in de novo neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2).Patients fulfilling NF2 criteria, but with no known affected family member from a previous generation (n = 1055), were tested for NF2 variants in lymphocyte DNA and where available tumor DNA. The proportion of individuals with a proven or presumed mosaic NF2 variant was assessed and allele frequencies of identified variants evaluated using next-generation sequencing.The rate of proven/presumed mosaicism was 232/1055 (22.0%). However, nonmosaic heterozygous pathogenic variants were only identified in 387/1055 (36.7%). When variant detection rates in second generation nonmosaics were applied to de novo cases, we assessed the overall probable mosaicism rate to be 59.7%. This rate differed by age from 21.7% in those presenting with bilateral vestibular schwannoma &lt;20 years to 80.7% in those aged ≥60 years. A mosaic variant was detected in all parents of affected children with a single-nucleotide pathogenic NF2 variant.This study has identified a very high probable mosaicism rate in de novo NF2, probably making NF2 the condition with the highest expressed rate of mosaicism in de novo dominant disease that is nonlethal in heterozygote form. Risks to offspring are small and probably correlate with variant allele frequency detected in blood."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a common autosomal dominant/recessive disorder. No large-scale study has been conducted on NS in China, which is the most populous country in the world. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify pathogenic variants in patients that exhibited NS-related phenotypes. We assessed the facial features and clinical manifestations of patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. Gene-related Chinese NS facial features were described using artificial intelligence (AI).NGS identified pathogenic variants in 103 Chinese patients in eight NS-related genes: PTPN11 (48.5%), SOS1 (12.6%), SHOC2 (11.7%), KRAS (9.71%), RAF1 (7.77%), RIT1 (6.8%), CBL (0.97%), NRAS (0.97%), and LZTR1 (0.97%). Gene-related facial representations showed that each gene was associated with different facial details. Eight novel pathogenic variants were detected and clinical features because of specific genetic variants were reported, including hearing loss, cancer risk due to a PTPN11 pathogenic variant, and ubiquitous abnormal intracranial structure due to SHOC2 pathogenic variants. NGS facilitates the diagnosis of NS, especially for patients with mild/moderate and atypical symptoms. Our study describes the genotypic and phenotypic spectra of NS in China, providing new insights into distinctive clinical features due to specific pathogenic variants."	NA	NA	NA
"NRAS"	"Noonan syndrome"	"Brain involvement occurs in majority of patients with metastatic melanoma. The potential of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for surveillance and monitoring systemic therapy response in patients with melanoma brain metastases merits investigation.This study examined circulating <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i> and <i>c-KIT</i> mutations in melanoma patients with active brain metastases receiving PD-1 inhibitor-based therapy. Intracranial and extracranial disease volumes were measured using the sum of product of diameters, and response assessment performed using RECIST. Longitudinal plasma samples were analysed for ctDNA over the first 12 weeks of treatment (threshold 2.5 copies/ml plasma).Of a total of 72 patients; 13 patients had intracranial metastases only and 59 patients had concurrent intracranial and extracranial metastases. ctDNA detectability was 0% and 64%, respectively, and detectability was associated with extracranial disease volume (p &lt; 0.01). Undetectable ctDNA on-therapy was associated with extracranial response (p &lt; 0.01) but not intracranial response. The median overall survival in patients with undetectable (n = 34) versus detectable (n = 38) ctDNA at baseline was 39.2 versus 10.6 months (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.28 - 0.94], p = 0.03) and on-therapy was 39.2 versus 9.2 months (HR 0.32 [95% CI 0.16 - 0.63], p &lt; 0.01).ctDNA remains a strong prognostic biomarker in melanoma patients with brain metastases, especially in patients with concurrent extracranial disease. However, ctDNA was not able to detect or monitor intracranial disease activity, and we recommend against using ctDNA as a sole test during surveillance and therapeutic monitoring in patients with melanoma."	"RUNX1 is mutated in approximately 10% of adult AML. Although most RUNX1 mutations in this disease are believed to be acquired, they can also be germline. Indeed, germline RUNX1 mutations result in the well-described autosomal dominant familial platelet disorder with predisposition to hematologic malignancies (RUNX1-FPD, FPD/AML, FPDMM) in which about 44% of affected individuals progress to AML or myelodysplastic syndromes. Using the Leucegene RUNX1 AML patient group, we sought to investigate the proportion of germline versus acquired RUNX1 mutations in this cohort. Our results showed that 30% of RUNX1 mutations in our AML cohort are germline. Molecular profiling revealed higher frequencies of NRAS mutations and other mutations known to activate various signaling pathways in these RUNX1 germline mutated AML. Moreover, two patients (mother and son) had co-occurrence of RUNX1 and CEBPA germline mutations with variable AML disease onset at 59 and 27 years, respectively. Together this data suggests a higher than anticipated frequency of germline RUNX1 mutations in the Leucegene cohort and further highlights the importance of testing for RUNX1 mutations in instances where allogeneic stem cell transplantation with related donor is envisioned."	"Dual inhibition of PI3K and MAPK signaling is conceptually a promising anticancer therapy.This phase 1b trial investigated the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose, pharmacokinetics, tumor response, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) pharmacodynamics, and biomarker explorations for the combination of pan-PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and allosteric MEK inhibitor refametinib in patients with advanced solid tumors.This was an adaptive trial with eight dose cohorts combining dose escalation and varying schedules in repeated 28-day cycles. Patients received copanlisib (0.2-0.8 mg/kg intravenously) intermittently (days 1, 8, 15) or weekly (days 1, 8, 15, 22) each cycle, and refametinib (30-50 mg twice daily orally) continuously or 4 days on/3 days off. Patients with KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or PI3KCA mutations were eligible for the expansion cohort.In the dose-escalation (n = 49) and expansion (n = 15) cohorts, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events included diarrhea (59.4%), nausea, acneiform rash, and fatigue (51.6% each). Dose-limiting toxicities included oral mucositis (n = 4), increased alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (n = 3), rash acneiform, hypertension (n = 2 each), and diarrhea (n = 1). MTD was copanlisib 0.4 mg/kg weekly and refametinib 30 mg twice daily. No pharmacokinetic interactions were identified. Decreased tumor FDG uptake and MEK-ERK signaling inhibition were demonstrated during treatment. Best response was stable disease (n = 21); median treatment duration was 6 weeks.Despite sound rationale and demonstrable pharmacodynamic tumor activity in relevant tumor populations, a dose and schedule could not be identified for this drug combination that was both tolerable and offered clear efficacy in the population assessed.

Previous studies have shown that Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors can inhibit MYCN expression and suppress MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in vivo. Furthermore, alterations within RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling play significant roles in neuroblastoma initiation, maintenance, and relapse, and mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in subsets of neuroblastoma preclinical models. Finally, hyperactivation of RAS-MAPK signaling has been shown to promote resistance to BET inhibitors. Therefore, we examined the antitumor efficacy of combined BET/MEK inhibition utilizing I-BET726 or I-BET762 and trametinib in high-risk neuroblastoma.Utilizing a panel of genomically annotated neuroblastoma cell line models, we investigated the in vitro effects of combined BET/MEK inhibition on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of combined inhibition in neuroblastoma xenograft models.Combined BET and MEK inhibition demonstrated synergistic effects on the growth and survival of a large panel of neuroblastoma cell lines through augmentation of apoptosis. A combination therapy slowed tumor growth in a non-MYCN-amplified, NRAS-mutated neuroblastoma xenograft model, but had no efficacy in an MYCN-amplified model harboring a loss-of-function mutation in NF1.Combinatorial BET and MEK inhibition was synergistic in the vast majority of neuroblastoma cell lines in the in vitro setting but showed limited antitumor activity in vivo. Collectively, these data do not support clinical development of this combination in high-risk neuroblastoma."	"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an accepted etiological factor in cutaneous melanoma (CM), however its role in Uveal Melanoma (UM) is controversial. Partly as a consequence, CM and UM are often considered to be separate conditions, and advances in the treatment of CM have not led to joint clinical trials or parallel improvements in survival of UM. This study hypothesized that a subset of UM tumors display evidence of genetic changes consistent with UV-related damage similar to that shown in CM. Analysis of the Broad Institute's Firebrowse depository of 80 UM samples and 343 CM samples, together with the Sanger Institute's Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer depository of 995 UM and 12,447 CM samples was undertaken to identify the most frequently mutated genes, mutation types and specific nucleotide variants (SNVs) in each condition. Somatic mutation data was cross-correlated and shared mutations assessed against known effects of UV radiation. The proportion of samples with C&gt;T substitutions (a classic genetic marker of UV-related damage) was higher in UM than CM on both DNA strands (17.0% vs 13.1% , p = 0.038). The most frequently encountered cross-correlated mutated genes between UM and CM were, in order, BRAF, NRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, TERT, PTEN, ARID2 and KMT2C, with multiple common BRAF point mutations. Each cross-correlated mutation, and each common point mutation in BRAF, was associated with UV-related mechanistic changes. These findings support the hypothesis that the etiology of a substantial minority of UMs may be more UV dependent than previously recognized."	"Risk of developing myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is significantly increased in both multiple myeloma (MM) and MGUS, suggesting that is therapy independent. However, the incidence and sequelae of dysplastic hematopoiesis at diagnosis are unknown. Here, we used multidimensional flow cytometry (MFC) to prospectively screen for presence of MDS-associated phenotypic alterations (MDS-PA) in the bone marrow of 285 MM patients enrolled in the PETHEMA/GEM2012MENOS65 trial (NCT01916252), and investigated the clinical significance of monocytic MDS-PA in a larger series of 1,252 patients enrolled in four PETHEMA/GEM protocols. At diagnosis, 33/285 (11.6%) cases displayed MDS-PA. Bulk- and single-cell targeted sequencing of MDS recurrently mutated genes in CD34+ progenitors (and dysplastic lineages) from 67 patients unveiled clonal hematopoiesis in 13/26 (50%) cases with MDS-PA versus 9/41 (22%) without MDS-PA; TET2 and NRAS were the most frequently mutated genes. Dynamics of MDS-PA at diagnosis and after autologous transplant were evaluated in 86/285 patients, and showed that in most cases (69/86, 80%) MDS-PA either persisted or remained absent in patients with or without MDS-PA at diagnosis, respectively. Noteworthy, MDS-associated mutations unfrequently emerged after high-dose therapy. Based on MFC profiling, we found that patients with MDS-PA have altered hematopoiesis and Treg distribution in the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, presence of monocytic MDS-PA at diagnosis anticipated greater risk of hematological toxicity and was independently associated with inferior progression-free (HR:1.5, P=.02) and overall survival (HR:1.7, P=.01). This study unveils the biological and clinical significance of dysplastic hematopoiesis in newly-diagnosed MM, which can be screened with moderate sensitivity using cost-effective MFC."	"This study piloted a pan-solid-tumor next generation sequence (NGS)-based laboratory developed test as a diagnostic aid in melanocytic tumors. 31 cases [4 &quot;epithelioid&quot; nevi, 5 blue nevi variants, 7 Spitz tumors (3 benign and 4 malignant) and 15 melanomas] were evaluated. All tumors [median diameter 7 mm (range 4-15 mm); median thickness 2.25 mm (range 0.25-12 mm)] yielded satisfactory results. The number of small nucleotide variants/tumor was significantly different between melanoma (median 18/tumor, range 4-71) and all other lesions (median 8/tumor, range 3-17)(p&lt;0.004) and malignant (median 16/tumor, range 4-71) versus benign lesions (median 7/tumor, range 3-14) (p=0.01). BRAF, MET, NTRK1, and ROS fusions only occurred in benign Spitz tumors; EML4 fusion, BRAF, MAP2K1 and TERT mutations occurred in malignant Spitz tumors and/or melanoma. Amplifications, NRAS, and NF1 mutations only occurred in melanoma. Most melanomas contained &gt;1 pathogenic alteration. Developed NGS-based criteria correctly classified all malignant lesions in this series. 10/12 cases showed concordance with FISH; consensus diagnosis agreed with NGS classification in FISH-non-concordant cases. This pilot study suggests that NGS may be an effective diagnostic adjunct comparable to FISH, but further studies with larger numbers of cases are needed. This article is protected by copyright.

Although prior studies have demonstrated alterations in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in some of these tumors, controversy still exists regarding the nature of the stromal spindle component. We have studied seven cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma with prominent myofibroblastic stroma, including six men and one woman aged 20-65 years (mean age = 44). All cases displayed areas consistent with conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma embedded in abundant myofibroblastic-like stroma. The myofibroblastic stroma in six cases resembled desmoid-type fibromatosis and in one case it more closely resembled nodular fasciitis. By immunohistochemical staining, the stromal spindle component showed positivity for SMA and low MIB1 proliferation index in all cases, and there was at least patchy strong nuclear positivity for beta-catenin in six/seven cases. Stains for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and PAX8 were positive in the epithelial elements but negative in the stromal component. Next-generation sequencing was performed on six of seven cases. CTNNB1 gene mutations were identified in six/seven cases. The epithelial component showed BRAF mutations in two cases and an NRAS mutation in one case. The case with fasciitis-like stroma was negative for beta-catenin by sequencing and immunostaining as well as negative for USP6 gene rearrangement. Our findings indicate that papillary thyroid carcinoma with prominent myofibroblastic stroma may represent more than one category of lesions."	"<b>Purpose</b>: To evaluate the detection of gene mutations in bone marrow biopsy and circulating free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma in multiple myeloma (MM). <b>Experimental design</b>: We used cell-free DNA from plasma and bone marrow to test <i>BRAF V600</i>, <i>KRAS G12/G13</i>, <i>NRAS G12/G13</i> and <i>NRAS Q61</i> mutations using multiplex assays for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), and evaluated results with clinical outcomes. <b>Results</b>: We found of 83 patients, the detectable mutation frequencies for the above four genes were 4 (5%), 13 (16%), 3 (4%) and 14 (17%) in bone marrow, respectively. The median variant allelic frequency (VAF) in most mutations were 1.595%. In 17 paired cfDNA samples, the detectable mutation frequencies for the above four genes were 5 (30%), 1 (6%), 0 (0%) and 3 (18%) respectively, and the median VAF rate was 2.9%. Agreement between bone marrow DNA and plasma cfDNA were 76%, 100%, 100% and 100% compared to the tissue detections, respectively. In 17 patients with paired bone marrow and plasma samples, the above four mutations were 3 (18%), 1 (6%), 0 (0%) and 2 (12%) respectively, with the agreement rates of 88%, 88%, 100% and 100% compared to tissue detections. Of 57 patients with available outcome data, high mutation VAF had a shorter median survival than patients with low mutation VAF (<i>P</i>=0.0322). <b>Conclusions</b>: Oncogenic mutations in <i>BRAF</i>, <i>KRAS</i> and <i>NRAS</i> genes can be detected in the bone marrow and plasma cfDNA with ddPCR in patients with MM patients and high VAF is associated with short survival."	"Hyperactivation of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway is prevalent in melanoma, principally due to mutations in the B-Raf and NRas genes. MAPK inhibitors are effective only short-term, and recurrence occurs due to functional redundancies or intertwined pathways. The remodeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also common in melanoma cells, partly through the increased expression of T-type channels (TTCCs). Here we summarize current knowledge about the prognostic value and molecular targeting of TTCCs. Furthermore, we discuss recent evidence pointing to TTCCs as molecular switches for melanoma chemoresistance, which set the grounds for novel combined therapies against the advanced disease."	"Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. UMs are usually initiated by a mutation in GNAQ or GNA11, unlike cutaneous melanomas, which usually harbour a BRAF or NRAS mutation. The annual incidence in Europe and the USA is ~6 per million population per year. Risk factors include fair skin, light-coloured eyes, congenital ocular melanocytosis, ocular melanocytoma and the BAP1-tumour predisposition syndrome. Ocular treatment aims at preserving the eye and useful vision and, if possible, preventing metastases. Enucleation has largely been superseded by various forms of radiotherapy, phototherapy and local tumour resection, often administered in combination. Ocular outcomes are best with small tumours not extending close to the optic disc and/or fovea. Almost 50% of patients develop metastatic disease, which usually involves the liver, and is usually fatal within 1 year. Although UM metastases are less responsive than cutaneous melanoma to chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors, encouraging results have been reported with partial hepatectomy for solitary metastases, with percutaneous hepatic perfusion with melphalan or with tebentafusp. Better insight into tumour immunology and metabolism may lead to new treatments."	"We aimed to study the prognostic value of <i>KRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i> mutations and microsatellite stable (MSS)/instable (MSI) in the field of colorectal cancer invading the <i>submucosa</i> (ie, pT1 colorectal cancer (CRC)).We led a case-control study in tumour samples from 60 patients with pT1 CRC with (20 cases) and without (40 cases) metastatic evolution (5 years of follow-up) which were analysed for <i>KRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i> mutations (Idylla testing and next generation sequencing, NGS) and MSS/MSI status (Idylla testing and expression of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins using immunohistochemistry).<i>KRAS</i> mutations were encountered in 11/20 (55%) cases and 21/40 (52.5%) controls (OR=1.11 (0.38 to 3.25), p=0.8548), <i>NRAS</i> mutations in 1/20 (5%) cases and 3/40 (7.5%) controls (OR=3.08 (0.62 to 15.39), p=0.1698) and <i>BRAF</i> mutations in 3/20 (15%) cases and 6/40 (15%) controls (OR=1.00 (0.22 to 4.5), p=1.00). A MSI status was diagnosed in 3/20 (15%) cases and 5/40 (12.5%) controls (OR=1.2353 (0.26 to 5.79), p=0.7885). Beyond the absence of significant association between the metastatic evolution and any of the studied molecular parameters, we observed a very good agreement between methods analysing <i>KRAS, NRAS</i> and <i>BRAF</i> mutations (Kappa value of 0.849 (0.748 to 0.95) between Idylla and NGS) and MSS/MSI (Idylla)-proficient MMR/deficient MMR (immunohistochemistry) status (Kappa value of 1.00).Although being feasible using the fully automated Idylla method as well as NGS, the molecular testing of <i>KRAS, NRAS, BRAF</i> and MSS/MSI status does not seem useful for prognostic purpose in the field of pT1 CRC."	"Giant congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN) arise primarily due to postzygotic mutations in NRAS, and are of clinical importance due to their increased risk of malignant transformation.<sup>1</sup> A subtype of large CMN, termed naevus spilus (NS)-type CMN, is identified by the presence of a patch which may have café-au-lait pigmentation and superimposed macular or papular lesions, which are demonstrably melanocytic naevi on histology."	"There are conflicting data regarding the role of KRAS mutation on the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Moreover, the role of other biomarkers such as NRAS or BRAF has not been studied.To analyze the incidence of VTE in a cohort of patients with CRC based on KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF status.We performed a retrospective review of patients with unresectable locally advanced and metastatic CRC (mCRC) and known KRAS/NRAS/BRAF status, attended in the Medical Oncology Department of the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (Madrid, Spain). The primary outcome was VTE defined as any venous thromboembolic event that occurred either 6 months before or at any time after the diagnosis of CRC. The biomarker status (KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) and other predictors of thrombosis were collected.One hundred and ninety-four patients were identified and included in the analysis. Forty-one patients (21.1%) experienced VTE. The incidence was 19.1% in RAS-mutated patients, 28.6% in BRAF-mutated patients and 21% in triple wild-type patients (p = NS). In multivariate analysis, ECOG ≥ 2 was the only independent predictor of VTE (OR 8.73; CI 95% 1.32-57.82; p = 0.025).In our study, biomarkers have not been associated with an increased risk of VTE in CRC patients. A high incidence of VTE in BRAF-mutated patients has been observed and should be explored in further studies."	"Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers are heterogenous and morphological classification is a complex and highly specialized task. Hence, identification of somatic alterations could provide insights to tumor biology and serve as an add-on diagnostic tool. Furthermore, results from these add-on tools could point in the direction of a more personalized treatment strategy. In the present study we set out to identify and validate the somatic mutation profile in a sample-set of follicular cell-derived thyroid neoplasia. One-hundred-and-one archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from patients diagnosed with follicular cell-derived thyroid neoplasia were included, and upon DNA-extraction and qualitative measurements 99 samples were eligible for amplicon-based next-generation-sequencing. Libraries were generated using the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel, followed by sequencing using a MiSeq. Upon data processing and variant filtering all variants were manually assessed to exclude false positive mutations in the final curated list. Moreover, hot-spot mutations were validated using an independent platform from Agilent. Each diagnostic group were correlated to mutation burden and individual mutations were classified according to recent guidelines for somatic mutation classification. Close to 100% of the archived FFPE samples were eligible for DNA-library preparation and amplicon sequencing based on DNA quality criterion. The distribution of mutations in the specific diagnostic groups resulted in a higher mutation frequency among the most dedifferentiated than in the groups with a more differentiated cell profile. Based on the distribution mutations across the samples and using hierarchical clustering, we generated four tentative mutational signatures; highly mutated tumors; tumors with mainly <i>NRAS</i> and <i>TP53</i> mutations; <i>BRAF</i> mutated tumors and tumors with none or single sporadic mutations. Future studies including more samples and follow-up data may amend these signatures, however our results imply that morphological classification of follicular cell derived thyroid neoplasia could be supplemented with a somatic mutational signature. Taken together, broad screening of the somatic alterations in FFPE tissue of thyroid neoplasia is comprehensible and essential for future identification of possible treatment targets and personalized medicine."	"Mevalonate kinase (MVK) mutations were previously identified in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. However, the role of MVK in differentiation, apoptosis and prenylation of keratinocytes requires further investigation. Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) of the mevalonate pathway attach to small G proteins, and serve as molecular switches in biochemical pathways. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of MVK in the expression of keratin 1 and involucrin, apoptosis, protein prenylation and the processing of small G proteins. HaCat human keratinocytes were transfected with viruses carrying MVK interference and overexpression vectors, respectively. The mRNA expression of MVK, keratin 1 and involucrin was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Protein expression of MVK, keratin 1, involucrin, lamin A, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, Rho E, Rho B, Rho A, RAC1 and cdc42 in HaCat cells was detected by western blotting. The apoptotic rates of HaCat cells and protein prenylation levels were examined by flow cytometry. The expression of MVK in HaCat cells was significantly decreased in the interference groups, and markedly increased in the overexpression group compared with the negative control groups. The mRNA and protein expression levels of keratin 1 and involucrin were significantly decreased following interference of MVK expression, and the decrease was markedly attenuated by FPP. Furthermore, the apoptotic rate was markedly increased following MVK interference, and the increase was significantly attenuated by GGPP. The overexpression of MVK significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of HaCat cells. The prenylation levels after MVK interference was notably decreased, which was markedly attenuated by GGPP. The overexpression of MVK significantly increased the prenylation levels of HaCat cells. FPP or GGPP reversed MVK interference-induced decrease in geranylgeranylation levels of lamin A, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, Rho E, Rho B, Rho A, RAC1 and cdc42. In conclusion, MVK interference decreases the expression of differentiation markers, increases apoptosis, and decreases protein prenylation and geranylgeranylation levels in keratinocytes. These changes are attenuated by FPP or GGPP."	"The clinicopathological and survival profiles across primary sites in acral melanoma (AM) are still controversial and unclear.This is a multi-center retrospective study. Clinicopathological data of AM patients diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017 from 6 large tertiary hospitals in China were extracted. Chi square tests were used to compare basic characteristics between primary sites of sole, palm and nail bed. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS) differences based on primary sites were compared by log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regressions were used to identify prognostic factors for MSS.In total, 1157 AM patients were included. The sole group had a more advanced initial stage, deeper Breslow thickness, higher recurrence rate and distant metastases risk (all P &lt; 0.05). The proportion of age &lt; 65 years and ulceration were statistically lower in nail bed and palm groups, respectively. A total of 294 patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and rates of positive SLN status had no statistical difference across primary sites. Among 701 patients with genetic profiles, the mutational frequency of BRAF, C-KIT, and PDGFRA were similar except for NRAS (higher in sole group, P = 0.0102). The median MSS of sole, nail bed and palm patients were 65.0 months, 112.0 months, and not reached, respectively (log-rank P = 0.0053). In multivariate analyses, primary site, initial stage, ulceration and recurrence were the prognostic factors for MSS in overall population, but the statistical significance varied over primary sites.Substantial clinicopathological and survival heterogeneities exist across different primary sites in the AM population. Sole melanoma has worse prognosis compared with palm and nail bed subtypes."	"The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is critical to the development of colorectal cancers, and KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations foster resistance to radiation. We performed a phase I trial to determine the safety of trametinib, a potent MEK1/2 inhibitor, with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) chemoradiation (CRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).Stage II/III rectal cancer patients were enrolled on a phase I study with 3+3 study design, with an expansion cohort of 9 patients at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Following a 5-day trametinib lead-in, with pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies, patients received trametinib and CRT, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Trametinib was given orally daily at 3 dose levels: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg. CRT consisted of infusional 5FU 225 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day and 28 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (total 50.4Gy). The primary endpoint was to identify the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for phosphorylated -ERK (pERK) and genomic profiling was performed on the tumor samples.Patients were enrolled to all dose levels, and 18 patients were evaluable for toxicities and responses. Treatment was well-tolerated, and there was one dose-limiting toxicity of diarrhea, which was attributed to CRT rather than trametinib. At the 2 mg dose level, 25% had pathological complete response. IHC staining confirmed dose-dependent decrease in pERK with increasing trametinib doses.The combination of trametinib with 5FU-CRT is safe and well-tolerated, and may warrant additional study in a phase II trial, perhaps in a RAS/RAF-mutant selected population."	"<b>Introduction</b>: Binimetinib is an uncompetitive, small-molecule inhibitor of selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (<i>MEK</i>1/2) and was recently approved in 2018 in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of metastatic melanomas. Preclinical and clinical trial data on the drug demonstrate its potent efficacy in cancers, especially melanomas with <i>BRAF</i> and <i>NRAS</i> mutations.<b>Areas covered</b>: The authors review the preclinical as well as clinical Phase 1, 2 and 3 trial data leading to its FDA approval in 2018 for metastatic melanoma. Phase 3 data in combination with encorafenib demonstrated double the PFS (14.9 months) compared to vemurafenib alone (7.3 months) in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma.<b>Expert opinion</b>: No longer-term data is available yet to demonstrate any durable complete responses to therapy with binimetinib or improvements in overall survival compared to other FDA-approved therapies including immunotherapy or vemurafenib. Treatment approaches to patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma should be individualized and binimetinib in combination with encorafenib is a reasonable oral strategy with a reasonably tolerated toxicity profile. The cost of treatment and durability of response should be incorporated into the discussion as part of the overall medical decision-making."	"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genodermatosis caused by heterozygous germ line variations in the NF1 gene. A second-hit NF1 aberration results in the formation of café-au-lait macules, cutaneous neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma (PNF). Mosaic NF1 (mNF1), caused by a postzygotic NF1 mutation, is characterized by localized or generalized NF1-related manifestations. Although NF1 and mNF1 are associated with pigmentary skin lesions, clinically recognizable melanocytic nevi that developed over PNF have not been reported. Here, we report the first case of multiple melanocytic nevi that developed on a giant café-au-lait macule and PNF. The PNF had biallelic NF1 deletions, a whole deletion of NF1 and a novel intragenic deletion involving exons 25-30. The deletions were not detected in the blood, which resulted in the diagnosis of mNF1. Furthermore, the nevus cells had not only biallelic NF1 deletions but also NRAS Q61R, a common mutation found in congenital melanocytic nevi. These analyses revealed the coexistence of the two different mosaic diseases, mNF1 and congenital melanocytic nevi. For a diagnosis of cases with atypical NF1-like symptoms, genetic analyses using blood and lesional tissues are useful and aid in genetic counseling."
"PTPN11"	"Noonan syndrome"	"Overlapping syndromes such as Noonan, Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous, Noonan syndrome (NS) with multiple lentigines and Costello syndromes are genetically heterogeneous conditions sharing a dysregulation of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and are known collectively as the RASopathies. PTPN11 was the first disease-causing gene identified in NS and remains the more prevalent. We report seven patients from three families presenting heterozygous missense variants in PTPN11 probably responsible for a disease phenotype distinct from the classical Noonan syndrome. The clinical presentation and common features of these seven cases overlap with the SHORT syndrome. The latter is the consequence of PI3K/AKT signaling deregulation with the predominant disease-causing gene being PIK3R1. Our data suggest that the phenotypic spectrum associated with pathogenic variants of PTPN11 could be wider than previously described, and this could be due to the dual activity of SHP2 (ie, PTPN11 gene product) on the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling."	"In humans, histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an aggressive cancer involving histiocytes. Its rarity and heterogeneity explain that treatment remains a challenge. Sharing high clinical and histopathological similarities with human HS, the canine HS is conversely frequent in specific breeds and thus constitutes a unique spontaneous model for human HS to decipher the genetic bases and to explore therapeutic options. We identified sequence alterations in the MAPK pathway in at least 63.9% (71/111) of HS cases with mutually exclusive BRAF (0.9%; 1/111), KRAS (7.2%; 8/111) and PTPN11 (56.75%; 63/111) mutations concentrated at hotspots common to human cancers. Recurrent PTPN11 mutations are associated to visceral disseminated HS subtype in dogs, the most aggressive clinical presentation. We then identified PTPN11 mutations in 3/19 (15.7%) human HS patients. Thus, we propose PTPN11 mutations as key events for a specific subset of human and canine HS: the visceral disseminated form. Finally, by testing drugs targeting the MAPK pathway in eight canine HS cell lines, we identified a better anti-proliferation activity of MEK inhibitors than PTPN11 inhibitors in canine HS neoplastic cells. In combination, these results illustrate the relevance of naturally affected dogs in deciphering genetic mechanisms and selecting efficient targeted therapies for such rare and aggressive cancers in humans."	"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare clonal myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm of early childhood. Historically, it was difficult to diagnose clinically, as patients present with manifestations shared with other hematologic malignancies or viral infections. It is now clear that JMML is a disease of hyperactive RAS signaling.We examined the bone marrow of 41 Egyptian children with JMML by direct sequencing for mutations in the RAS pathway genes.Mutations were detected in 33 (80%) of 41 patients. We identified 12 (29%) of 41 patients with PTPN11 mutation; 18 (44%) of 41 with RAS mutation; 9 (22%) of 41 with NRAS mutation; 9 (22%) of 41 with KRAS mutation; and 3 (7%) of 41 with CBL mutation. Eleven (92%) of the PTPN11 mutations were detected in exon 3 and 1 (8%) in exon 13. Seven of the NRAS mutations were in exon 2, and 2 were in exon 3. All KRAS mutations were in exon 2. The 3 cases with CBL mutation were homozygous mutations in exon 8. All the mutations detected in PTPN11, NRAS/KRAS, and the CBL genes were previously reported missense mutations in JMML.Our results demonstrate that Egyptian children diagnosed with JMML have high frequency of NRAS/KRAS mutations and lower frequency of PTPN11 mutations as compared with previous studies. The concept of mutually exclusive RAS pathway mutations was clearly observed in our patients. All cancer centers in our region should start implementing molecular diagnostic methods before confirming the diagnosis of JMML and before offering hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."	"<i>Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11)</i> encodes the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 that is overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, the association of <i>PTPN11</i> methylation levels with the incidence of GC and its correlation with SHP-2 overexpression were investigated. The methylation levels of <i>PTPN11</i> in tumor and adjacent normal tissues of 112 GC patients were assessed by quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database was used to analyze the association between <i>PTPN11</i> methylation and <i>PTPN11</i> expression. Survival analyses were conducted in order to evaluate the prognostic value of <i>PTPN11</i> methylation for GC. The results of the qMSP analysis indicated that the methylation levels of <i>PTPN11</i> in GC tumor tissues were significantly decreased compared with those noted in the normal adjacent tissues (mean with standard deviation: 40.91±26.33 vs. 51.99±37.37, P=0.007). An inverse correlation between <i>PTPN11</i> methylation levels and <i>PTPN11</i> mRNA expression levels (P=4×10<sup>-6</sup>, <i>r</i>=-0.237) was noted. Subgroup analyses indicated that the association of <i>PTPN11</i> hypomethylation with the incidence of GC was specific to male subjects (P=0.015), heavy drinking patients (P=0.019), patients with poor tumor differentiation (P=0.010) and patients with tumor node and metastasis (TNM) stage III+IV (P=0.008). Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank test suggested that <i>PTPN11</i> hypomethylation was not associated with GC patient overall survival (P=0.605) and recurrence (P=0.485), although it could predict the recurrence of GC patients up to and including 60 years (≤60, P=0.049). The results indicated that <i>PTPN11</i> levels were hypomethylated in GC patients. TCGA data analysis suggested that <i>PTPN11</i> hypomethylation could cause an upregulation in the transcription levels of <i>PTPN11</i>. Although, this may explain the pattern of SHP-2 overexpression in GC, additional studies are required to verify this hypothesis. The association of <i>PTPN11</i> hypomethylation with GC incidence may be specific to male patients, heavy drinking patients, patients with poor tumor differentiation and patients with TNM stage of III+IV. <i>PTPN11</i> hypomethylation can be considered a biomarker for the recurrence of GC patients with an age of 60 years or lower."	"Noonan syndrome (NS), an autosomal dominant developmental genetic disorder, is caused by germline mutations in genes associated with the RAS / mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In several studies PTPN11 is one of the genes with a significant number of pathogenic variants in NS-affected patients. Therefore, clinically diagnosed NS individuals are initially tested for pathogenic variants in PTPN11 gene to confirm the relationship before studying genotype-phenotype correlation.Individuals (363) with clinically diagnosed NS from four hospitals in South India were recruited and the exons of PTPN11 gene were sequenced.Thirty-two previously described pathogenic variants in eight different exons in PTPN11 gene were detected in 107 patients, of whom 10 were familial cases. Exons 3, 8 and 13 had the highest number of pathogenic variants. The most commonly identified pathogenic variants in this series were in exon 8 (c.922A &gt; G, c.923A &gt; G), observed in 22 of the affected. Congenital cardiac anomalies were present in 84% of the mutation-positive cohort, the majority being defects in the right side of the heart. The most common facial features were downward-slanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism and low-set posteriorly rotated ears. Other clinical features included short stature (40%), pectus excavatum (54%) and, in males, unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism (44%).The clinical features and mutational spectrum observed in our cohort are similar to those reported in other large studies done worldwide. This is the largest case series of NS-affected individuals with PTPN11 mutations described till date from India."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder with characteristic features and molecular alterations. The most common recurrent alteration is in the PTPN11 gene, a proto-oncogene that encodes a cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine phosphatase and helps regulate kinase activity and control cell survival and replication. Mutations in this gene can increase the risk for the development of multiple different malignancies, particularly hematopoietic. Here we present a case of NS with a PTPN11 mutation demonstrating the classic presentation of Noonan syndrome as well as the expected clinical follow-up."	"Cancer remains the number one cause of disease-related mortality in children, and despite advances in the molecular understanding of leukemia and targeted therapies, refractory leukemia remains a leading cause of death. It therefore is essential to further define features, e.g., <i>FLT3</i> alterations and <i>KMT2A</i> rearrangements, associated with inferior survival early to augment or alter therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes.To gain insights into the genetic drivers predictive of aggressive clinical behavior among pediatric leukemia patients, we performed comprehensive integrative clinical sequencing (ICS), including paired tumor/normal DNA sequencing and RNA-seq, for pediatric patients who presented at our institution over a period of five years with acute lymphoblastic or myelogenous leukemia (ALL and AML; n=43) and high-risk clinical features (high white blood cell count, extramedullary disease, or refractory and/or relapsed disease).We found that <i>RAS</i>- and Ras-pathway aberrations, including <i>N-RAS</i>, <i>NF1</i> and <i>PTPN11</i>, are frequent somatic mutations and, importantly, associated with decreased event free and overall survival (OS) (P=0.04, median event free survival 22.8 <i>vs.</i> 5.6 months; P=0.04, median OS 124 <i>vs.</i> 22.5 months).We thus propose that hyperactive Ras signaling confers inferior survival in high-risk pediatric acute leukemia and that Ras pathways should be molecularly characterized to inform clinical decision making and to identify patients for experimental clinical trials and RAS-targeted therapy."	"Background Genetic testing is helpful for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mimics. Little data are available regarding the yield of such testing and its clinical impact. Methods The HCM genetic database at our center was used for identification of patients who underwent HCM-directed genetic testing including at least 1 gene associated with an HCM mimic (<i>GLA</i>, <i>TTR</i>, <i>PRKAG2</i>, <i>LAMP2</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, and <i>DES</i>). Charts were retrospectively reviewed and genetic and clinical data extracted. Results There were 1731 unrelated HCM patients who underwent genetic testing for at least 1 gene related to an HCM mimic. In 1.45% of cases, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in one of these genes was identified. This included a yield of 1% for Fabry disease, 0.3% for familial amyloidosis, 0.15% for <i>PRKAG2</i>-related cardiomyopathy, and 1 patient with Noonan syndrome. In the majority of patients, diagnosis of the HCM mimic based on clinical findings alone would have been challenging. Accurate diagnosis of an HCM mimic led to change in management (eg, enzyme replacement therapy) or family screening in all cases. Conclusions Genetic testing is helpful in the diagnosis of HCM mimics in patients with no or few extracardiac manifestations. Adding these genes to all HCM genetic panels should be considered."	"Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is still a challenging diagnosis. The differential diagnosis is extensive and the success of identifying a cause depends on the thoroughness of efforts to establish a diagnosis. For the early diagnosis of NIHF, a virtual gene panel diagnostic tool was developed. The female premature baby in question was delivered via emergency cesarean at 30 + 1 weeks of gestational age (GA) due to rapidly developing NIHF to a healthy mother. The family history was noncontributory.DNA of the family was extracted and sequenced by the virtual hydrops panel with whole-exome sequencing.The hydrops panel revealed Noonan syndrome (NS) with a germline mutation in PTPN11 c.218C&gt;T (p.Thr73Ile).The diagnosis of our patient was rapidly confirmed by the hydrops panel. The variant of c.218C&gt;T (p.Thr73Ile) has not yet been described in literature relating to NIHF. Only a few case reports of this variant are known. This particular mutation is associated with Noonan syndrome, congenital heart defect and persistent thrombocytopenia. Few reveal juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia."	"SHP2 is an unusual protein phosphatase that functions as an activator for several signaling pathways, including the RAS pathway, while most other phosphatases suppress their downstream signaling cascades. The physiological and pathophysiological roles of SHP2 have been extensively studied in the field of cancer research. Mutations in the <i>PTPN11</i> gene which encodes SHP2 are also highly associated with developmental disorders, such as Noonan syndrome (NS), and cognitive deficits including learning disabilities are common among NS patients. However, the molecular and cellular mechanism by which SHP2 is involved in cognitive functions is not well understood. Recent studies using SHP2 mutant mice or pharmacological inhibitors have shown that SHP2 plays critical role in learning and memory and synaptic plasticity. Here, we review the recent studies demonstrating that SHP2 is involved in synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory, by the regulation of the expression and/or function of glutamate receptors. We suggest that each cell type may have distinct paths connecting the dots between SHP2 and glutamate receptors, and these paths may also change with aging."	"Noonan syndrome is a common genetic disease characterized by peculiar face, short stature, congenital heart disease and thoracic deformity. The pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome is mainly related to abnormal Ras-MAPK signal pathway which involves more than 16 genes including (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1)] and KRAS. At present, there is a lack of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of Noonan syndrome in China. This guideline has summarized the clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment for Noonan syndrome, with an aim to improve the diagnostic level and clinical management of patients with this syndrome."	"A concomitant change of nucleus shape and chromosome conformation often happens in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. However, the relation between the 3D chromosome architecture and the genome-wide epigenetic pattern for transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. In this study, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) were employed to investigate the landscape of chromosome distal interaction and H3K4/27me3 in HL-60 cells treated with ATRA. We observed a general loss of topological associated domains (TADs) at PTPN11 during the differentiation of HL-60 cells. Furthermore, the significantly reduced enrichment of CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) near the boundary where PTPN11 located, as well as the decreased H3K4me3 and increased H3K27me3 enrichment at PTPN11 upon ATRA treatment was observed. Taken together, our study indicated a regulatory mechanism behind the silenced PTPN11 in HL-60 cells differentiation."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common congenital multiple-anomaly syndrome, resembling Turner syndrome, but without chromosomal anomaly. Besides the unusual facies, the maxillofacial and dental features of patients with NS are not well-summarized in the literature. The aim of this study was to describe these features and propose specific treatment guidelines for practitioners involved in oral and maxillofacial care. A retrospective multicentric study was conducted of 14 patients who were referred for NS screening. In total, 10 patients were found to carry a mutation involved in NS or NS-related disorders. Fifty percent of the mutations affected PTPN11. All patients presented with the typical extraoral features, such as macrocephaly, hypertelorism, ptosis, triangular face shape and ear dystrophy. Intraoral manifestations, including malocclusion (maxillary transversal deficiency, crossbite, anterior open-bite and class II malocclusion), dental anomalies (delayed eruption, agenesis and dystrophy, odontoma) and radiologic jaw lesions were identified in five out of 10 patients. These findings were searched in a review of the literature to obtain a comprehensive description of oral and maxillofacial features in patients with NS. The proposed treatment guidelines emphasize frequent coagulation anomalies that need to be considered prior to surgery. Early dental assessment and yearly follow-up with oral prophylaxis are recommended. Orthodontics and orthognathic surgery are also of primary importance in the management of NS patients."	"Germline PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan syndrome (NS), the most common disorder among RASopathies. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, a protein tyrosine-phosphatase controlling signaling through the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. Generally, NS-causing PTPN11 mutations are missense changes destabilizing the inactive conformation of the protein or enhancing its binding to signaling partners. Here, we report on two PTPN11 variants resulting in the deletion or duplication of one of three adjacent glutamine residues (Gln<sup>255</sup> -to-Gln<sup>257</sup> ). While p.(Gln257dup) caused a typical NS phenotype in carriers of a first family, p.(Gln257del) had incomplete penetrance in a second family. Missense mutations involving Gln<sup>256</sup> had previously been reported in NS. This poly-glutamine stretch is located on helix B of the PTP domain, a region involved in stabilizing SHP2 in its autoinhibited state. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that changes affecting this motif perturb the SHP2's catalytically inactive conformation and/or substrate recognition. Biochemical data showed that duplication and deletion of Gln<sup>257</sup> variably enhance SHP2's catalytic activity, while missense changes involving Gln<sup>256</sup> affect substrate specificity. Expression of mutants in HEK293T cells documented their activating role on MAPK signaling, uncoupling catalytic activity and modulation of intracellular signaling. These findings further document the relevance of helix B in the regulation of SHP2's function."	"The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 of higher vertebrates, encoded by ptpn11 gene, catalyzes the dephosphorylation of tyrosine phosphorylation site, and plays regulatory roles in various signaling pathways by cooperating with other protein tyrosine kinase. Previous studies have shown that SHP2 plays an important role in the activation and signal transduction of T and B cells in higher vertebrates. To study the role of a SHP2 homologous molecule of lampreys (Lja-SHP2) in immune response, we cloned and expressed the open reading frame sequence of Lja-SHP2 gene in prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a. The recombinant protein was successfully expressed in E. coli and the rabbit-derived polyclonal antibody was prepared. Lampetra japonica were immunized with mixed bacteria, and the mRNA and protein of Lja-SHP2 in immune-related cells and tissues were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting after immunization. The Lja-SHP2 mRNA and protein were not significantly affected in leukocytes and supraneural myeloid bodies, but up-regulated significantly in gill tissues (P&lt;0.05) after challenged by mixed bacteria, which indicated that Lja-SHP2 mainly participates in the immune response of gill tissues after mixed bacteria stimulation. To further investigate whether Lja-SHP2 level was affected in three lymphocyte subsets, the B-cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and T-cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were employed to boost the immune response in L. japonica. LPS immune stimulation increased Lja-SHP2 in leucocytes significantly compared with the control group, and but had a marginal effect on Lja-SHP2 expression in gills and supraneural myeloid bodies. PHA immune stimulation could up-regulate Lja-SHP2 level in leukocytes, gill tissues and supraneural myeloid bodies. The change of Lja-SHP2 was especially dramatical in leukocytes, which was about 2.5 times higher than that in the control group, suggesting that Lja-SHP2 is involved in the lamprey immune response mediated by PHA. Consistent with the previous finding that PHA could induce the activation of VLRA<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, our results showed that Lja-SHP2 might be included in the immune response of VLRA<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes mediated by PHA in gills. This research will benefit exploring the functions of Lja-SHP2 in the immune response of lamprey and will provide clues for understanding the phylogenesis of SHP2 molecular family, and its roles in the early occurrence and evolution of adaptive immune system in higher vertebrates."	"An increasing number of anti-cancer therapeutic agents target specific mutant proteins that are expressed by many different tumor types. Successful use of these therapies is dependent on the presence or absence of somatic mutations within the patient's tumor that can confer clinical efficacy or drug resistance.The aim of our study was to determine the type, frequency, overlap and functional proteomic effects of potentially targetable recurrent somatic hotspot mutations in 47 cancer-related genes in multiple disease sites that could be potential therapeutic targets using currently available agents or agents in clinical development.Using MassArray technology, of the 1300 patient tumors analysed 571 (43.9%) had at least one somatic mutation. Mutations were identified in 30 different genes. KRAS (16.5%), PIK3CA (13.6%) and BRAF (3.8%) were the most frequently mutated genes. Prostate (10.8%) had the lowest number of somatic mutations identified, while no mutations were identified in sarcoma. Ocular melanoma (90.6%), endometrial (72.4%) and colorectal (66.4%) tumors had the highest number of mutations. We noted high concordance between mutations in different parts of the tumor (94%) and matched primary and metastatic samples (90%). KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. Mutation co-occurrence involved mainly PIK3CA and PTPN11, and PTPN11 and APC. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analysis demonstrated that PI3K and MAPK signalling pathways were more altered in tumors with mutations compared to wild type tumors.Hotspot mutational profiling is a sensitive, high-throughput approach for identifying mutations of clinical relevance to molecular based therapeutics for treatment of cancer, and could potentially be of use in identifying novel opportunities for genotype-driven clinical trials."	"The MAPK (RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK) signaling pathway is a kinase cascade involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in response to external stimuli. The V600E mutation in the BRAF gene has been detected in various tumors, resulting in a 500-fold increase in BRAF kinase activity. However, monotherapy with selective BRAF V600E inhibitors often leads to reactivation of MAPK signaling cascade and emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, new targets are being developed for the inhibition of components of the aberrantly activated cascade. It was recently discovered that resistance to BRAF V600E inhibitors may be associated with the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 encoded by the PTPN11 gene. In this paper, we analyzed transcriptional effects of PTPN11 gene knockdown and selective suppression of BRAF V600E in a model of thyroid follicular epithelium. We found that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTPN11 after vemurafenib treatment prevented an increase in the expression CCNA1 and NOTCH4 genes involved in the formation of drug resistance of tumors. On the other hand, downregulation of PTPN11 expression blocked the transcriptional activation of genes (p21, p15, p16, RB1, and IGFBP7) involved in cell cycle regulation and oncogene-induced senescence in response to BRAF V600E expression. Therefore, it can be assumed that SHP-2 participates not only in emergence of drug resistance in cancer cells, but also in oncogene-induced cell senescence."	"Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been investigated for wide variety of applications. Their unique properties render them highly applicable as MRI contrast agents, in magnetic hyperthermia or targeted drug delivery. SPIONs surface properties affect a whole array of parameters such as: solubility, toxicity, stability, biodistribution etc. Therefore, progress in the field of SPIONs surface functionalization is crucial for further development of therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In this study, SPIONs were synthesized by thermal decomposition of iron (III) acetylacetonate Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> and functionalized with dihexadecyl phosphate (DHP) via phase transfer. Bioactivity of the SPION-DHP was assessed on SW1353 and TCam-2 cancer derived cell lines. The following test were conducted: cytotoxicity and proliferation assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, SPIONs uptake (via Iron Staining and ICP-MS), expression analysis of the following genes: alkaline phosphatase (ALPL); ferritin light chain (FTL); serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11); transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) via RT-qPCR. SPION-DHP nanoparticles were successfully obtained and did not reveal significant cytotoxicity in the range of tested concentrations. ROS generation was elevated, however not correlated with the concentrations. Gene expression profile was slightly altered only in SW1353 cells."	"Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by PTPN11, regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and survival via releasing intramolecular autoinhibition and modulating various signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Mutations and aberrant expression of SHP2 are implicated in human developmental disorders, leukemias and several solid tumors. As an oncoprotein in some cancers, SHP2 represents a rational target for inhibitors to interfere. Nevertheless, its tumor suppressive effect has also been uncovered, indicating the context-specificity. Even so, two types of SHP2 inhibitors including targeting catalytic pocket and allosteric sites have been developed associated with resolved cocrystal complexes. Herein, we describe its structure, biological function, deregulation in human diseases and summarize recent advance in development of SHP2 inhibitors, trying to give an insight into the therapeutic potential in future."

"RAF1"	"Noonan syndrome"	"Environmental mold (fungus) exposure poses a significant threat to public health by causing illnesses ranging from invasive fungal diseases in immune compromised individuals to allergic hypertensive diseases such as asthma and asthma exacerbation in otherwise healthy people. However, the molecular pathogenesis has not been completely understood, and treatment options are limited. Due to its thermo-tolerance to the normal human body temperature, Aspergillus. fumigatus (A.fumigatus) is one of the most important human pathogens to cause different lung fungal diseases including fungal asthma. Airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness caused by mucus overproduction are the hallmarks of many A.fumigatus induced lung diseases. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we have utilized a well-established A.fumigatus extracts (AFE) model to elucidate downstream signal pathways that mediate A.fumigatus induced mucin production in airway epithelial cells. AFE was found to stimulate time- and dose-dependent increase of major airway mucin gene expression (MUC5AC and MUC5B) partly via the elevation of their promoter activities. We also demonstrated that EGFR was required but not sufficient for AFE-induced mucin expression, filling the paradoxical gap from a previous study using the same model. Furthermore, we showed that fungal proteases in AFE were responsible for mucin induction by activating a Ras/Raf1/ERK signaling pathway. Ca2+ signaling, but ROS, both of which were stimulated by fungal proteases, was an indispensable determinant for ERK activation and mucin induction. The discovery of this novel pathway likely contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of fungal sensitization in allergic diseases such as fungal asthma."	"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly lethal disease worldwide. The majority of patients receiving targeted therapy or chemotherapy develop drug resistance, while its molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. The plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) exhibited the potential in identifying gene variations and monitoring drug resistance in CRC treatment. In this study, we monitored the ctDNA mutational changes in advanced CRC patients underwent first-line therapy with bevacizumab and cetuximab combined with chemotherapy. The mutation spectrum of 43 patients was established by a 605-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. The baseline measurement shows that genes with the highest mutation frequency were TP53 (74%), APC (58%), KRAS (40%), SYNE1 (33%), LRP1B (23%), TOP1 (23%), and PIK3CA (21%). Mutations in TP53, APC, and KRAS were detected in 29 paired plasma and tissue samples with the consistency of 81, 67, and 42%, respectively. Clinically targetable gene mutations, such as APC, RNF43, SMAD4, BRAD1, KRAS, RAF1, and TP53, were also identified in ctDNA. The overall consistency between ctDNA and tissue samples was 54.6%. Alleviation of mutational burden in BRAF, KRAS, AMER1, and other major driving genes was observed following the first-line therapy. Patients with KRAS and TP53 mutations in tissues appeared to benefit more than the wild-type counterpart. The dynamic change of plasma mutation status was consistent with the tissue tumor burden and was closely correlated with disease progression. In conclusion, ctDNA monitoring is a useful method for molecular genotyping of colorectal cancer patients. Dynamic changes in resistance can be sensitively monitored by gene variation status, which potentially helps to develop treatment strategy."	"BACKGROUND As a common metabolic disorder, osteoporosis is characterized by decreasing bone mass density and increased possibility of fragility fracture. The incidence of senile osteoporosis increases year by year. There is no gold standard of treatment for osteoporosis. Tomatidine is the aglycone derivative of tomatine, having the ability to treat various diseases, including osteoporosis. However, the mechanism by which tomatidine improves osteoporosis has not been fully elucidated. Tomatidine is a potential and promising drug for osteoporosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, the KEGG pathways that tomatidine-targeted genes enriched in were obtained using bioinformatics methods. The KEGG pathways involved in osteoporosis that were also associated with tomatidine-targeted genes were selected. After analysis of these pathways, essential genes that may be involved in this biological process were identified and validated experimentally. RESULTS We found 110 osteoporosis related KEGG pathways and 76 tomatidine-targeted genes-related KEGG pathways were obtained. 39 shared KEGG pathways were identified. The top 5 pathways were: pathway of chronic myeloid leukemia, pathway of B cell receptor signaling, pathway in cancer, bladder cancer pathway, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway. MAPK1, MAP2K1, MAPK3, RAF1 were involved in all the 5 pathways. The p53 signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway were involved in the 5 KEGG pathways. In vitro experiments showed that downregulating p53 expression could be potentially protective for osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS Tomatidine can improve osteoporosis, and one of the mechanisms of its action is achieved by modulating p53. Tomatidine may be a promising drug for osteoporosis."	"KRAS mutations occur in a quarter of all of human cancers, yet no selective drug has been approved to treat these tumors. Despite the recent development of drugs that block KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, the majority of KRAS oncoproteins remain undruggable. Here, we review recent efforts to validate individual components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as targets to treat KRAS-mutant cancers by comparing genetic information derived from experimental mouse models of KRAS-driven lung and pancreatic tumors with the outcome of selective MAPK inhibitors in clinical trials. We also review the potential of RAF1 as a key target to block KRAS-mutant cancers."	"Reactive astrogliosis, a common phenomenon after central nervous system (CNS) injury, exerts negative effects on neuronal repair and recovery by forming a glial scar. Mitofusin2 (Mfn2), a hyperplasia suppression gene, is a potential target of therapeutics to better control astrogliosis. To simulate traumatic injury of the CNS in vivo, an in vitro scratch injury model was established to investigate the role of Mfn2 in the proliferation of astrocytes in this study. We demonstrated that scratch-injury stimulation upregulated the expression of the markers cyclin D1, PCNA and GFAP and turned quiescent astrocytes into mitotic cells, which may have been via activation of Ras-Raf1-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt signaling. Meanwhile, both the gene and protein of Mfn2 were markedly inhibited. Furthermore, overexpression of Mfn2 effectively attenuated astrocyte proliferation and halted the cell cycle, concomitant with marker downregulation and wound healing suppression. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of Mfn2 inhibits the reactive astrogliosis process by blocking the Raf1-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt signal pathways. Therapeutic approaches that target Mfn2 may have protective effects against reactive gliosis and glia formation."	"A recent breakthrough in the classification of soft tissue tumors (STT) has been a significant expansion in the number of neoplasms associated with NTRK and other kinase related fusions. This is important not only for diagnostic purposes, but also because it opens new avenues for targeted therapy. Indeed, recent clincal trials have shown significant benefit across multiple tumor-types, prompting approval of NTRK inhibitors for clinical use in the setting of advanced/metastatic NTRK-rearranged neoplasms. Despite these therapeutic oportunities, diagnostic challenges have transpired in recognizing these emerging new histologic subtypes of kinase fusions positive-STT prospectively. This, in part, is attributable to their wide morphologic spectrum, variable risk of malignancy, and non-specific immunoprofile. As such, recommendations for pathologic criteria and immunohistochemical testing are needed to improve classification and streamline the small subset of potential candidates for further molecular validation. This overview summarizes the key histologic features of various STT associated with NTRK and other kinase fusions, which appear to share a similar morphologic spectrum. Immunohistochemically, many of these tumors, regardless of the kinase fusion type, notably show co-expression of S100 and CD34; issues related to the utility of pan-NTRK and NTRK1 immunostaining are therefore summarized. Finally, I discuss the role of confirmatory molecular testing and how, in some instances, this may also be of prognostic value. This review is intended as a critical summary of the current literature to emphasize pathologic criteria for improving recognition of this emerging and complex group of kinase fusion associated STT."	"A novel group of S100- and CD34-positive spindle cell tumors with distinctive stromal and perivascular hyalinization harboring recurrent gene fusions involving kinases including RAF1, BRAF, NTRK1/2/3, and RET have been recently reported. To our knowledge, no such cases harboring ALK rearrangements have been identified. We report a previously healthy 41-year-old male with a 12-cm intramuscular shoulder mass. The tumor was composed of bland-appearing spindled to epithelioid cells, arranged in a patternless pattern in a background of loose myxoid stroma containing striking amianthoid-like stromal collagen and perivascular rings. In accordance with the previously reported tumors, the tumor cells showed diffuse immunopositivity with S100 and CD34, while lacking SOX10 expression. Targeted RNA-based next-generation sequencing identified a novel serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-beta-catalytic subunit (PPP1CB)-ALK fusion gene. Although ALK break-apart was not detected by FISH, likely due to a paracentric inversion of chromosome 2, the presence of the fusion was confirmed by Sanger sequencing showing a 10-bp linker between exon 6 of PPP1CB and intron 19 of ALK while maintaining reading frame. Subsequent ALK-1 immunostain exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining in the tumor cells. Our case expands the molecular genetic spectrum of the distinctive group of spindle cell tumors with CD34/S100+ immunophenotype, supporting the important role of various kinases as drivers of oncogenesis. Awareness of this entity including its unique morphologic and immunophenotypic features as well as its interchangeable kinase gene fusions is crucial for correct classification and potential targeted therapy, particularly in aggressive subsets."	"GILZ expression is induced by glucocorticoids (GCs) and is involved in the mechanism of airway epithelial cell repair in patients with asthma. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-222-3p/GILZ pathway in treatment of airway epithelial cell repair by GCs. 9HTE cells were treated by 10 µmol/L dexamethasone (Dex) for 6, 12, and 24 hours (h). MiR-222-3p mimic and GILZ were used for cell transfection. Cell vitality, migration, and invasion were detected by methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT), wound healing, and Transwell. The targeting relationship between miR-222-3p and GILZ was predicted by TargetScan and further confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expressions of relative mRNAs or proteins were detected by Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results showed that Dex treatment up-regulated the GILZ expression level but inhibited the levels of p-Raf1, p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and miR-222-3p of the cells, moreover, it also inhibited cell activity, migration, and invasion in a time-dependent manner. MiR-222-3p specifically targeted GILZ. MiR-222-3p mimic ameliorated the cell viability, migration, and invasion reduced by Dex treatment, increased the expression levels of p-Raf1 and p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and partially reversed the effects of GILZ overexpression on the above indexes. Moreover, GILZ showed the opposite effects to miR-222-3p. MiR-222-3p activated MAPK signaling pathway through inhibiting the GILZ expression, thus promoting the cell viability, migration, and invasion previously reduced by Dex."	"Monitoring the early treatment effect of sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is a diagnostic challenge. In a previous study, we reported the potential role of liver computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in the assessment of the response to sorafenib therapy in HCC. The present study aims to investigate whether sorafenib-targeted genes is correlated with CTP parameter, and investigate the potential of sorafenib-targeted genes in early prediction of therapeutic response to sorafenib in advanced HCC.A total of 21 HCC patients were enrolled. Sorafenib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice daily continuously. Treatment response was assessed using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) criteria. CTP scanning was performed before and after two weeks of sorafenib treatment using a 320-detector row CT scanner. The perfusion parameters of portal vein flow (PVF), hepatic artery flow (HAF), and perfusion index (PI) were acquired by CTP. The expression levels of several sorafenib-targeted genes were assayed using real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the relationship between HAF values and RAF1 expression levels.According to mRECIST, the disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) of treatment group was 70.5% after two months of treatment. Compared to background controls, tumor tissues exhibited higher HAF. A sorafenib-targeted gene, RAF1 expression, was increased in tumor tissues especially in the sorafenib-resistant group. The sorafenib-resistant group exhibited a significantly higher RAF1 expression and HAF than the sensitive group. Moreover, the RAF1 expression is positively correlated with the HAF value.RAF1 expression might predict therapeutic effects of sorafenib in advanced HCC, where RAF1 could potentially serve as a molecular marker for monitoring early therapeutic effects after sorafenib treatment."	"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a toxic air pollutant that causes immune damage. Recent studies have found that neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is one way in which neutrophils exert immune functions. In addition, the formation of NETs is also related to thrombosis and autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in the regulation of a variety of pathophysiological processes. Here, we investigated the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in regulating the formation of NETs by affecting miR-16-5p. Our study established an in vitro H<sub>2</sub>S exposure model for neutrophils using phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) to induce NET formation. We observed the morphological changes of cells with scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Then, the content of extracellular DNA and the expression of MPO and NE in each group were detected. The results showed that H<sub>2</sub>S inhibited the formation of NETs. The expression of miR-16-5p and its target genes PiK3R1 and RAF1 was then measured by qRT-PCR. H<sub>2</sub>S upregulated miR-16-5p and inhibited expression of the target genes PiK3R1 and RAF1, and it subsequently inhibited the Pi3K/AKT and ERK pathways and decreased respiratory burst levels. Furthermore, H<sub>2</sub>S attenuated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated endoplasmic reticulum calcium outflow as well as autophagy caused by PMA. This study enriches H<sub>2</sub>S immunotoxicity research and provides a possible solution for the treatment of NET-related diseases."	"Background Genetic testing is helpful for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mimics. Little data are available regarding the yield of such testing and its clinical impact. Methods The HCM genetic database at our center was used for identification of patients who underwent HCM-directed genetic testing including at least 1 gene associated with an HCM mimic (<i>GLA</i>, <i>TTR</i>, <i>PRKAG2</i>, <i>LAMP2</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, and <i>DES</i>). Charts were retrospectively reviewed and genetic and clinical data extracted. Results There were 1731 unrelated HCM patients who underwent genetic testing for at least 1 gene related to an HCM mimic. In 1.45% of cases, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in one of these genes was identified. This included a yield of 1% for Fabry disease, 0.3% for familial amyloidosis, 0.15% for <i>PRKAG2</i>-related cardiomyopathy, and 1 patient with Noonan syndrome. In the majority of patients, diagnosis of the HCM mimic based on clinical findings alone would have been challenging. Accurate diagnosis of an HCM mimic led to change in management (eg, enzyme replacement therapy) or family screening in all cases. Conclusions Genetic testing is helpful in the diagnosis of HCM mimics in patients with no or few extracardiac manifestations. Adding these genes to all HCM genetic panels should be considered."	"To determine the usefulness of a comprehensive, targeted-capture next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for the clinical management of children undergoing enucleation for retinoblastoma.Cohort study.Thirty-two children with retinoblastoma.We performed targeted NGS using the UCSF500 Cancer Panel (University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue along with constitutional DNA isolated from peripheral blood, buccal swab, or uninvolved optic nerve. Peripheral blood samples were also sent to a commercial laboratory for germline RB1 mutation testing.Presence or absence of germline RB1 mutation or deletion, tumor genetic profile, and association of genetic alterations with clinicopathologic features.Germline mutation or deletion of the RB1 gene was identified in all children with bilateral retinoblastoma (n = 12), and these NGS results were 100% concordant with commercial germline RB1 mutation analysis. In tumor tissue tested with NGS, biallelic inactivation of RB1 was identified in 28 tumors and focal MYCN amplification was identified in 4 tumors (2 with wild-type RB1 and 2 with biallelic RB1 inactivation). Additional likely pathogenic alterations beyond RB1 were identified in 13 tumors (41%), several of which have not been reported previously in retinoblastoma. These included focal amplifications of MDM4 and RAF1, as well as damaging mutations involving BCOR, ARID1A, MGA, FAT1, and ATRX. The presence of additional likely pathogenetic mutations beyond RB1 inactivation was associated with aggressive histopathologic features, including higher histologic grade and anaplasia, and also with both unilateral and sporadic disease.Comprehensive NGS analysis reliably detects relevant mutations, amplifications, and chromosomal copy number changes in retinoblastoma. The presence of genetic alterations beyond RB1 inactivation correlates with aggressive histopathologic features."	"Noonan syndrome is a common genetic disease characterized by peculiar face, short stature, congenital heart disease and thoracic deformity. The pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome is mainly related to abnormal Ras-MAPK signal pathway which involves more than 16 genes including (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1)] and KRAS. At present, there is a lack of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of Noonan syndrome in China. This guideline has summarized the clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment for Noonan syndrome, with an aim to improve the diagnostic level and clinical management of patients with this syndrome."	"A subset of melanomas is characterized by fusions involving genes that encode kinases. Melanomas with RAF1 fusions have been rarely reported, mostly in clinical literature. To investigate this distinctive group of melanomas, we searched for melanomas with activating structural variants in RAF1, utilizing our case archive of clinical samples with comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) by a hybrid capture-based DNA sequencing platform. Clinical data, pathology reports, and histopathology were reviewed for each case. RAF1 breakpoints, fusion partners, and co-occurring genetic alterations were characterized. From a cohort of 7119 melanomas, 40 cases (0.6%) featured fusions that created activating structural variants in RAF1. Cases with activating RAF1 fusions had median age of 62 years, were 58% male, and consisted of 9 primary tumors and 31 metastases. Thirty-nine cases were cutaneous primary, while one case was mucosal (anal) primary. Primary cutaneous melanomas showed variable architectures, including wedge-shaped and nodular growth patterns. Cytomorphology was predominantly epithelioid, with only one case, a desmoplastic melanoma, consisting predominantly of spindle cells. RAF1 5' rearrangement partners were predominantly intrachromosomal (n = 18), and recurrent partners included MAP4 (n = 3), CTNNA1 (n = 2), LRCH3 (n = 2), GOLGA4 (n = 2), CTDSPL (n = 2), and PRKAR2A (n = 2), all 5' of the region encoding the kinase domain. RAF1 breakpoints occurred in intron 7 (n = 32), intron 9 (n = 4), intron 5 (n = 2), and intron 6 (n = 2). Ninety-eight percent (n = 39) were wild type for BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 genomic alterations (triple wild type). Activating RAF1 fusions were present in 2.1% of triple wild-type melanomas overall (39/1882). In melanomas with activating RAF1 fusions, frequently mutated genes included TERTp (62%), CDKN2A (60%), TP53 (13%), ARID2 (10%), and PTEN (10%). Activating RAF1 fusions characterize a significant subset of triple wild-type melanoma (2.1%) with frequent accompanying mutations in TERTp and CDKN2A. CGP of melanomas may improve tumor classification and inform potential therapeutic options, such as consideration of specific kinase inhibitors."	"Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in men worldwide. An unusual but unique environment for studying tumor cell processes is provided by microgravity, either in space or simulated by ground-based devices like a random positioning machine (RPM). In this study, prostate adenocarcinoma-derived PC-3 cells were cultivated on an RPM for time periods of 3 and 5 days. We investigated the genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, extracellular matrix, growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The gene expression of signaling factors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathways was investigated using qPCR. We performed immunofluorescence to study the cytoskeleton, histological staining to examine the morphology, and a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay to analyze the cell culture supernatants. When PC-3 cells were exposed to simulated microgravity (s-µ<i>g</i>), some cells remained growing as adherent cells (AD), while most cells detached from the cell culture flask bottom and formed multicellular spheroids (MCS). After 3-day RPM exposure, PC-3 cells revealed significant downregulation of the <i>VEGF</i>, <i>SRC1</i>, <i>AKT</i>, <i>MTOR</i>, and <i>COL1A1</i> gene expression in MCS, whereas <i>FLT1</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, <i>MEK1</i>, <i>ERK1</i>, <i>FAK1</i>, <i>RICTOR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, and <i>TLN1</i> mRNAs were not significantly changed. <i>ERK2</i> and <i>TLN1</i> were elevated in AD, and <i>FLK1</i>, <i>LAMA3</i>, <i>COL4A5</i>, <i>FN1</i>, <i>VCL</i>, <i>CDH1</i>, and <i>NGAL</i> mRNAs were significantly upregulated in AD and MCS after 3 days. After a 5-day culture in s-µ<i>g</i>, the PC-3 cells showed significant downregulations of <i>VEGF</i> mRNA in AD and MCS, and <i>FN1</i>, <i>CDH1</i>, and <i>LAMA3</i> in AD and <i>SCR1</i> in MCS. In addition, we measured significant upregulations in <i>FLT1</i>, <i>AKT</i>, <i>ERK1</i>, <i>ERK2</i>, <i>LCN2</i>, <i>COL1A1</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, and <i>VCL</i> mRNAs in AD and MCS, and increases in <i>FLK1</i>, <i>FN1</i>, and <i>COL4A5</i> in MCS as well as <i>LAMB2</i>, <i>CDH1</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, <i>MEK1</i>, <i>SRC1</i>, and <i>M</i><i>TOR</i> mRNAs in AD. <i>FAK1</i> and <i>RICTOR</i> were not altered by s-µ<i>g</i>. In parallel, the secretion rate of VEGFA and NGAL proteins decreased. Cytoskeletal alterations (F-actin) were visible, as well as a deposition of collagen in the MCS. In conclusion, RPM-exposure of PC-3 cells induced changes in their morphology, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix protein synthesis, as well as in their focal adhesion complex and growth behavior. The significant upregulation of genes belonging to the PAM pathway indicated their involvement in the cellular changes occurring in microgravity."	"Over the last three decades, the scaffold proteins prohibitins-1 and -2 (PHB1/2) have emerged as key signaling proteins regulating a myriad of signaling pathways in health and diseases. Small molecules targeting PHBs display promising effects against cancers, osteoporosis, inflammatory, cardiac and neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides an updated overview of the various classes of PHB ligands, with an emphasis on their mechanism of action and therapeutic potential. We also describe how these ligands have been used to explore PHB signaling in different physiological and pathological settings."	"Red ginseng (RG) was recently reported to extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. However, the mechanism underlying this effect has not yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the RG-mediated prolongation of the lifespan of female D melanogaster. In this study, protein changes in 36-day-old female D melanogaster were identified using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), and levels of differentially expressed proteins were verified by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Our studies have shown that RG concentrations of 12.5, 15 and 17.5 mg/mL significantly prolonged the lifespan. Eleven proteins were up-regulated and 46 were down-regulated between the RG and control groups; and Pebp1 expression was significantly down-regulated. In addition, AKT and p-AKT were down-regulated, and ERK, p-ERK and Raf1 were up-regulated by RG. Therefore, RG significantly prolonged the lifespan of female D melanogaster by reducing the expression of Pebp1, up-regulating ERK and inhibiting the AKT pathway. RG may be a potential drug for anti-ageing treatment."	"Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is one of the developmental disorders caused by a dysregulation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. RASopathies share overlapping clinical features, making the diagnosis challenging, especially in the newborn period. The majority of CFC syndrome cases arise by a mutation in the <i>BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2</i>, or (rarely) <i>KRAS</i> genes. Germline <i>KRAS</i> mutations are identified in a minority of CFC and Noonan syndrome cases. Here, we describe a patient with a <i>KRAS</i> mutation presenting with a CFC syndrome phenotype. The female patient was referred for genetic testing because of congenital exophthalmos. Her facial appearance is distinctive with a coarse face, exophthalmos, ptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, deep philtrum, downturned corners of the mouth, and a short neck. She suffered from feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and developmental delay. The sequencing of the genes involved in the MAPK pathway (<i>PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1, SHOC2, CBL, and SPRED1</i>) identified a heterozygous de novo NM_004985.4:c.173C&gt;T (p.Thr58Ile) in the <i>KRAS</i> gene. Germline <i>KRAS</i> mutations have been identified in approximately 2% of the reported NS cases and less than 5% of the reported CFC syndrome cases. Because CFC and Noonan syndrome share clinical overlapping features, the phenotype caused by <i>KRAS</i> mutations is often difficult to assign to one of the 2 entities. The mutation that we detected in our patient was previously reported in a patient with an Noonan syndrome phenotype. However, our patient predominantly exhibits CFC clinical features. In our case, coarse facial appearance and severe developmental delay help discriminate CFC from Noonan syndrome. Thus, patient follow-up, especially for delayed motor milestones suspected from RASopathies, is important for the discrimination of overlapping conditions as in the abovementioned syndromes."	"The RASSF1A tumour suppressor is a scaffold protein that is involved in cell signalling. Increasing evidence shows that this protein sits at the crossroad of a complex signalling network, which includes key regulators of cellular homeostasis, such as Ras, MST2/Hippo, p53, and death receptor pathways. The loss of expression of RASSF1A is one of the most common events in solid tumours and is usually caused by gene silencing through DNA methylation. Thus, re-expression of RASSF1A or therapeutic targeting of effector modules of its complex signalling network, is a promising avenue for treating several tumour types. Here, we review the main modules of the RASSF1A signalling network and the evidence for the effects of network deregulation in different cancer types. In particular, we summarise the epigenetic mechanism that mediates RASSF1A promoter methylation and the Hippo and RAF1 signalling modules. Finally, we discuss different strategies that are described for re-establishing RASSF1A function and how a multitargeting pathway approach selecting druggable nodes in this network could lead to new cancer treatments."	"Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been considered as potentially critical regulators in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this study, we prospectively investigate the effect and mechanism of lncRNA integrin subunit beta 2-anti-sense RNA 1 (ITGB2-AS1) on regulation of PDAC progression. The expression of ITGB2-AS1 and its target were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-z-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell assays were used to investigate the influence of ITGB2-AS1 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion, respectively. The interaction between ITGB2-AS1 and its target was determined via luciferase activity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. The subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model was established and employed to detect the tumorigenic function of ITGB2-AS1, which was evaluated by western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results showed that ITGB2-AS1 was elevated in both PDAC tumor tissues and cell lines, predicting a poor prognosis in PDAC patients. Knocking down of ITGB2-AS1 suppressed PDAC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration but induced cell apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, ITGB2-AS1 could target and inhibit the expression of miR-4319 and miR-4319-targeted and -suppressed serine/threonine kinase RAF1. ITGB2-AS1 promoted PDAC progression via inhibition of miR-4319. Interference of ITGB2-AS1 could suppress in vivo tumorigenic ability of PDAC via downregulation of RAF1. In conclusion, ITGB2-AS1 promoted PDAC progression via sponging miR-4319 to upregulate RAF1, suggesting the potential therapeutic target ability of ITGB2-AS1 in PDAC."
"RIT1"	"Noonan syndrome"	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by characteristic facies, short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, unusual chest shape with superior pectus carinatum and inferior pectus excavatum, cryptorchidism, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities. Although birth length is usually normal, final adult height approaches the lower limit of normal. Congenital heart disease occurs in 50%-80% of individuals. Pulmonary valve stenosis, often with dysplasia, is the most common heart defect and is found in 20%-50% of individuals. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, found in 20%-30% of individuals, may be present at birth or develop in infancy or childhood. Other structural defects include atrial and ventricular septal defects, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Up to one fourth of affected individuals have mild intellectual disability, and language impairments in general are more common in NS than in the general population.NS is diagnosed on clinical grounds by observation of key features. Affected individuals have normal chromosome studies. Molecular genetic testing identifies a pathogenic variant in <i>PTPN11</i> in 50% of affected individuals, <i>SOS1</i> in approximately 13%, <i>RAF1</i> and <i>RIT1</i> each in 5%, and <i>KRAS</i> in fewer than 5%. Other reported genes – in which pathogenic variants have been found to cause Noonan syndrome in fewer than 1% of cases – include <i>BRAF</i>, <i>LZTR1</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, and <i>NRAS</i>. Several additional genes associated with a Noonan-syndrome-like phenotype in fewer than ten individuals have been identified.<i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Cardiovascular anomalies in NS are usually treated as in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding is guided by knowledge of the specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomaly. Growth hormone (GH) treatment increases growth velocity. <i>Surveillance:</i> Monitoring of anomalies found in any system, especially cardiovascular abnormalities.NS is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. While many individuals with autosomal dominant NS have a <i>de novo</i> pathogenic variant, an affected parent is recognized in 30%-75% of families. The risk to sibs of a proband with autosomal dominant NS depends on the genetic status of the parents: if a parent is affected, the risk is 50%; when the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low (&lt;1%). Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. NS caused by pathogenic variants in <i>LZTR1</i> can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive NS are typically heterozygotes (i.e., have one <i>LZTR1</i> pathogenic variant), and may either be asymptomatic or have mild features of NS. If both parents are heterozygous for one <i>LZTR1</i> pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of having one <i>LZTR1</i> pathogenic variant (which can be associated with mild NS features), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal testing is possible if the NS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is caused by mutations in more than 10 genes, mainly PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and RIT1. Congenital heart defects and cardiomyopathy (CMP) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in NS. Although hypertrophic CMP has &quot;classically&quot; been reported in association to RAF1, RIT1, and PTPN11 variants, SOS1 appears to be poorly related to CMP. Patients with NS attending our Center from January 2013 to June 2018 were eligible for inclusion if they carried SOS1 variants and presented with-or developed-CMP. Literature review describing the co-existence of SOS1 mutation and CMP was also performed. We identified six patients with SOS1 variants and CMP (male to female ratio 2:1) including two novel variants. CMP spectrum encompassed: (a) dilated CMP, (b) nonobstructive hypertrophic CMPs, and (c) obstructive hypertrophic CMPs. Survival is 100%. Literature review included 16 SOS1 mutated in CMP. CMP, mainly hypertrophic, has been often reported in association to RAF1, RIT1, and PTPN11 variants. Differently from previous reports, due to the frequent association of SOS1 variants and CMP in our single center experience, we suggest potential underestimated proportion of SOS1 in pediatric CMPs."	"NS and related RAS/MAPK pathway (RASopathy) disorders are the leading genetic cause of HCM presenting in infancy. HCM is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with Noonan spectrum disorders, especially in the first year of life. Previously, there have been only isolated reports of heart transplantation as a treatment for heart failure in NS. We report on 18 patients with NS disorders who underwent heart transplantation at seven US pediatric heart transplant centers. All patients carried a NS diagnosis: 15 were diagnosed with NS and three with NSML. Sixteen of eighteen patients had comprehensive molecular genetic testing for RAS pathway mutations, with 15 having confirmed pathogenic mutations in PTPN11, RAF1, and RIT1 genes. Medical aspects of transplantation are reported as well as NS-specific medical issues. Twelve of eighteen patients described in this series were surviving at the time of data collection. Three patients died following transplantation prior to discharge from the hospital, and another three died post-discharge. Heart transplantation in NS may be a more frequent occurrence than is evident from the literature or registry data. A mortality rate of 33% is consistent with previous reports of patients with HCM transplanted in infancy and early childhood. Specific considerations may be important in evaluation of this population for heart transplant, including a potentially increased risk for malignancies as well as lymphatic, bleeding, and coagulopathy complications."	"Ras-like-without-CAAX-1 (RIT1) belongs to the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, which plays critical roles in tumor progression. However, little is known about the roles of RIT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we found that RIT1 expression was positively associated with the presence of intrahepatic metastasis and the histological grade of HCC and higher RIT1 expression indicated shorter overall survival in HCC patients. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that RIT1 functioned as an oncogene, as overexpression of RIT1 enhanced HCC cell proliferation and aggressive behavior, whereas silencing RIT1 expression repressed the malignant behaviors. Furthermore, RIT1 deficiency increased drug sensitivity to sorafenib treatment. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) directly transcriptionally upregulated RIT1, and its stableness was positively correlated with RIT1 expression in HCC tissues. Knockdown of RIT1 attenuated the invasion and migration induced by hypoxia. Collectively, our data highlight the significance of HIF-1α/RIT1 axis in driving HCC progression and sorafenib resistance."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a common autosomal dominant/recessive disorder. No large-scale study has been conducted on NS in China, which is the most populous country in the world. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify pathogenic variants in patients that exhibited NS-related phenotypes. We assessed the facial features and clinical manifestations of patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. Gene-related Chinese NS facial features were described using artificial intelligence (AI).NGS identified pathogenic variants in 103 Chinese patients in eight NS-related genes: PTPN11 (48.5%), SOS1 (12.6%), SHOC2 (11.7%), KRAS (9.71%), RAF1 (7.77%), RIT1 (6.8%), CBL (0.97%), NRAS (0.97%), and LZTR1 (0.97%). Gene-related facial representations showed that each gene was associated with different facial details. Eight novel pathogenic variants were detected and clinical features because of specific genetic variants were reported, including hearing loss, cancer risk due to a PTPN11 pathogenic variant, and ubiquitous abnormal intracranial structure due to SHOC2 pathogenic variants. NGS facilitates the diagnosis of NS, especially for patients with mild/moderate and atypical symptoms. Our study describes the genotypic and phenotypic spectra of NS in China, providing new insights into distinctive clinical features due to specific pathogenic variants."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a diagnosis that is made clinically based on features including typical facies, congenital heart defects, short stature and developmental delay. Approximately 50% of the patients have identified mutations in the PTPN11 gene, and a smaller percentage of mutations have been reported in other genes such as SOS1, RAF1 and RIT1 Despite normal birth length, patients typically reach adult height below normal. Other than growth, endocrine complications of NS are not as commonly reported. These include possible pathology in thyroid function, pubertal development and bone metabolism. Some investigators have looked to see if genetic mutations in these patients could pose a risk for future endocrinopathies. This chapter reviews reports on endocrine dysfunction other than growth in patients with NS. The information is meant to enhance awareness in those providers who care for these patients to the possibility of other existing endocrinopathies. Most importantly, it supports and highlights the endocrinologist's role in the care of patients with NS."	"Knowledge of interaction network between different proteins can be a useful tool in cancer therapy. To develop new therapeutic treatments, understanding how these proteins contribute to dysregulated cellular pathways is an important task. PARP1 inhibitors are drugs used in cancer therapy, in particular where DNA repair is defective. It is crucial to find new candidate interactors of PARP1 as new therapeutic targets in order to increase efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors and expand their clinical utility. By a yeast-based genome wide screening, we previously discovered 90 candidate deletion genes that suppress growth-inhibition phenotype conferred by PARP1 in yeast. Here, we performed an integrated and computational analysis to deeply study these genes. First, we identified which pathways these genes are involved in and putative relations with PARP1 through g:Profiler. Then, we studied mutation pattern and their relation to cancer by interrogating COSMIC and DisGeNET database; finally, we evaluated expression and alteration in several cancers with cBioPortal, and the interaction network with GeneMANIA. We identified 12 genes belonging to PARP1-related pathways. We decided to further validate RIT1, INCENP and PSTA1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. We found that RIT1 and INCENP affected PARylation and PARP1 protein level more significantly in PARP1 inhibited cells. Furthermore, downregulation of RIT1, INCENP and PSAT1 affected olaparib sensitivity of MCF7 cells. Our study identified candidate genes that could have an effect on PARP inhibition therapy. Moreover, we also confirm that yeast-based screenings could be very helpful to identify novel potential therapy factors."	"Noonan Syndrome (NS) is a common autosomal dominant multisystem disorder, caused by mutations in more than 10 genes in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Differential mutation frequencies are observed across populations. Clinical expressions of NS are highly variable and include short stature, distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism, cardiovascular abnormalities, and developmental delay. Little is known about phenotypic specificities and molecular characteristics of NS in Africa. The present study has investigated patients with NS in Cape Town (South Africa). Clinical features were carefully documented in a total of 26 patients. Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on 16 unrelated probands, using a multigene panel comprising 14 genes: <i>PTPN11, SOS1, RIT1, A2ML1, BRAF, CBL, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, NRAS, RAF1, SHOC2</i>, and <i>SPRED1</i>. The median age at diagnosis was 4.5 years (range: 1 month-51 years). Individuals of mixed-race ancestry were most represented (53.8%), followed by black Africans (30.8%). Our cohort revealed a lower frequency of pulmonary valve stenosis (34.6%) and a less severe developmental milestones phenotype. Molecular analysis found variants predicted to be pathogenic in 5 / 16 cases (31.2%). Among these mutations, two were previously reported: <i>MAP2K1</i>-c.389A&gt;G (p.Tyr130Cys) and <i>PTPN11</i> - c.1510A&gt;G (p.Met504Val); three are novel: <i>CBL</i>-c.2520T&gt;G (p.Cys840Trp), <i>PTPN11</i>- c.1496C&gt;T (p.Ser499Phe), and <i>MAP2K1</i>- c.200A&gt;C (p.Asp67Ala). Molecular dynamic simulations indicated that novel variants identified impact the stability and flexibility of their corresponding proteins. Genotype-phenotype correlations showed that clinical features of NS were more typical in patients with variants in <i>MAP2K1</i>. This first application of targeted NGS for the molecular diagnosis of NS in South Africans suggests that, while there is no major phenotypic difference compared to other populations, the distribution of genetic variants in NS in South Africans may be different."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder characterized by short stature, a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects. We recently discovered a novel NS gene, RIT1, which is a member of the RAS subfamily of small GTPases. NS patients with RIT1 mutations have a high incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and edematous phenotype, but the specific role of RIT1 remains unclear.To investigate how germline RIT1 mutations cause NS, we generated knock-in mice that carried a NS-associated Rit1 A57G mutation (Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup>). We investigated the phenotypes of Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup> mice in fetal and adult stages as well as the effects of isoproterenol on cardiac function in Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup> mice.Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup> embryos exhibited decreased viability, edema, subcutaneous hemorrhage and AKT activation. Surviving Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup> mice had a short stature, craniofacial abnormalities and splenomegaly. Cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis with increased expression of S100A4, vimentin and periostin were observed in Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup> mice compared to Rit1<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Upon isoproterenol stimulation, cardiac fibrosis was drastically increased in Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup> mice. Phosphorylated (at Thr308) AKT levels were also elevated in isoproterenol-treated Rit1<sup>A57G/+</sup> hearts.The A57G mutation in Rit1 causes cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and other NS-associated features. Biochemical analysis indicates that the AKT signaling pathway might be related to downstream signaling in the RIT1 A57G mutant at a developmental stage and under β-adrenergic stimulation in the heart.

"RIT1 oncoproteins have emerged as an etiologic factor in Noonan syndrome and cancer. Despite the resemblance of RIT1 to other members of the Ras small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), mutations affecting RIT1 are not found in the classic hotspots but rather in a region near the switch II domain of the protein. We used an isogenic germline knock-in mouse model to study the effects of RIT1 mutation at the organismal level, which resulted in a phenotype resembling Noonan syndrome. By mass spectrometry, we detected a RIT1 interactor, leucine zipper-like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1), that acts as an adaptor for protein degradation. Pathogenic mutations affecting either RIT1 or LZTR1 resulted in incomplete degradation of RIT1. This led to RIT1 accumulation and dysregulated growth factor signaling responses. Our results highlight a mechanism of pathogenesis that relies on impaired protein degradation of the Ras GTPase RIT1."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that belongs to a group of developmental disorders called RASopathies with overlapping features and multiple causative genes. The aim of the study was to identify mutations underlying this disorder in patients from Southeast Asia and characterize their clinical presentations.Patients were identified from the hospital's Genetics clinics after assessment by attending clinical geneticists. A targeted gene panel was used for next-generation sequencing on genomic DNA extracted from the blood samples of 17 patients.Heterozygous missense variants were identified in 13 patients: eight were in PTPN11, three in SOS1, and one each in RIT1 and KRAS. All are known variants that have been reported in patients with NS. Of the 13 patients with identified variants, 10 had short stature, the most common feature for NS. Four of the eight patients with PTPN11 variants had atrial septal defect. Only two had pulmonary stenosis which is reported to be common for PTPN11 mutation carriers. Another two had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a feature which is negatively associated with PTPN11 mutations.Our study provides the mutation and phenotypic spectrum of NS from a new population group. The molecular testing yield of 76% is similar to other studies and shows that the targeted panel approach is useful for identifying genetic mutations in NS which has multiple causative genes. The molecular basis for the phenotypes of the remaining patients remains unknown and would need to be uncovered via sequencing of additional genes or other investigative methods."	"The RASopathies are a class of developmental disorders caused by germline mutations in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been frequently described in children with RASopathy, but only a minority of patients have received formal genotyping. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic basis and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with RASopathy-associated HCM.We retrospectively reviewed the mutation spectrum and clinical outcome of all the patients with RASopathy derived from 168 pediatric HCM cases referred to our institution between January 2012 and July 2018.A heterozygous missense mutation in one of known RASopathy genes was identified in 46 unrelated children with HCM. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene were the most prevalent (19/46); this was followed by mutations in RAF1 (11/46), KRAS (5/46), RIT1 (4/46), BRAF (3/46), SOS1 (2/46), HRAS (1/46), and SHOC2 (1/46). Moreover, two compound heterozygous missense mutations in the LZTR1 gene were identified in one patient with the Noonan syndrome phenotype and HCM. The median age at the diagnosis of HCM was 3.0 months (range 0 months to 8.1 years). Twenty-one of the patients had significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and 32 had concomitant congenital heart disease. Three patients with a mutation in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene died of cardiac failure at the ages of 3.0, 3.5, and 6.0 months. The remaining 44 patients were alive after an average follow-up time of 3.9 years (0.5 to 17.1 years, median 2.9 years) from the initial diagnosis of HCM, including 5 patients with spontaneous regression of their cardiac hypertrophy.RASopathy-associated HCM is a heterogeneous genetic condition characterized by early-onset cardiac hypertrophy and a high prevalence of co-existing congenital heart disease, which is most frequently related to specific mutations in the PTPN11 gene. Rapidly progressive HCM, resulting in an early death, is uncommon in RASopathy patients except those with specific mutations in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene."	"This study aimed to identify the cancer stem cell specific biomarkers that can be effective candidate prognosticators of oral squamous cell carcinoma.Microarray-based meta-analysis derived transcriptional profile of head and neck cancers was compared with the Cancer Stem Cell database to arrive at a subset of markers. This subset was further co-related with clinico-pathological parameters, recurrence and survival of oral cancer patients (n = 313) in The Cancer Genome Atlas database and in oral cancer (n = 28) patients.Meta-analysis in combination with database comparison identified a panel of 221 genes specific to head and neck cancers. Correlation of expression levels of these markers in the oral cancer cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 313) with treatment outcome identified 54 genes (p &lt; 0.05 or fold change &gt;2) associated with disease recurrence, 8 genes (NQO1, UBE2C, EDNRB, FKBP4, STAT3, HOXA1, RIT1, AURKA) being significant with high fold change. Assessment of the efficacy of the subset (n = 54) as survival predictors identified an additional 4 genes (CDK1, GINS2, PHF5 A, ERBB2) that co-related with poor disease-free survival (p &lt; 0.05). CDK1 showed a significant association with the clinical stage, margin status and with advanced pathological parameters. Initial patient validation indicated that CDK1 and NQO1 significantly co-related with the poor disease-free and overall survival (p &lt; 0.05).This panel of oral cancer specific, cancer stem cell associated markers identified in this study, a subset of which was validated, will be of clinical benefit subject to large scale validation studies."	"The study sought to explore novel genetic aberration driving squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC). The whole exome (WES), whole genome (WGS) and target region (TS) sequencings and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques were integrated to explore and validate novel targeting candidates from LUSC primary tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Seven genes (FGFR2, GRM1,PIK3CG, PIK3CA,ZFHX4, CSMD3, GRM8) with high frequencies of both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs), and two genes (CLDN1 and RIT1) only with CNVs were identified by bioinformatics analysis. The functions of these candidates were validated through CRISPR-Cas9 system in primary PDX cells. Furthermore, we focused on the genetic and functional analysis of Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (GRM8), whose transcriptional activation was elucidated to promote the survival of LUSC tumor cell through inhibiting cAMP pathway and activating MAPK pathway. The SNV identified in GRM8, A112G, activated downstream signaling pathway and induced cell proliferation, which could be reversed by cAMP stimulator and MEK inhibitor. In conclusion, the components of GRM8 signaling pathway could serve as potential targets of squamous cell lung cancer carrying GRM8 activating variants."	"Ras-like without CAAX1 (RIT1) protein is a member of Ras family, which plays critical roles in signaling pathways and cellular process regulation. However, the role of RIT1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of RIT1 is downregulated in ESCC compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues. The low-level expression of RIT1 was correlated with poorer prognosis. Then we showed that RIT1 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of ESCC cells, and silencing RIT1 by shRNA promoted tumorigenicity and metastasis in nude mice. We further demonstrated that RIT1 inhibited the malignant behaviors of ESCC through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ESCC cells. Our study also revealed that RIT1 increased drug sensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP), and this function could be carried out through downregulating stemness of ESCC. In conclusion, our study indicates for the first time that RIT1 displays tumor-suppressing functions in ESCC, and these functions were carried out by inhibiting MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting EMT, and downregulating cancer stemness of ESCC cells."	"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and genetic characteristics of a Chinese boy with Verheij syndrome and review the literature. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical and genetic data of a Chinese boy with Verheij syndrome, who was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in May 2017 were analyzed. Original papers on Verheij syndrome published up to January 2018 were retrieved at PubMed, Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man(OMIM), CNKI and WanFang databases by using the key words &quot;Verheij syndrome&quot; and &quot;PUF60&quot; . <b>Results:</b> The male patient (at the age of 14 years and 3 months) visited us because of growth retardation for 13 years. Atrial septal defect was repaired at the age 3. Congenital amblyopia and hyperopia were diagnosed at the age 4. On physical examination, serious growth retardation and delayed psychomotor development was noted. His height was 142.5 cm (-3.26 SDS). He had poor academic performance at school. Facial features included: webbed neck, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, thin upper lip, and high palate. Palmar crease was found in the right hand. His bone age was 10 years. Growth hormone stimulation test indicated partial growth hormone deficiency (growth hormone (GH) peak 6.63 μg/L). The level of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) was lower than normal, 73.20 μg/L and 2 500 μg/L respectively. Abdominal ultrasound showed that the volumes of bilateral kidneys were small. The size of the left and right kidney was 8.5 cm × 3.3 cm and 8.4 cm × 4.3 cm respectively. Karyotype was normal (46, XY). MRI of pituitary showed partial empty sella turcica. Ten genes associated with Noonan syndrome (PTPN11, SOS1, RASA2, KRAS, RAF1, NRAS, SHOC2, BRAF, RIT1, A2ML1) were analyzed and no genetic mutations were found. Whole exome-sequencing analysis identified a de novo heterozygous frame shift mutation of PUF60 gene (c.931_934del, P.P.T 311Qfs*47). According to ACMG guidelines in 2015, the mutation is pathogenic and has not been reported in the above databases. <b>Conclusions:</b> This is the first case report of Verheij syndrome caused by mutation of PUF60 gene in Chinese population. It is difficult to discriminate Verheij syndrome from Noonan syndrome, both have clinical manifestations such as severe growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, and congenital heart disease. In addition to Noonan syndrome, PUF60 genetic analysis was recommended for avoiding missed diagnosis with such clinical manifestations of patients."	"To provide information on the scope of cardiac disease in Noonan syndrome.Noonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant RASopathy disorder characterized by clinical findings of facial dysmorphism, congenital heart disease, and short stature. The degree of genetic heterogeneity has recently become evident in that Noonan syndrome is now known to be caused by mutations in a large variety of genes which produce dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway. The scope of cardiac disease in Noonan syndrome is quite variable depending on the gene mutation, with some mutations usually associated with a high incidence of congenital heart defects (PTPN11, KRAS, and others) while those with predominantly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have higher risk and morbidity profiles (RAF1, RIT1, and those associated with multiple lentigines).Cardiac disease in Noonan syndrome varies according to the type of gene mutation. The most common forms of cardiac disease include pulmonary stenosis, HCM, and atrial septal defect. HCM in general is associated with increased risk, mortality, and morbidity. New concepts for potential treatments are discussed."	"Ras-like without CAAX 1 (RIT1/Rit) is a member of the Ras subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins with documented roles in regulating neuronal function, including contributions to neurotrophin signaling, neuronal survival, and neurogenesis. The aim of the study was to (1) examine the expression of RIT1 protein in mouse retina and retinal cell types and (2) determine whether RIT1 contributes to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and synaptic stability following excitotoxic stress.Gene expression and immunohistochemical analysis were used to examine RIT1 expression in the mouse retina. Primary RGC and Müller glia cultures were used to validate novel RIT1 lentiviral RNAi silencing reagents, and to demonstrate that RIT1 loss does not alter RGC morphology. Finally, in vitro glutamate exposure identified a role for RIT1 in the adaptation of RGCs to excitotoxic stress.Gene expression analysis and immunohistochemical studies in whole eyes and primary cell culture demonstrate RIT1 expression throughout the retina, including Müller glia and RGCs. While genetic RIT1 knockout (RIT1-KO) does not affect gross retinal anatomy, including the thickness of constituent retinal layers or RGC cell numbers, RNAi-mediated RIT1 silencing results in increased RGC death and synaptic loss following exposure to excitotoxic stress.RIT1 is widely expressed in the murine retina, including both Müller glia and RGCs. While genetic deletion of RIT1 does not result in gross retinal abnormalities, these studies identify a novel role for RIT1 in the adaptation of RGC to excitotoxic stress, with RIT1 promoting both neuronal survival and the retention of PSD-95<sup>+</sup> synapses."

"RRAS2"	"Noonan syndrome"	"Background This study aimed to investigate the completing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involved in childhood obesity. Methods The microarray dataset GSE9624 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (DELs) and messenger RNAs (DEMs) were isolated between the childhood obesity and non-obesity tissue samples. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) functional and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of isolated DEMs were performed. DELs and DEMs targeted miRNAs were predicted to construct a ceRNA regulatory network. Finally, critical lncRNAs were validated in another dataset. Results A total of 1257 differentially expressed RNAs were screened, including 28 lncRNAs and 1229 mRNAs. In addition, these RNAs were mainly involved in defense response, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, apoptosis, etc. Three lncRNAs (human leukocyte antigen complex 5 [HCP5], long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 839 [LINC00839] and receptor activity modifying protein 2 [RAMP2-AS1]) and two related miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p and hsa-miR-27a/b-3p) were identified as key RNAs in childhood obesity. Specifically, lncRNA HCP5 interacted with miR-17-5p and miR-27a/b to regulate nemo-like kinase (NLK) and Ras-related protein 2 (RRAS2) via the MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, four genes (RRAS2, NLK, bcl2/adenovirus E1B protein-interacting protein 3 [BNIP3] and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 [PMAIP1]) targeted by miRNAs were predicted as critical genes and might be novel diagnostic biomarkers of childhood obesity. Conclusions lncRNA HCP5 could serve as a ceRNA sponging miR-17-5p and miR-27a/b to regulate the pathogenesis of childhood obesity via NLK and RRAS2 in the MAPK signaling pathway."	"Aberrant function of RRAS2 drives malignant transformation in a various of cancers. However, little information exists on the function of RRAS2 in tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma. In this study, we investigated the effect of RRAS2 on osteosarcoma progression and its underlying mechanism. The gene expression level and prognostic power of RRAS2 in osteosarcoma were first investigated using the data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Then RNA interference was performed to silence the expression of RRAS2 in osteosarcoma cells. Quantitative real-time-PCR and western blot were used to examine the gene and protein expressions of RRAS2 in osteosarcoma cells. In-vitro cancer proliferation and migration were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolum bromide solution and wound-healing assays, respectively. We found that RRAS2 was significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma cells and high expression of RRAS2 was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma. RNA interference decreased the gene and protein expression of RRAS2, reduced in-vitro the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells, and suppressed the activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. RRAS2 as an adverse prognostic factor promoted cell proliferation and migration by activating the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and may provide new therapeutic value for osteosarcoma."	"Signal strength controls the outcome of αβ T cell selection in the thymus, resulting in death if the affinity of the rearranged TCR is below the threshold for positive selection, or if the affinity of the TCR is above the threshold for negative selection. Here we show that deletion of the GTPase RRAS2 results in exacerbated negative selection and above-normal expression of positive selection markers. Furthermore, <i>Rras2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice are resistant to autoimmunity both in a model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in a model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that MOG-specific T cells in <i>Rras2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice have reduced affinity for MOG/I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers, suggesting that enhanced negative selection leads to selection of TCRs with lower affinity for the self-MOG peptide. An analysis of the TCR repertoire shows alterations that mostly affect the TCRα variable (TRAV) locus with specific VJ combinations and CDR3α sequences that are absent in <i>Rras2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, suggesting their involvement in autoimmunity."	"The antioxidant effect of salidroside has been proven, but its role in liver injury is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the protective effects and mechanism of salidroside on liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) in vivo. Mice were pretreated with salidroside (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally injected, i.p.) once per day for 14 consecutive days and then administered with CCl<sub>4</sub> (15.95 g/kg, i.p.) for 24 h to produce a liver injury model. Salidroside attenuated hepatic transaminase elevation in serum and ameliorated liver steatosis and necrosis, thereby suggesting its protective effect on the liver. Salidroside antagonized CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced toxicity by equilibrating antioxidation system, thereby inhibiting reactive oxygen species accumulation, and restoring mitochondrial structure and function. Salidroside exerts antioxidant and liver-protective effects by selectively inhibiting the activation of genes, including growth arrest and DNA -damage-inducible 45 α (Gadd45a), mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (Mapk7), and related RAS viral oncogene homolog 2 (Rras2), which induce oxidative stress in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These results revealed that salidroside can protect the liver from CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced injury by resisting oxidative stress and protecting mitochondrial function."	"Molecular network changes are the hallmark of the pathogenesis of ovarian cancers (OCs). Network-based biomarkers benefit for the effective treatment of OC.This study sought to identify key pathway-network alterations and network-based biomarkers for clarification of molecular mechanisms and treatment of OCs.Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) platform was used to mine signaling pathway networks with 1198 human tissue mitochondrial differentially expressed proteins (mtDEPs) and compared those pathway network changes between OCs and controls. The mtDEPs in important cancer-related pathway systems were further validated with qRT-PCR and Western blot in OC cell models. Moreover, integrative analysis of mtDEPs and Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data from 419 patients was used to identify hub molecules with molecular complex detection method. Hub molecule-based survival analysis and multiple multivariate regression analysis were used to identify survival-related hub molecules and hub molecule signature model.Pathway network analysis revealed 25 statistically significant networks, 192 canonical pathways, and 5 significant molecular/cellular function models. A total of 52 canonical pathways were activated or inhibited in cancer pathogenesis, including antigen presentation, mitochondrial dysfunction, GP6 signaling, EIF2 signaling, and glutathione-mediated detoxification. Of them, mtDEPs (TPM1, CALR, GSTP1, LYN, AKAP12, and CPT2) in those canonical pathway and molecular/cellular models were validated in OC cell models at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, 102 hub molecules were identified, and they were regulated by post-translational modifications and functioned in multiple biological processes. Of them, 62 hub molecules were individually significantly related to OC survival risk. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis of 102 hub molecules identified significant seven hub molecule signature models (HIST1H2BK, ALB, RRAS2, HIBCH, EIF3E, RPS20, and RPL23A) to assess OC survival risks.These findings provided the overall signaling pathway network profiling of human OCs; offered scientific data to discover pathway network-based cancer biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of OCs; and clarify accurate molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets. These findings benefit for the discovery of effective and reliable biomarkers based on pathway networks for OC predictive and personalized medicine."	"Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by distinctive craniofacial appearance, short stature, and congenital heart disease. Approximately 80% of individuals with NS harbor mutations in genes whose products are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, the underlying genetic causes in nearly 20% of individuals with NS phenotype remain unexplained. Here, we report four de novo RRAS2 variants in three individuals with NS. RRAS2 is a member of the RAS subfamily and is ubiquitously expressed. Three variants, c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup), c.216A&gt;T (p.Gln72His), and c.215A&gt;T (p.Gln72Leu), have been found in cancers; our functional analyses showed that these three changes induced elevated association of RAF1 and that they activated ERK1/2 and ELK1. Notably, prominent activation of ERK1/2 and ELK1 by p.Gln72Leu associates with the severe phenotype of the individual harboring this change. To examine variant pathogenicity in vivo, we generated zebrafish models. Larvae overexpressing c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup) or c.216A&gt;T (p.Gln72His) variants, but not wild-type RRAS2 RNAs, showed craniofacial defects and macrocephaly. The same dose injection of mRNA encoding c.215A&gt;T (p.Gln72Leu) caused severe developmental impairments and low dose overexpression of this variant induced craniofacial defects. In contrast, the RRAS2 c.224T&gt;G (p.Phe75Cys) change, located on the same allele with p.Gln72His in an individual with NS, resulted in no aberrant in vitro or in vivo phenotypes by itself. Together, our findings suggest that activating RRAS2 mutations can cause NS and expand the involvement of RRAS2 proto-oncogene to rare germline disorders."	"Aberrant signaling through pathways controlling cell response to extracellular stimuli constitutes a central theme in disorders affecting development. Signaling through RAS and the MAPK cascade controls a variety of cell decisions in response to cytokines, hormones, and growth factors, and its upregulation causes Noonan syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder whose major features include a distinctive facies, a wide spectrum of cardiac defects, short stature, variable cognitive impairment, and predisposition to malignancies. NS is genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in more than ten genes have been reported to underlie this disorder. Despite the large number of genes implicated, about 10%-20% of affected individuals with a clinical diagnosis of NS do not have mutations in known RASopathy-associated genes, indicating that additional unidentified genes contribute to the disease, when mutated. By using a mixed strategy of functional candidacy and exome sequencing, we identify RRAS2 as a gene implicated in NS in six unrelated subjects/families. We show that the NS-causing RRAS2 variants affect highly conserved residues localized around the nucleotide binding pocket of the GTPase and are predicted to variably affect diverse aspects of RRAS2 biochemical behavior, including nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, and interaction with effectors. Additionally, all pathogenic variants increase activation of the MAPK cascade and variably impact cell morphology and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Finally, we provide a characterization of the clinical phenotype associated with RRAS2 mutations."	"Radiotherapy improves survival for common childhood cancers such as medulloblastoma, leukemia, and germ cell tumors. Unfortunately, long-term survivors suffer sequelae that can include secondary neoplasia. Gliomas are common secondary neoplasms after cranial or craniospinal radiation, most often manifesting as high-grade astrocytomas with poor clinical outcomes. Here, we performed genetic profiling on a cohort of 12 gliomas arising after therapeutic radiation to determine their molecular pathogenesis and assess for differences in genomic signature compared to their spontaneous counterparts. We identified a high frequency of TP53 mutations, CDK4 amplification or CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and amplifications or rearrangements involving receptor tyrosine kinase and Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway genes including PDGFRA, MET, BRAF, and RRAS2. Notably, all tumors lacked alterations in IDH1, IDH2, H3F3A, HIST1H3B, HIST1H3C, TERT (including promoter region), and PTEN, which genetically define the major subtypes of diffuse gliomas in children and adults. All gliomas in this cohort had very low somatic mutation burden (less than three somatic single nucleotide variants or small indels per Mb). The ten high-grade gliomas demonstrated markedly aneuploid genomes, with significantly increased quantity of intrachromosomal copy number breakpoints and focal amplifications/homozygous deletions compared to spontaneous high-grade gliomas, likely as a result of DNA double-strand breaks induced by gamma radiation. Together, these findings demonstrate a distinct molecular pathogenesis of secondary gliomas arising after radiation therapy and identify a genomic signature that may aid in differentiating these tumors from their spontaneous counterparts."	"Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) domain inhibitors (BETis) show efficacy on NUT midline carcinoma (NMC). However, not all NMC patients respond, and responders eventually develop resistance and relapse. Using CRISPR and ORF expression screens, we systematically examined the ability of cancer drivers to mediate resistance of NMC to BETis and uncovered six general classes/pathways mediating resistance. Among these, we showed that RRAS2 attenuated the effect of JQ1 in part by sustaining ERK pathway function during BRD4 inhibition. Furthermore, overexpression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), mediated BETi resistance in NMC cells through restoration of the E2F and MYC gene expression program. Finally, we found that expression of cyclin D1 or an oncogenic cyclin D3 mutant or RB1 loss protected NMC cells from BETi-induced cell cycle arrest. Consistent with these findings, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors showed synergistic effects with BETis on NMC in vitro as well as in vivo, thereby establishing a potential two-drug therapy for NMC."	"Essentials RAS proteins are expressed in platelets but their functions are largely uncharacterized. TC21/RRas2 is required for glycoprotein VI-induced platelet responses and for thrombus stability in vivo. TC21 regulates platelet aggregation by control of α<sub>IIb</sub> β<sub>3</sub> integrin activation, via crosstalk with Rap1b. This is the first indication of functional importance of a proto-oncogenic RAS protein in platelets.Background Many RAS family small GTPases are expressed in platelets, including RAC, RHOA, RAP, and HRAS/NRAS/RRAS1, but most of their signaling and cellular functions remain poorly understood. Like RRAS1, TC21/RRAS2 reverses HRAS-induced suppression of integrin activation in CHO cells. However, a role for TC21 in platelets has not been explored. Objectives To determine TC21 expression in platelets, TC21 activation in response to platelet agonists, and roles of TC21 in platelet function in in vitro and in vivo thrombosis. Results We demonstrate that TC21 is expressed in human and murine platelets, and is activated in response to agonists for the glycoprotein (GP) VI-FcRγ immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing collagen receptor, in an Src-dependent manner. GPVI-induced platelet aggregation, integrin α<sub>II</sub><sub>b</sub> β<sub>3</sub> activation, and α-granule and dense granule secretion, as well as phosphorylation of Syk, phospholipase Cγ2, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, were inhibited in TC21-deficient platelets ex vivo. In contrast, these responses were normal in TC21-deficient platelets following stimulation with P2Y, protease-activated receptor 4 and C-type lectin receptor 2 receptor agonists, indicating that the function of TC21 in platelets is GPVI-FcRγ-ITAM-specific. TC21 was required for GPVI-induced activation of Rap1b. TC21-deficient mice did not show a significant delay in injury-induced thrombosis as compared with wild-type controls; however, thrombi were unstable. Hemostatic responses showed similar effects. Conclusions TC21 is essential for GPVI-FcRγ-mediated platelet activation and for thrombus stability in vivo via control of Rap1b and integrins."	"Upon antigen recognition within peripheral lymphoid organs, B cells interact with T cells and other immune cells to transiently form morphological structures called germinal centers (GCs), which are required for B cell clonal expansion, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation. This process, known as the GC response, is an energetically demanding process that requires the metabolic reprogramming of B cells. We showed that the Ras-related guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) R-Ras2 (also known as TC21) plays an essential, nonredundant, and B cell-intrinsic role in the GC response. Both the conversion of B cells into GC B cells and their expansion were impaired in mice lacking R-Ras2, but not in those lacking a highly related R-Ras subfamily member or both the classic H-Ras and N-Ras GTPases. In the absence of R-Ras2, activated B cells did not exhibit increased oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic glycolysis. We showed that R-Ras2 was an effector of both the B cell receptor (BCR) and CD40 and that, in its absence, B cells exhibited impaired activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway, reduced mitochondrial DNA replication, and decreased expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism. Because most human B cell lymphomas originate from GC B cells or B cells that have undergone the GC response, our data suggest that R-Ras2 may also regulate metabolism in B cell malignancies."	"Rapid and effective neural transmission of information requires correct axonal myelination. Modifications in myelination alter axonal capacity to transmit electric impulses and enable pathological conditions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLs) myelinate axons, a complex process involving various cellular interactions. However, we know little about the mechanisms that orchestrate correct myelination. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Using female and male mutant mice to delete these proteins, we found that activation of the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways was weaker in mice lacking one or both of these GTPases, suggesting that both proteins coordinate the activity of these two pathways. Loss of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 diminishes the number of OLs in major myelinated CNS tracts and increases the proportion of immature OLs. In <i>R-Ras1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>R-Ras2</i><sup>-/-</sup>-null mice, OLs show aberrant morphologies and fail to differentiate correctly into myelin-forming phenotypes. The smaller OL population and abnormal OL maturation induce severe hypomyelination, with shorter nodes of Ranvier in <i>R-Ras1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and/or <i>R-Ras2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. These defects explain the slower conduction velocity of myelinated axons that we observed in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Together, these results suggest that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are upstream elements that regulate the survival and differentiation of progenitors into OLs through the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways for proper myelination.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we show that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 play essential roles in regulating myelination <i>in vivo</i> and control fundamental aspects of oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and differentiation through synergistic activation of PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK signaling. Mice lacking R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 show a diminished OL population with a higher proportion of immature OLs, explaining the observed hypomyelination in main CNS tracts. <i>In vivo</i> electrophysiology recordings demonstrate a slower conduction velocity of nerve impulses in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Therefore, R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for proper axonal myelination and accurate neural transmission."	"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), glioma oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), and truncated GLI1 (tGLI1) are oncogenic transcription factors playing important roles in breast cancer. tGLI1 is a gain-of-function GLI1 isoform. Whether STAT3 physically and/or functionally interacts with GLI1/tGLI1 has not been explored. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed 47 node-positive breast cancer specimens using immunohistochemical staining and found that phosphorylated-STAT3 (Y705), GLI1, and tGLI1 are co-overexpressed in the majority of triple-negative breast carcinomas (64%) and HER2-enriched (68%) breast carcinomas, and in lymph node metastases (65%). Using gene set enrichment analysis, we analyzed 710 breast tumors and found that STAT3 activation and GLI1/tGLI1 activation signatures are co-enriched in triple-negative subtypes of breast cancers and HER2-enriched subtypes of breast cancers, but not in luminal subtypes of breast cancers. Patients with high levels of STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1 co-activation in their breast tumors had worse metastasis-free survival compared to those with low levels. Since these proteins co-overexpress in breast tumors, we examined whether they form complexes and observed that STAT3 interacted with both GLI1 and tGLI1. We further found that the STAT3-GLI1 and STAT3-tGLI1 complexes bind to both consensus GLI1-binding and STAT3-binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and that the co-overexpression markedly activated a promoter controlled by GLI1-binding sites. To identify genes that can be directly co-activated by STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1, we analyzed three ChIP-seq datasets and identified 34 potential target genes. Following validations using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and survival analysis, we identified three genes as novel transcriptional targets of STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1, R-Ras2, Cep70, and UPF3A. Finally, we observed that co-overexpression of STAT3 with GLI1/tGLI1 promoted the ability of breast cancer cells to form mammospheres and that STAT3 only cooperates with tGLI1 in immortalized mammary epithelial cells. In summary, our study identified novel physical and functional cooperation between two families of oncogenic transcription factors, and the interaction contributes to aggressiveness of breast cancer cells and poor prognosis of triple-negative breast cancers and HER2-enriched breast cancers."	"Cellular senescence has been viewed as a tumor suppression mechanism and also as a contributor to individual aging. Widespread shortening of 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by alternative polyadenylation (APA) has recently been discovered in cancer cells. However, the role of APA in the process of cellular senescence remains elusive. Here, we found that hundreds of genes in senescent cells tended to use distal poly(A) (pA) sites, leading to a global lengthening of 3' UTRs and reduced gene expression. Genes that harbor longer 3' UTRs in senescent cells were enriched in senescence-related pathways. <i>Rras2</i>, a member of the Ras superfamily that participates in multiple signal transduction pathways, preferred longer 3' UTR usage and exhibited decreased expression in senescent cells. Depletion of <i>Rras2</i> promoted senescence, while rescue of <i>Rras2</i> reversed senescence-associated phenotypes. Mechanistically, splicing factor TRA2B bound to a core &quot;AGAA&quot; motif located in the alternative 3' UTR of <i>Rras2</i>, thereby reducing the RRAS2 protein level and causing senescence. Both proximal and distal poly(A) signals showed strong sequence conservation, highlighting the vital role of APA regulation during evolution. Our results revealed APA as a novel mechanism in regulating cellular senescence."	"Alternative splicing provides a major mechanism to generate protein diversity. Increasing evidence suggests a link of dysregulation of splicing associated with cancer. Genome-wide alternative splicing profiling in lung cancer remains largely unstudied. We generated alternative splicing profiles in 491 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 471 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients in TCGA using RNA-seq data, prognostic models and splicing networks were built by integrated bioinformatics analysis. A total of 3691 and 2403 alternative splicing events were significantly associated with patient survival in LUAD and LUSC, respectively, including EGFR, CD44, PIK3C3, RRAS2, MAPKAP1 and FGFR2. The area under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristic curve for prognostic predictor in NSCLC was 0.817 at 2000 days of overall survival which were also over 0.8 in LUAD and LUSC, separately. Interestingly, splicing correlation networks uncovered opposite roles of splicing factors in LUAD and LUSC. We created prognostic predictors based on alternative splicing events with high performances for risk stratification in NSCLC patients and uncovered interesting splicing networks in LUAD and LUSC which could be underlying mechanisms."	"RAS effectors specifically interact with the GTP-bound form of RAS in response to extracellular signals and link them to downstream signaling pathways. The molecular nature of effector interaction by RAS is well-studied but yet still incompletely understood in a comprehensive and systematic way. Here, structure-function relationships in the interaction between different RAS proteins and various effectors were investigated in detail by combining our in vitro data with in silico data. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined for the binding of HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, RRAS1 and RRAS2 to both the RAS binding (RB) domain of CRAF and PI3Kα, and the RAS association (RA) domain of RASSF5, RALGDS and PLCε, respectively, using fluorescence polarization. An interaction matrix, constructed on the basis of available crystal structures, allowed identification of hotspots as critical determinants for RAS-effector interaction. New insights provided by this study are the dissection of the identified hotspots in five distinct regions (R1 to R5) in spite of high sequence variability not only between, but also within, RB/RA domain-containing effectors proteins. Finally, we propose that intermolecular β-sheet interaction in R1 is a central recognition region while R3 may determine specific contacts of RAS versus RRAS isoforms with effectors."	"The Ras-related (R-Ras) isoforms TC21, R-Ras and M-Ras are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. R-Ras family proteins are frequently overexpressed in human cancers, and expression of activated mutants of these GTPases is sufficient to induce cell transformation. Unlike Ras, few activating mutations of R-Ras proteins have been reported in human cancer, and very little is known about the regulation of their activity. In this study, we report that TC21 and R-Ras are phosphorylated on a conserved serine, Ser186 and Ser201, respectively, in intact cells. This residue is located in the C-terminal hypervariable region of the proteins and is not conserved in M-Ras. We show that the MAP kinases ERK1/2 phosphorylate TC21 and R-Ras on this C-terminal serine residue both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of R-Ras proteins does not affect their subcellular localization or stability but rather stimulates their activation. Phosphorylation-defective mutants of R-Ras and TC21 are compromised in their ability to promote cancer cell adhesion and migration/invasion, respectively. Importantly, we show that phosphorylation of TC21 and R-Ras potentiates their tumorigenic activity in immunodeficient mice. Our results identify a novel regulatory mechanism of the small GTPases TC21 and R-Ras that controls their oncogenic potential."	"Influences of adenosine 2A receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) activity on the cardiac transcriptome and genesis of endotoxemic myocarditis are unclear. We applied transcriptomic profiling (39 K Affymetrix arrays) to identify A<sub>2A</sub>R-sensitive molecules, revealed by receptor knockout (KO), in healthy and endotoxemic hearts. Baseline cardiac function was unaltered and only 37 A<sub>2A</sub>R-sensitive genes modified by A<sub>2A</sub>R KO (≥1.2-fold change, &lt;5 % FDR); the five most induced are Mtr, Ppbp, Chac1, Ctsk and Cnpy2 and the five most repressed are Hp, Yipf4, Acta1, Cidec and Map3k2. Few canonical paths were impacted, with altered Gnb1, Prkar2b, Pde3b and Map3k2 (among others) implicating modified G protein/cAMP/PKA and cGMP/NOS signalling. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 mg/kg) challenge for 24 h modified &gt;4100 transcripts in wild-type (WT) myocardium (≥1.5-fold change, FDR &lt; 1 %); the most induced are Lcn2 (+590); Saa3 (+516); Serpina3n (+122); Cxcl9 (+101) and Cxcl1 (+89) and the most repressed are Car3 (-38); Adipoq (-17); Atgrl1/Aplnr (-14); H19 (-11) and Itga8 (-8). Canonical responses centred on inflammation, immunity, cell death and remodelling, with pronounced amplification of toll-like receptor (TLR) and underlying JAK-STAT, NFκB and MAPK pathways, and a 'cardio-depressant' profile encompassing suppressed ß-adrenergic, PKA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, electromechanical and mitochondrial function (and major shifts in transcripts impacting function/injury including Lcn2, S100a8/S100a9, Icam1/Vcam and Nox2 induction, and Adipoq, Igf1 and Aplnr repression). Endotoxemic responses were selectively modified by A<sub>2A</sub>R KO, supporting inflammatory suppression via A<sub>2A</sub>R sensitive shifts in regulators of NFκB and JAK-STAT signalling (IκBζ, IκBα, STAT1, CDKN1a and RRAS2) without impacting the cardio-depressant gene profile. Data indicate A<sub>2A</sub>Rs exert minor effects in un-stressed myocardium and selectively suppress NFκB and JAK-STAT signalling and cardiac injury without influencing cardiac depression in endotoxemia."	"CNS germinomas represent a unique germ cell tumor entity characterized by undifferentiated tumor cells and a high response rate to current treatment protocols. Limited information is available on their underlying genomic, epigenetic and biological alterations. We performed a genome-wide analysis of genomic copy number alterations in 49 CNS germinomas by molecular inversion profiling. In addition, CpG dinucleotide methylation was studied by immunohistochemistry for methylated cytosine residues. Mutational analysis was performed by resequencing of candidate genes including KIT and RAS family members. Ras/Erk and Akt pathway activation was analyzed by immunostaining with antibodies against phospho-Erk, phosho-Akt, phospho-mTOR and phospho-S6. All germinomas coexpressed Oct4 and Kit but showed an extensive global DNA demethylation compared to other tumors and normal tissues. Molecular inversion profiling showed predominant genomic instability in all tumors with a high frequency of regional gains and losses including high level gene amplifications. Activating mutations of KIT exons 11, 13, and 17 as well as a case with genomic KIT amplification and activating mutations or amplifications of RAS gene family members including KRAS, NRAS and RRAS2 indicated mutational activation of crucial signaling pathways. Co-activation of Ras/Erk and Akt pathways was present in 83% of germinomas. These data suggest that CNS germinoma cells display a demethylated nuclear DNA similar to primordial germ cells in early development. This finding has a striking coincidence with extensive genomic instability. In addition, mutational activation of Kit-, Ras/Raf/Erk- and Akt- pathways indicate the biological importance of these pathways and their components as potential targets for therapy."	NA
"SOS1"	"Noonan syndrome"	"WHO characterizes novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic. Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels, T cell proportion and related gene expression occurring in COVID-19 patients on admission and after intial treatment.11 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimen were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokines, CyTOF and microfluidic qPCR for gene expression were conducted.5 mild and 6 severe patients were included. Cough and fever were the top symptoms in the 11 COVID-2019 cases. The elder age, more neutrophils numbers and higher C-reactive protein level were found in severe cases. IL-10 level was significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. The decreased T cell proportions were observed in COVID-19 patients especially in severe cases, and all elevated to normal in mild patiens after initial treatment but only CD4+T cells return to normal in severe cases. The number of DEGs increased with the disease progress, and decreased after initial treatment. All down-regulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved in Th17 cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and T cell activation. After initial treatmen in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission.Our findings show a decreased T cell proportion with down-regulated gene expression related to T cell activation and differentiation were occurred in COVID-19 severe patients, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 ."	"K+/Na+ homeostasis is the primary core response for plant to tolerate to salinity. Halophytes evolve novel regulatory mechanisms to maintain the suitable K+/Na+ ratio during long-term adaptation. The wild halophyte Hordeum brevisubulatum can adopt efficient strategies up to the synergistic levels of K+ and Na+ content under high salt stress. However, little is known about its molecular mechanism. Our previous study indicated HbCIPK2 contributed to prevention of Na+ accumulation and K+ reduction. Here, we further identified the HbCIPK2-interacted proteins including upstream Ca2+ sensors, HbCBL1, HbCBL4 and HbCBL10, and downstream phosphorylated targets, voltage-gate K+ channel HbVGKC1 and SOS1-like transporter HbSOS1L. HbCBL1 combined with HbCIPK2 could evidently activate HbVGKC1 to absorb K+, while the HbCBL4/10-HbCIPK2 complex modulated HbSOS1L to exclude Na+. This discovery suggested the crosstalk between the sodium-response and the potassium-uptake signaling pathways indeed existed for HbCIPK2 as the signal hub, and paved the way for understanding the novel mechanism of K+/Na+ homeostasis evolved in the halophytic grass."	"The study is aimed to assess the morphological, physiological and molecular responses of seven Saccharum spontaneum clones, for salinity stress. These clones (IND-07-1462, IND-07-1465, IND-07-1470, IND-07-1471, IND 16-1761, IND 16-1762, and IND 16-1763) were subjected to salinity stress at two different concentrations of electrical conductivity 6ds/m and 8ds/m after 60 days of planting. All seven genotypes showed a decrease in relative water content and nitrate reductase activity with increase in severity of salt stress. The effect was more pronounced in IND-07-1471, while IND-16-1762 exhibited only a minimum drop. Similarly we observed an increase in proline content and lipid peroxidation activity for the genotype IND-07-1471, while IND-16-1762 showed minimum increase. Molecular profiling of genes/transcription factors like Salt Overly Sensitive, Responsive to Abscissic acid, Dirigent, Myeloblastosis, ethylene responsive factor associated with salinity stress tolerance showed 19, 18, 17, 10, 9 fold increased expression at 8 ds/m of salinity stress respectively in IND-16-1762 showed. Based on the evidences obtained from expression profiling we have cloned the conserved regions of RAB and SOS1 genes. The domain of SOS and RAB was identified as a regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases which is involved in signaling pathway. This article is protected by copyright.

Recent evidences demonstrate their roles in plant growth and defense responses.In present study, we show that the treatment of plant roots with N-3-oxo-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL), one molecule of AHLs family, resulted in enhanced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis and wheat. We found that the growth inhibition phenotype including root length, shoot length and fresh weight were significantly improved by 3OC6-HSL under salt stress condition. The physiological and biochemical analysis revealed that the contents of chlorophyll and proline were increased and the contents of MDA and Na<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios were decreased after 3OC6-HSL treatment in Arabidopsis and wheat under salt stress condition. Molecular analysis showed that 3OC6-HSL significantly upregulated the expression of salt-responsive genes including ABA-dependent osmotic stress responsive genes COR15a, RD22, ADH and P5CS1, ABA-independent gene ERD1, and ion-homeostasis regulation genes SOS1, SOS2 and SOS3 in Arabidopsis under salt stress condition.These results indicated that 3OC6-HSL enhanced plant salt tolerance and ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signal pathways and SOS signaling might be involved in the induction of salt resistance by 3OC6-HSL in plants. Our data provide a new insight into the plant-microbe inter-communication."	"Salt stress is one of the most serious threats in plants, reducing crop yield and production. The salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway in plants is a salt-responsive pathway that acts as a janitor of the cell to sweep out Na<sup>+</sup> ions. Transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of expression and/or repression of genes. The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) TF is a large family of TFs regulating various cellular processes in plants. In the current study, we investigated the role of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i><i>bZIP62</i> TF in the regulation of SOS signaling pathway by measuring the transcript accumulation of its key genes such as <i>SOS1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i>, in both wild-type (WT) and <i>atbzip62</i> knock-out (KO) mutants under salinity stress. We further observed the activation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems in the wild-type, <i>atbzip62, atcat2</i> (lacking catalase activity), and <i>atnced3</i> (lacking 9-<i>cis</i>-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase involved in the ABA pathway) KO mutants. Our findings revealed that <i>atbzip62</i> plants exhibited an enhanced salt-sensitive phenotypic response similar to <i>atnced3</i> and <i>atcat2</i> compared to WT, 10 days after 150 mM NaCl treatment. Interestingly, the transcriptional levels of <i>SOS1</i>, <i>SOS2</i>, and <i>SOS3</i> increased significantly over time in the <i>atbzip62</i> upon NaCl application, while they were downregulated in the wild type. We also measured chlorophyll a and b, pheophytin a and b, total pheophytin, and total carotenoids. We observed that the <i>atbzip62</i> exhibited an increase in chlorophyll and total carotenoid contents, as well as proline contents, while it exhibited a non-significant increase in catalase activity. Our results suggest that <i>AtbZIP62</i> negatively regulates the transcriptional events of <i>SOS</i> pathway genes, <i>AtbZIP18</i> and <i>AtbZIP69</i> while modulating the antioxidant response to salt tolerance in <i>Arabidopsis</i>."	"Noonan syndrome is a common genetic disease characterized by peculiar face, short stature, congenital heart disease and thoracic deformity. The pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome is mainly related to abnormal Ras-MAPK signal pathway which involves more than 16 genes including (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1)] and KRAS. At present, there is a lack of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of Noonan syndrome in China. This guideline has summarized the clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment for Noonan syndrome, with an aim to improve the diagnostic level and clinical management of patients with this syndrome."	"Essential elements taken up from the soil and distributed throughout the whole plant play diverse roles in different tissues. Cations and anions contribute to maintenance of intracellular osmolarity and the formation of membrane potential, while nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate are incorporated into amino acids and other organic compounds. In contrast to these ion species, calcium concentrations are usually kept low in the cytosol and calcium displays unique behavior as a cytosolic signaling molecule. Various environmental stresses stimulate increases in the cytosolic calcium concentration, leading to activation of calcium-regulated protein kinases and downstream signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize the stress responsive regulation of nutrient uptake and balancing by two types of calcium-regulated phosphorylation systems: CPK and CBL-CIPK. CPK is a family of protein kinases activated by calcium. CBL is a group of calcium sensor proteins that interact with CIPK kinases, which phosphorylate their downstream targets. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, quite a few ion transport systems are regulated by CPKs or CBL-CIPK complexes, including channels/transporters that mediate transport of potassium (KAT1, KAT2, GORK, AKT1, AKT2, HAK5, SPIK), sodium (SOS1), ammonium (AMT1;1, AMT1;2), nitrate and chloride (SLAC1, SLAH2, SLAH3, NRT1.1, NRT2.4, NRT2.5), and proton (AHA2, V-ATPase). CPKs and CBL-CIPKs also play a role in C/N nutrient response and in acquisition of magnesium and iron. This functional regulation by calcium-dependent phosphorylation systems ensures the growth of plants and enables them to acquire tolerance against various environmental stresses. Calcium serves as the key factor for the regulation of membrane transport systems."	"Transforming anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements are well known as a unique subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutations other than EGFR. Currently, crizotinib is the standard first-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC.With advances in detection methods, more and more uncommon ALK fusion partners have been identified. Herein we present a novel SOS1-ALK fusion and the efficacy of crizotinib in an advanced NSCLC patient harboring this type of fusion.A 52-year-old Chinese man had left upper lobe primary NSCLC and synchronous multiple lung metastases (cT2N3M1, stage IV). The ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology of palpable left supraclavicular lymph nodes and the results of immunohistochemistry staining supported the diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Using a next-generation sequencing assay (NGS), we showed that the tumor had a SOS1-ALK fusion which the breakpoints was (S2, A20) rather than other actionable mutations. Therefore, the patient received first-line crizotinib and experienced a remarkable tumor response and has tolerated crizotinib well until this writing.Considering this rare SOS1-ALK fusion and remarkable response to an ALK-inhibitor, it is important to be aware of the presence of SOS1-ALK fusions in patients with advanced NSCLC to better guide targeted therapy. Precision methods, such as NGS for oncogenic alteration detection, should also be encouraged in clinical practice."	"SHP2 mediates RAS activation downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cancer cell lines dependent on RTKs are in general dependent on SHP2. Profiling of the allosteric SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 across cancer cell lines harboring various RTK dependencies reveals that FGFR-dependent cells are often insensitive to SHP099 when compared to EGFR-dependent cells. We find that FGFR-driven cells depend on SHP2 but exhibit resistance to SHP2 inhibitors <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Treatment of such models with SHP2 inhibitors results in an initial decrease in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK) levels, however p-ERK levels rapidly rebound within two hours. This p-ERK rebound is blocked by FGFR inhibitors or high doses of SHP2 inhibitors. Mechanistically, compared with EGFR-driven cells, FGFR-driven cells tend to express high levels of RTK negative regulators such as the SPRY family proteins, which are rapidly downregulated upon ERK inhibition. Moreover, over-expression of SPRY4 in FGFR-driven cells prevents MAPK pathway reactivation and sensitizes them to SHP2 inhibitors. We also identified two novel combination approaches to enhance the efficacy of SHP2 inhibitors, either with a distinct site 2 allosteric SHP2 inhibitor or with a RAS-SOS1 interaction inhibitor. Our findings suggest the rapid FGFR feedback activation following initial pathway inhibition by SHP2 inhibitors may promote the open conformation of SHP2 and lead to resistance to SHP2 inhibitors. These findings may assist to refine patient selection and predict resistance mechanisms in the clinical development of SHP2 inhibitors and to suggest strategies for discovering SHP2 inhibitors that are more effective against upstream feedback activation."	"We report the case of a 14-year-old girl that was referred to the maxillo facial surgery unit at age 11 years because she exhibited swelling in the right side of her maxilla and right mandible. After a conservative surgery, she started with interferon alpha-2a to avoid recurrence. She has remained in treatment with successful results during her follow up. Considerable reduction of both maxilla and mandible lesions and bone fill have been documented. In addition, her clinical history and phenotype were suggestive of Noonan syndrome. She has short stature, broad and short neck; hypertelorism (increased distance between the eyes); downslanting palpebral fissures; sparse eyebrows and eyelashes; posteriorly rotated ears with fleshy lobes; follicular keratosis over the face, and developmental delay. Her karyotype was 46, XX. Molecular analysis of RAS/MAPK pathway genes showed a SOS1 amino acid substitution of arginine to lysine at position 552 (p.R552K). This case presents the infrequent condition of Noonan syndrome with multiple giant cell lesions (NS/MGCL) that would be the first patient as far as we know treated with surgery and interferon alpha-2a for her giant cell lesions."	"As a member of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase substrate 8 (EPS8) family, the role of EPS8 like 3 protein (EPS8L3) has not been well studied in malignancies. However, EPS8 has been reported to be associated with prognosis and functions in several kinds of cancers. Hence, whether EPS8L3 plays similar roles in the tumorigenesis of human cancers, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is still needed to be further explored. In this study, we revealed that EPS8L3 was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, and was associated with a poor clinical prognosis. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments showed that EPS8L3 could promote the proliferative ability by downregulating p21/p27 expression, and promote the migratory and invasive abilities by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EPS8L3 could affect the activation of the EGFR-ERK pathway by modulating EGFR dimerization and internalization, which may not depend on the formation of EPS8L3-SOS1-ABI1 complex. Taken together, our study showed that EPS8L3 plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC, and it might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC."	"Aberrant expression of ubiquitin-specific peptide 22 (USP22) has been detected in various cancers. This study aimed to investigate the role of USP22 and the underlying mechanism in human gastric cancer.The expression pattern of USP22 in human gastric cancer was detected in a tissue microarray containing 88 pairs of gastric cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue samples from patients with primary gastric cancer using immunohistochemical staining. The correlation of USP22 expression with clinical characteristics of patients, as well as their prognostic values in the overall survival of patients, were evaluated. USP22-overexpressing SGC7901 and USP22-silencing AGS cells were used to explore the role of USP22 in gastric cancer cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to identify differentially expressed genes induced by USP22 overexpression. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the activation of RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in USP22-overexpressing SGC7901 cells and xenograft tumor tissues. Knockdown of RAS activator son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) was performed to investigate the role of SOS1 in USP22-regulated gastric cancer cell behavior and RAS signaling both in vitro and in vivo.USP22 protein expression was significantly increased in human gastric cancer tissues, compared with adjacent normal tissues, and was positively correlated with local tumor stage. Gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that USP22 promoted gastric cancer cell growth and cell cycle transition while suppressing apoptosis in vitro. Consistent results were observed in a xenograft mouse model. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that the overexpression of USP22 induced the upregulation of RAS activator son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) in SGC7901 cells. Western blot analysis showed that USP22 overexpression also induced activation of the RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways in SGC7901 cells and xenograft tumor tissues. Furthermore, SOS1 silencing could reverse the effects of USP22 on gastric cancer cell behavior and RAS signaling both in vitro and in vivo.Our results suggest that USP22 acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer in a SOS1-dependent manner, identifying the USP22/SOS1/RAS axis as a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer."	"The WRKY transcription factor family is involved in responding to biotic and abiotic stresses. Its members contain a typical WRKY domain and can regulate plant physiological responses by binding to W-boxes in the promoter regions of downstream target genes. We identified the sweet sorghum SbWRKY50 (Sb09g005700) gene, which encodes a typical class II of the WRKY family protein that localizes to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. The expression of SbWRKY50 in sweet sorghum was reduced by salt stress, and its ectopic expression reduced the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Compared with the wild type, the germination rate, root length, biomass and potassium ion content of SbWRKY50 over-expression plants decreased significantly under salt-stress conditions, while the hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion and sodium ion contents increased. Real-time PCR results showed that the expression levels of AtSOS1, AtHKT1 and genes related to osmotic and oxidative stresses in over-expression strains decreased under salt-stress conditions. Luciferase complementation imaging and yeast one-hybrid assays confirmed that SbWRKY50 could directly bind to the upstream promoter of the SOS1 gene in A. thaliana. However, in sweet sorghum, SbWRKY50 could directly bind to the upstream promoters of SOS1 and HKT1. These results suggest that the new WRKY transcription factor SbWRKY50 participates in plant salt response by controlling ion homeostasis. However, the regulatory mechanisms are different in sweet sorghum and Arabidopsis, which may explain their different salt tolerance levels. The data provide information that can be applied to genetically modifying salt tolerance in different crop varieties."	"This study aimed to assess gene expression alterations related to T lymphocytes function and explore their potential association with hypoxemia among septic patients.This is a retrospective cohort clinical study with laboratory investigations. We studied patients enrolled in sepsis biological specimen bank from Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, fulfilling consensus criteria for sepsis without any documented immune comorbidity admitted in ICU within 48 h after onset with whole blood samples drawn within 24 h of admission. Whole genome expression by microarray assay (Human LncRNA Microarray V4.0) was compared in hypoxemia cohort versus without. Differentially expressed (DE) genes with &gt;1 log<sub>2</sub>[fold change (FC)] and false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.20 that enriched in T cell related biological process entered the adjusted analysis to identify the candidate genes. The correlation analysis within candidate genes or with clinical parameters were performed. We assessed candidate expression <i>ex vivo</i> in co-culture system with RAW246.7 cells and validated genes identified in prior studies of sepsis-ARDS/hypoxemia within our present study.Septic patients (n=9) with hypoxemic phenotype held higher illness severity, serum lactate and creatine, and incidence of lymphopenia compared with non-hypoxemic group (n=6). Several gene signatures related to apoptosis, inhibitory receptors, T cell immunoreceptor, transcriptions factors, toll-like receptors and cytokine and effector molecules were upregulated in hypoxemic group. Candidate genes were identified after adjustment for age, sex and presence of lymphopenia with significantly negative correlations with partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in an arterial blood (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and fraction of inspiration O<sub>2</sub> (FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio, among which NLRP3, SOS1, ELF1 and STAT3 held an increasing expression in <i>ex vivo</i> validation while the others, PSMA5, CLEC4D, CD300A, PRKD2 and PSMA2 showed the opposite alteration from those <i>in vivo</i>.Higher illness severity and incidence of lymphopenia was observed following hypoxemia in sepsis and T cell-related gene signatures were associated with hypoxemia during sepsis."	"This study aims to investigate the value of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and whole exome sequencing (WES) in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (defined as NT above the 95th centile for the crown-rump length). A total of 374 singleton pregnancies with gestational ages ranging from 11 to 13 + 6 weeks were investigated. Ultrasound displayed increased NT and no detectable structural malformations in these fetuses. Pregnancies were divided into 4 groups according to the NT values: 95th centile-3.4 mm (114 cases); 3.5-4.4 mm (150 cases); 4.5-5.4 mm (55 cases); and ≥5.5 mm (55 cases). The possible chromosomal anomalies were all analyzed by CMA first. Furthermore, 24 cases with increased NT but negative CMA results were investigated by WES, and the outcomes were followed up. Among all the 374 cases, causative genetic defects were detected in 100/374 (26.7%) of the cases along with 9 variants of unknown significance (VOUS) by CMA. CMA testing yielded 30 pathogenic variants (30/55), accounting for a detection rate of 54.5%, and 1 VOUS in the group of NT ≥5.5 mm, indicating the highest detection rate in the 4 groups. The 24 cases of the CMA negative sub-cohort with WES analysis further yielded 2 VOUS and 3 likely pathogenic variants, including 2 dominant de novo mutations in SOS1 and ECE1 and 1 recessive inherited compound heterozygous mutation in PIGN, which are associated with cardiac defects. All 3 cases opted for termination of pregnancy (TOP). In addition, 2 cases with increased NT were negative by both CMA and WES analysis, and fetal demise occurred. In conclusion, for the investigation of fetuses with increased NT exome sequencing is suggested to be considered in cases with negative CMA findings. However, appropriate genetic counseling should be given to optimizing its utilization in prenatal diagnosis."	"Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is one of the developmental disorders caused by a dysregulation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. RASopathies share overlapping clinical features, making the diagnosis challenging, especially in the newborn period. The majority of CFC syndrome cases arise by a mutation in the <i>BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2</i>, or (rarely) <i>KRAS</i> genes. Germline <i>KRAS</i> mutations are identified in a minority of CFC and Noonan syndrome cases. Here, we describe a patient with a <i>KRAS</i> mutation presenting with a CFC syndrome phenotype. The female patient was referred for genetic testing because of congenital exophthalmos. Her facial appearance is distinctive with a coarse face, exophthalmos, ptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, deep philtrum, downturned corners of the mouth, and a short neck. She suffered from feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and developmental delay. The sequencing of the genes involved in the MAPK pathway (<i>PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1, SHOC2, CBL, and SPRED1</i>) identified a heterozygous de novo NM_004985.4:c.173C&gt;T (p.Thr58Ile) in the <i>KRAS</i> gene. Germline <i>KRAS</i> mutations have been identified in approximately 2% of the reported NS cases and less than 5% of the reported CFC syndrome cases. Because CFC and Noonan syndrome share clinical overlapping features, the phenotype caused by <i>KRAS</i> mutations is often difficult to assign to one of the 2 entities. The mutation that we detected in our patient was previously reported in a patient with an Noonan syndrome phenotype. However, our patient predominantly exhibits CFC clinical features. In our case, coarse facial appearance and severe developmental delay help discriminate CFC from Noonan syndrome. Thus, patient follow-up, especially for delayed motor milestones suspected from RASopathies, is important for the discrimination of overlapping conditions as in the abovementioned syndromes."	"High salt stress caused by ionic and osmotic stressors eventually results in the suppression of plant growth and a reduction in crop productivity. In our previous reports, we isolated the endophytic bacterium <i>Bacillus oryzicola</i> YC7007 from the rhizosphere of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.), which promoted plant growth and development and suppressed bacterial disease in rice by inducing systemic resistance and antibiotic production. In this study, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seedlings under salt stress that were bacterized with YC7007 displayed an increase in the number of lateral roots and greater fresh weight relative to that of the control seedlings. The chlorophyll content of the bacterized seedlings was increased when compared with that of untreated seedlings. The accumulation of salt-induced malondialdehyde and Na<sup>+</sup> in seedlings was inhibited by their co-cultivation with YC7007. The expression of stress-related genes in the shoots and roots of seedlings was induced by YC7007 inoculation under salt stress conditions. Interestingly, YC7007-mediated salt tolerance requires SOS1, a plasma membrane-localized Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, given that plant growth in <i>sos2-1</i> and <i>sos3-1</i> mutants was promoted under salt-stress conditions, whereas that of <i>sos1-1</i> mutants was not. In addition, inoculation with YC7007 in upland-crops, such as radish and cabbage, increased the number of lateral roots and the fresh weight of seedlings under salt-stress conditions. Our results suggest that <i>B. oryzicola</i> YC7007 enhanced plant tolerance to salt stress via the SOS1-dependent salt signaling pathway, resulting in the normal growth of salt-stressed plants."	"Protein kinases are major regulatory components in almost all cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. By adding phosphate groups, protein kinases regulate the activity, localization, protein-protein interactions, and other features of their target proteins. It is known that protein kinases are central components in plant responses to environmental stresses such as drought, high salinity, cold, and pathogen attack. However, only a few targets of these protein kinases have been identified. Moreover, how these protein kinases regulate downstream biological processes and mediate stress responses is still largely unknown. In this study, we introduce a strategy based on isotope-labeled in vitro phosphorylation reactions using in vivo phosphorylated peptides as substrate pools and apply this strategy to identify putative substrates of nine protein kinases that function in plant abiotic and biotic stress responses. As a result, we identified more than 5,000 putative target sites of osmotic stress-activated SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.6, abscisic acid-activated protein kinases SnRK2.6 and casein kinase 1-like 2 (CKL2), elicitor-activated protein kinase CDPK11 and MPK6, cold-activated protein kinase MPK6, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-activated protein kinase OXI1 and MPK6, and salt-induced protein kinase SOS1 and MPK6, as well as the low-potassium-activated protein kinase CIPK23. These results provide comprehensive information on the role of these protein kinases in the control of cellular activities and could be a valuable resource for further studies on the mechanisms underlying plant responses to environmental stresses."	"Grb2 is an adaptor protein that recruits Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Son of Sevenless 1 (SOS1), to the plasma membrane. SOS1 exchanges GDP by GTP, activating Ras. Grb2 consists of an SH2 domain flanked by N- and C-terminal SH3 domains (nSH3/cSH3). Grb2 nSH3/cSH3 domains have strong binding affinity for the SOS1 proline-rich (PR) domain that mediates the Grb2-SOS1 interaction. The nSH3/cSH3 domains have distinct preferred binding motifs: PxxPxR for nSH3 and PxxxRxxKP for cSH3 (x represents any natural amino acid). Several nSH3-binding motifs have been identified in the SOS1 PR domain but none specific for cSH3 binding. Even though both nSH3 and cSH3 exhibit the strongest binding to the SOS1 peptide PVPPPVPPRRRP, this mutually exclusive binding combined with other potential nSH3/cSH3 binding regions in SOS1 makes understanding the Grb2-SOS1 interaction challenging. To identify the SOS1-cSH3 binding sites, we selected seven potential binding segments in SOS1. The synthesized peptides were tested for their binding to nSH3/cSH3. Our NMR data reveal that the PKLPPKTYKREH peptide has strong binding affinity for cSH3, but very weak for nSH3. The binding specificity suggests that the most likely Grb2-SOS1 binding mode is through nSH3-PVPPPVPPRRRP and cSH3-PKLPPKTYKREH interactions, which is supported by replica-exchange simulations for the Grb2-SOS1 complex models. We propose that nSH3/cSH3 binding peptides, which effectively interrupt Grb2-SOS1 association, can serve as tumor suppressors. The Grb2-SOS1 mechanism outlined here offers new venues for future therapeutic strategies for upstream mutations in cancer, such as in EGFR."	"Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) toxicity is one of the major damages imposed on crops by saline-alkaline stress. Here we show that natural maize inbred lines display substantial variations in shoot Na<sup>+</sup> contents and saline-alkaline (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) tolerance, and reveal that ZmNSA1 (Na<sup>+</sup> Content under Saline-Alkaline Condition) confers shoot Na<sup>+</sup> variations under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> condition by a genome-wide association study. Lacking of ZmNSA1 promotes shoot Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis by increasing root Na<sup>+</sup> efflux. A naturally occurred 4-bp deletion decreases the translation efficiency of ZmNSA1 mRNA, thus promotes Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. We further show that, under saline-alkaline condition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to the EF-hand domain of ZmNSA1 then triggers its degradation via 26S proteasome, which in turn increases the transcripts levels of PM-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (MHA2 and MHA4), and consequently enhances SOS1 Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter-mediated root Na<sup>+</sup> efflux. Our studies reveal the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered saline-alkaline tolerance and provide an important gene target for breeding saline-alkaline tolerant maize varieties."
"ETHE1"	"Leigh syndrome"	"3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) has emerged as one of the significant sources of biologically active sulfur species in various mammalian cells. The current study was designed to investigate the functional role of 3-MST's catalytic activity in the murine colon cancer cell line CT26. The novel pharmacological 3-MST inhibitor HMPSNE was used to assess cancer cell proliferation, migration and bioenergetics in vitro. Methods included measurements of cell viability (MTT and LDH assays), cell proliferation and in vitro wound healing (IncuCyte) and cellular bioenergetics (Seahorse extracellular flux analysis). 3-MST expression was detected by Western blotting; H<sub>2</sub>S production was measured by the fluorescent dye AzMC. The results show that CT26 cells express 3-MST protein and mRNA, as well as several enzymes involved in H<sub>2</sub>S degradation (TST, ETHE1). Pharmacological inhibition of 3-MST concentration-dependently suppressed H<sub>2</sub>S production and, at 100 and 300 µM, attenuated CT26 proliferation and migration. HMPSNE exerted a bell-shaped effect on several cellular bioenergetic parameters related to oxidative phosphorylation, while other bioenergetic parameters were either unaffected or inhibited at the highest concentration of the inhibitor tested (300 µM). In contrast to 3-MST, the expression of CBS (another H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme which has been previously implicated in the regulation of various biological parameters in other tumor cells) was not detectable in CT26 cells and pharmacological inhibition of CBS exerted no significant effects on CT26 proliferation or bioenergetics. In summary, 3-MST catalytic activity significantly contributes to the regulation of cellular proliferation, migration and bioenergetics in CT26 murine colon cancer cells. The current studies identify 3-MST as the principal source of biologically active H<sub>2</sub>S in this cell line."	"Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 (ETHE1) and molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) deficiencies are hereditary disorders that affect the catabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. ETHE1 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene, while MoCo deficiency is due to mutations in one of three genes involved in MoCo biosynthesis (MOCS1, MOCS2 and GPHN). Patients with both disorders exhibit abnormalities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, among other biochemical findings. However, the pathophysiology of the defects has not been elucidated. To characterize cellular derangements, mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria communication, superoxide production and apoptosis were evaluated in fibroblasts from four patients with ETHE1 deficiency and one with MOCS1 deficiency. The effect of JP4-039, a promising mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, was also tested on cells. Our data show that mitochondrial respiration was decreased in all patient cell lines. ATP depletion and increased mitochondrial mass was identified in the same cells, while variable alterations in mitochondrial fusion and fission were seen. High superoxide levels were found in all cells and were decreased by treatment with JP4-039, while the respiratory chain activity was increased by this antioxidant in cells in which it was impaired. The content of VDAC1 and IP3R, proteins involved in ER-mitochondria communication, was decreased, while DDIT3, a marker of ER stress, and apoptosis were increased in all cell lines. These data demonstrate that previously unrecognized broad disturbances of cellular function are involved in the pathophysiology of ETHE1 and MOCS1 deficiencies, and that reduction of mitochondrial superoxide by JP4-039 is a promising strategy for adjuvant therapy of these disorders."	"Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy Protein 1 (<i>ETHE1</i>) is a sulfur dioxygenase that regulates cellular H<sub>2</sub>S levels. We previously demonstrated a significant increase of <i>ETHE1</i> expression in &quot;single-hit&quot; colon epithelial cells from crypts of patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Here, we report elevated levels of <i>ETHE1</i> expression and increased mitochondrial density occurring in-situ in phenotypically normal FAP colorectal mucosa. We also found that constitutive expression of <i>ETHE1</i> increased aerobic glycolysis (&quot;Warburg effect&quot;), oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial biogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, thereby depleting H<sub>2</sub>S which relieved the inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE), and increased adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels. This led to activation of the energy sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKp), Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. By contrast, shRNA silencing of <i>ETHE1</i> reduced PDE activity, AMPKp/SIRT1/PGC1α levels and mitochondrial biogenesis. Constitutive expression of <i>ETHE1</i> accelerated both CRC cell xenograft and orthotopic patient derived xenograft CRC cell growth <i>in vivo</i>. Overall, our data nominate elevated <i>ETHE1 expression levels</i> as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for the prevention of CRC tumorigenesis."	"Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is a rapidly progressive autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the ETHE1 gene that encodes the mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase. It is characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and regression, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, recurrent petechiae, chronic diarrhea, and orthostatic acrocyanosis. Laboratory findings include elevated serum levels of lactate and C4-C5 acylcarnitines, and elevated urinary excretion of ethylmalonic acid and C4-C6 acylglycines, notably isobutyrylglycine and 2-methylbutyrylglycine. These findings are attributed to deficiency of the mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase resulting in toxic accumulation of hydrogen sulfide metabolites in vascular endothelium and mucosal cells of the large intestine. Medical management has thus far been directed toward decreasing the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide metabolites using a combination of metronidazole and N-acetylcysteine. More recently, orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) has been reported as a new therapeutic option for EE. Here, we report two additional cases of EE who achieved psychomotor developmental improvement after 7- and 22-months following OLT. The second case serves as the longest developmental outcome follow-up reported, thus far, following OLT for EE. This report provides additional evidence to validate OLT as a promising therapeutic approach for what was considered to be a fatal disease."	"We report here the effects of hydrogen sulfide (sulfide), that accumulates in ETHE1 deficiency, in rat cerebellum. Sulfide impaired electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Sulfide also induced mitochondrial swelling, and decreased ΔΨm and calcium retention capacity in cerebellum mitochondria, which were prevented by cyclosporine A (CsA) plus ADP, and ruthenium red, suggesting mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) induction. Melatonin (MEL) and N-ethylmaleimide also prevented sulfide-induced alterations. Prevention of sulfide-induced decrease of ΔΨm and viability by CsA and MEL was further verified in cerebellum neurons. The data suggest that sulfide induces mPT pore opening via thiol modification and ROS generation."	"The mitochondrial enzyme ETHE1 is a persulfide dioxygenase essential for cellular sulfide detoxification, and its deficiency causes the severe and complex inherited metabolic disorder ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE). In spite of well-described clinical symptoms of the disease, detailed cellular and molecular characterization is still ambiguous. Cellular redox regulation has been described to be influenced in ETHE1 deficient cells, and to clarify this further we applied image cytometry and detected decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in cultivated EE patient fibroblast cells. Cell growth initiation of the EE patient cells was impaired, whereas cell cycle regulation was not. Furthermore, Seahorse metabolic analyzes revealed decreased extracellular acidification, i. e. decreased lactate formation from glycolysis, in the EE patient cells. TMT-based large-scale proteomics was subsequently performed to broadly elucidate cellular consequences of the ETHE1 deficiency. More than 130 proteins were differentially regulated, of which the majority were non-mitochondrial. The proteomics data revealed a link between ETHE1-deficiency and down-regulation of several ribosomal proteins and LIM domain proteins important for cellular maintenance, and up-regulation of cell surface glycoproteins. Furthermore, several proteins of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were perturbed including proteins influencing disulfide bond formation (e.g. protein disulfide isomerases and peroxiredoxin 4) and calcium-regulated proteins. The results indicate that decreased level of reduced GSH and alterations in proteins of ribosomes, ER and of cell adhesion lie behind the disrupted cell growth of the EE patient cells."	"ETHE1 is a member of a growing subclass of nonheme Fe enzymes that catalyzes transformations of sulfur-containing substrates without a cofactor. ETHE1 dioxygenates glutathione persulfide (GSSH) to glutathione (GSH) and sulfite in a reaction which is similar to that of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), but with monodentate (vs bidentate) substrate coordination and a 2-His/1-Asp (vs 3-His) ligand set. In this study, we demonstrate that GSS<sup>-</sup> binds directly to the iron active site, causing coordination unsaturation to prime the site for O<sub>2</sub> activation. Nitrosyl complexes without and with GSSH were generated and spectroscopically characterized as unreactive analogues for the invoked ferric superoxide intermediate. New spectral features from persulfide binding to the Fe<sup>III</sup> include the appearance of a low-energy Fe<sup>III</sup> ligand field transition, an energy shift of a NO<sup>-</sup> to Fe<sup>III</sup> CT transition, and two new GSS<sup>-</sup> to Fe<sup>III</sup> CT transitions. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations were used to simulate the experimental spectra to determine the persulfide orientation. Correlation of these spectral features with those of monodentate cysteine binding in isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) shows that the persulfide is a poorer donor but still results in an equivalent frontier molecular orbital for reactivity. The ETHE1 persulfide dioxygenation reaction coordinate was calculated, and while the initial steps are similar to the reaction coordinate of CDO, an additional hydrolysis step is required in ETHE1 to break the S-S bond. Unlike ETHE1 and CDO, which both oxygenate sulfur, IPNS oxidizes sulfur through an initial H atom abstraction. Thus, factors that determine oxygenase vs oxidase reactivity were evaluated. In general, sulfur oxygenation is thermodynamically favored and has a lower barrier for reactivity. However, in IPNS, second-sphere residues in the active site pocket constrain the substrate, raising the barrier for sulfur oxygenation relative to oxidation via H atom abstraction."	"Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene. ETHE1 is vital for the catabolism of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Patients with pathogenic mutations in ETHE1 have markedly increased thiosulfate, which is a reliable index of H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>S is thought to cause the characteristic metabolic derangement found in EE. Recently introduced treatment strategies in EE, such as combined use of metronidazole (MNZ) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), are aimed at lowering chronic H<sub>2</sub>S load. Experience with treatment strategies directed against acute episodes of metabolic decompensation (e.g., hemodialysis) is limited. Here we present an unusually mild, molecularly confirmed, case of EE in a 19-year-old male on chronic treatment with MNZ and NAC. During an acute episode of metabolic decompensation, we employed continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to regain metabolic control. On continuous treatment with NAC and MNZ during the months preceding the acute event, plasma thiosulfate levels ranged from 1.6 to 4 μg/mL (reference range up to 2 μg/mL) and had a mean value of 2.5 μg/mL. During the acute decompensation, thiosulfate levels were 6.7 μg/mL, with hyperlactatemia and perturbed organic acid, acylglycine, and acylcarnitine profiles. CRRT decreased thiosulfate within 24 h to 1.4 μg/mL. Following discontinuation of CRRT, mean thiosulfate levels were 3.2 μg/mL (range, 2.4-3.7 μg/mL) accompanied by clinical improvement with metabolic stabilization of blood gas, acylcarnitine, organic acid, and acylglycine profiles. In conclusion, CRRT may help to regain metabolic control in patients with EE who have an acute metabolic decompensation on chronic treatment with NAC and MNZ."	"To delineate the clinical and genetic characteristics of a girl featuring motor retardation, language retardation and regression, and light persisting diarrhea.The patient was clinically examined and tested by tandem mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing.The proband could not stand and walk alone, and had light persisting diarrhea. She manifested language development retardation and regression. Laboratory tests were all normal, but the screening of metabolic disorders for urine and blood showed deficiency of short chain coenzyme A dehydrogenase due to elevated ethylmalonic acid and butyryl carnitine. By next generation sequencing, two compound heterozygous mutations of the ETHE1 gene, c.2T&gt;A and c.488G&gt;A, were discovered in the proband, which were respectively inherited from her father and mother. Bioinformatics analysis predicted both mutations to be pathogenic. The patient was diagnosed with ethylmalonic encephalopathy. Vitamin B1, B2, Coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine were prescribed. The patient deteriorated and required liver transplantation at 4-year-1-month.Based on the clinical and genetic analysis, the proband was diagnosed with ethylmalonic encephalopathy caused by ETHE1 gene mutation. Next generation sequencing has provided a powerful tool for the diagnosis of such disorders."	"The sulfur dioxygenase ETHE1 oxidizes persulfides in the mitochondrial matrix and is involved in the degradation of L-cysteine and hydrogen sulfide. ETHE1 has an essential but as yet undefined function in early embryo development of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In leaves, ETHE1 is strongly induced by extended darkness and participates in the use of amino acids as alternative respiratory substrates during carbohydrate starvation. Thus, we tested the effect of darkness on seed development in an ETHE1 deficient mutant in comparison to the wild type. Since ETHE1 knock-out is embryo lethal, the knock-down line <i>ethe1-1</i> with about 1% residual sulfur dioxygenase activity was used for this study. We performed phenotypic analysis, metabolite profiling and comparative proteomics in order to investigate the general effect of extended darkness on seed metabolism and further define the specific function of the mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase ETHE1 in seeds. Shading of the siliques had no morphological effect on embryogenesis in wild type plants. However, the developmental delay that was already visible in <i>ethe1-1</i> seeds under control conditions was further enhanced in the darkness. Dark conditions strongly affected seed quality parameters of both wild type and mutant plants. The effect of ETHE1 knock-down on amino acid profiles was clearly different from that found in leaves indicating that in seeds persulfide oxidation interacts with alanine and glycine rather than branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Sulfur dioxygenase deficiency led to defects in endosperm development possibly due to alterations in the cellularization process. In addition, we provide evidence for a potential role of persulfide metabolism in abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction in seeds. We conclude that the knock-down of ETHE1 causes metabolic re-arrangements in seeds that differ from those in leaves. Putative mechanisms that cause the aberrant endosperm and embryo development are discussed."	"Persulfide dioxygenases (PDOs) are abundant in Bacteria and also crucial for H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification in mitochondria. One of the two <i>pdo</i>-genes of the acidophilic bacterium <i>Acidithiobacillus caldus</i> was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli.</i> The protein (<i>Ac</i>PDO) had 0.77 ± 0.1 Fe/subunit and an average specific sulfite formation activity of 111.5 U/mg protein (<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) at 40°C and pH 7.5 with sulfur and GSH following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> for GSH and <i>K</i><sub>cat</sub> were 0.5 mM and 181 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Glutathione persulfide (GSSH) as substrate gave a sigmoidal curve with a <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 122.3 U/mg protein, a <i>K</i><sub>cat</sub> of 198 s<sup>-1</sup> and a Hill coefficient of 2.3 ± 0.22 suggesting positive cooperativity. Gel permeation chromatography and non-denaturing gels showed mostly tetramers. The temperature optimum was 40-45°C, the melting point 63 ± 1.3°C in thermal unfolding experiments, whereas low activity was measurable up to 95°C. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that residues located in the predicted GSH/GSSH binding site and in the central hydrogen bond networks including the iron ligands are essential for activity. Among these, the R<sub>139</sub>A, D<sub>141</sub>A, and H<sub>171</sub>A variants were inactive concomitant to a decrease of their melting points by 3-8 K. Other variants were inactivated without significant melting point change. Two out of five cysteines are likewise essential, both of which lie presumably in close proximity at the surface of the protein (C<sub>87</sub> and C<sub>224</sub>). MalPEG labeling experiments suggests that they form a disulfide bridge. The reducing agent Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was inhibitory besides <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide suggesting an involvement of cysteines and the disulfide in catalysis and/or protein stabilization. Mass spectrometry revealed modification of C<sub>87</sub>, C<sub>137</sub>, and C<sub>224</sub> by 305 mass units equivalent to GSH after incubation with GSSH and with GSH in case of the C<sub>87</sub>A and C<sub>224</sub>A variants. The results of this study suggest that disulfide formation between the two essential surface-exposed cysteines and Cys-S-glutathionylation serve as a protective mechanism against uncontrolled thiol oxidation and the associated loss of enzyme activity."	"Sulfite oxidase, molybdenum cofactor, and ETHE1 deficiencies are autosomal recessive disorders that affect the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. Patients with these disorders present severe neurological dysfunction and basal ganglia abnormalities, accompanied by high levels of thiosulfate in biological fluids and tissues. Aiming to better elucidate the pathophysiology of basal ganglia damage in these disorders, we evaluated the in vivo effects of thiosulfate administration on bioenergetics, oxidative stress, and neural damage in rat striatum. The in vitro effect of thiosulfate on creatine kinase (CK) activity was also studied. In vivo findings showed that thiosulfate administration decreased the activities of CK and citrate synthase, and increased the activity of catalase 30 min after administration. Activities of other antioxidant enzymes, citric acid cycle, and respiratory chain complex enzymes, as well as glutathione concentrations and markers of neural damage, were not altered by thiosulfate 30 min or 7 days after its administration. Thiosulfate also decreased the activity of CK in vitro in striatum of rats, which was prevented by the thiol reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT), the antioxidants glutathione (GSH), melatonin, trolox (hydrosoluble analogue of vitamin E), and lipoic acid. DTT and GSH further prevented thiosulfate-induced decrease of the activity of a purified CK in a medium devoid of biological samples. These data suggest that thiosulfate inhibits CK activity by altering critical sulfhydryl groups of this enzyme. It may be also presumed that bioenergetics impairment and ROS generation induced by thiosulfate are mechanisms underlying the neuropathophysiology of disorders in which this metabolite accumulates."	"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a signaling molecule with many beneficial effects. However, its cellular concentration is strictly regulated to avoid toxicity. Persulfide dioxygenase (PDO or ETHE1) is a mononuclear non-heme iron-containing protein in the sulfide oxidation pathway catalyzing the conversion of GSH persulfide (GSSH) to sulfite and GSH. PDO mutations result in the autosomal-recessive disorder ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE). Here, we developed γ-glutamyl-homocysteinyl-glycine (GHcySH), in which the cysteinyl moiety in GSH is substituted with homocysteine, as a mechanism-based PDO inhibitor. Human PDO used GHcySH as an alternative substrate and converted it to GHcy-SO<sub>2</sub>H, mimicking GS-SO<sub>2</sub>H, the putative oxygenated intermediate formed with the natural substrate. Because GHcy-SO<sub>2</sub>H contains a C-S bond rather than an S-S bond in GS-SO<sub>2</sub>H, it failed to undergo the final hydrolysis step in the catalytic cycle, leading to PDO inhibition. We also characterized the biochemical penalties incurred by the L55P, T136A, C161Y, and R163W mutations reported in EE patients. The variants displayed lower iron content (1.4-11-fold) and lower thermal stability (1.2-1.7-fold) than WT PDO. They also exhibited varying degrees of catalytic impairment; the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values for R163W, L55P, and C161Y PDOs were 18-, 42-, and 65-fold lower, respectively, and the T136A variant was most affected, with a 200-fold lower <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> Like WT enzyme, these variants were inhibited by GHcySH. This study provides the first characterization of an intermediate in the PDO-catalyzed reaction and reports on deficits associated with EE-linked mutations that are distal from the active site."	"Synovitis in osteoarthritis (OA) is a very common condition. However, its underlying mechanism is still not well understood. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of synovitis in OA. The gene expression profile GSE82107 (downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database) included 10 synovial tissues of the OA patients and 7 synovial tissues of healthy people. Subsequently, differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, GO (gene ontology) enrichment analysis, pathway analysis, pathway network analysis, and gene signal network analysis were performed using Gene-Cloud of Biotechnology Information (GCBI). A total of 1,941 DEGs consisting of 1,471 upregulated genes and 470 downregulated genes were determined. Genes such as PSMG3, LRP12 MIA-RAB4B, ETHE1, SFXN1, DAZAP1, RABEP2, and C9orf16 were significantly regulated in synovitis of OA. In particular, the MAPK signalling pathway, apoptosis, and pathways in cancer played the most important roles in the pathway network. The relationships between these pathways were also analysed. Genes such as NRAS, SPHK2, FOS, CXCR4, PLD1, GNAI2, and PLA2G4F were strongly implicated in synovitis of OA. In summary, this study indicated that several molecular mechanisms were implicated in the development and progression of synovitis in OA, thus improving our understanding of OA and offering molecular targets for future therapeutic advances."	"We previously revealed that two major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for stroke latency of the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) under salt-loading were located on chromosome (Chr) 1 and 18. Here, we attempted further dissection of the stroke-QTLs using multiple congenic strains between SHRSP and a stroke-resistant hypertensive rat (SHR). Cox hazard model among subcongenic strains harboring a chromosomal fragment of Chr-1 QTL region showed that the most promising region was a 2.1 Mbp fragment between D1Rat177 and D1Rat97. The QTL region on Chr 18 could not be narrowed down by the analysis, which may be due to multiple QTLs in this region. Nonsynonymous sequence variations were found in four genes (Cblc, Cxcl17, Cic, and Ceacam 19) on the 2.1 Mbp fragment of Chr-1 QTL by whole-genome sequence analysis of SHRSP/Izm and SHR/Izm. Significant changes in protein structure were predicted in CBL-C and CXCL17 using I-TASSER. Comprehensive gene expression analysis in the kidney with a cDNA microarray identified three candidate genes (LOC102548695 (Zinc finger protein 45-like, Zfp45L), Ethe1, and Cxcl17). In conclusion, we successfully narrowed down the QTL region on Chr 1, and identified six candidate genes in this region."	"Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene critical for hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) detoxification. Patients present in infancy with hypotonia, developmental delay, diarrhea, orthostatic acrocyanosis and petechiae. Biochemical findings include elevated C4, C5 acylcarnitines and lactic and ethylmalonic acid (EMA) in body fluids. Current treatment modalities include metronidazole and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to lower the production and promote detoxification of toxic H<sub>2</sub>S. Patients are typically identified after the onset of clinical symptoms and there is limited information about long term response to treatment. We report the findings of two unrelated patients with EE, identified through newborn screening, who were managed with conventional treatment (NAC, metronidazole alternated with neomycin) and in patient 2, a novel dietary treatment restricting sulfur containing amino acids. Pathogenic mutations were confirmed in the ETHE1 gene (homozygous splice site mutation in patient 1, c.505 + 1G &gt; A; compound heterozygous mutations in patient 2, c.131_132delAG + c.566delG). Both patients were started on metronidazole and NAC by 10 weeks of age and treated for 23 months. Patient 1 did not accept the metabolic formula due to palatability and parental refusal for gastrostomy tube placement. She demonstrated improved biomarkers (EMA, lactic acid and thiosulfate) and an attenuated clinical course. Patient 2 was started on a low methionine and cysteine diet at 8 months of age utilizing SOD Anamix® Early Years, (Nutricia). Baseline EMA levels were (642 mg/g Cr; n = 2) and decreased with medical treatment by 38% to a mean of 399 (n = 4, SD = 71, p 0.0013). With dietary treatment EMA levels were further reduced by 42% to a mean of 233 (n = 8, SD = 52, p 0.0030). Lactic acid, thiosulfates and clinical outcomes were also improved. Our long-term follow-up confirms previous reports of clinical improvement with NAC and metronidazole treatment. Additionally, our studies suggest that a diet restricted in sulfur-containing amino acids results in further improvement in clinical outcomes and biochemical markers."	"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common type of behavioral cancers, miRNAs play a critical role in cancer development and progression. In the present study, we downloaded the original data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and conduct data analysis. has-mir-29c-3p mimic, inhibitor, negative control or si-SPARC (secreted protein acidic, rich in cysteine) were transfected into HCT116 cells, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure has-mir-29c-3p and SPARC mRNA expressions, western blot was used to detect ACAA1 (acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1), ACOX1 (acyl-CoA oxidase 1), COL1A1(collagen, type I, alpha-1), COL1A2 (collagen, type I, alpha-2), COL4A1 (collagen, type IV, alpha-1), COL5A2 (collagen, type V, alpha-2), COL12A1 (collagen, type XII, alpha-1), CPT2 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2), ETHE1 (persulfide dioxygenase), HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2), SPARC, SQRDL (sulfide quinone oxidoreductase), and TST (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase) protein expression. CCK-8 and wound healing assay were employed to verify cell proliferation and migration. The luciferase reporter assay data made sure the target correlation of has-mir-29c-3p and SPARC. Firstly, we found that the expression of has-mir-29c-3p was lower in CRC tissues than in their paired corresponding non-cancerous tissues and there was significant inversed correlation between has-mir-29c-3p and SPARC. Overexpression of has-mir-29c-3p reduced cell proliferation and migration. SPARC was identified as a direct target of has-mir-29c-3p, whose silencing reduced cell proliferation and migration. These data showed that has-mir-29c-3p regulates CRC cell functions through regulating SPARC expression. Taken together, has-mir-29c-3p may function as an oncogenic miRNA targeting SPARC, targeted modulation of has-mir-29c-3p expression may became a potential strategy for the treatment."	"Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of mortality from malignant tumors worldwide. Currently, a lack of serological biomarkers for early LC diagnosis is a major roadblock for early intervention and prevention of LC. To undertake this challenge, we employed a two-phase strategy to discover and validate a biomarker panel using a protein array-based approach. In Phase I, we obtained serological autoimmune profiles of 80 LC patients and 20 healthy subjects on HuProt arrays, and identified 170 candidate proteins significantly associated with LC. In Phase II, we constructed a LC focused array with the 170 proteins, and profiled a large cohort, comprised of 352 LC patients, 93 healthy individuals, and 101 patients with lung benign lesions (LBL). The comparison of autoimmune profiles between the early stage LC and the combined group of healthy and LBL allowed us to identify and validate a biomarker panel of p53, HRas, and ETHE1 for diagnosis of early stage LC with 50% sensitivity at &gt;90% specificity. Finally, the performance of this biomarker panel was confirmed in ELISA tests. In summary, this study represents one of the most comprehensive proteome-wide surveys with one of the largest (<i>i.e.</i> 1,101 unique samples) and most diverse (<i>i.e.</i> nine disease groups) cohorts, resulting in a biomarker panel with good performance."	"Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is a severe, early-onset, progressive disorder characterized by developmental delay / mild-to-severe intellectual disability; generalized infantile hypotonia that evolves into hypertonia, spasticity, and (in some instances) dystonia; generalized tonic-clonic seizures; and generalized microvascular damage (diffuse and spontaneous relapsing petechial purpura, hemorrhagic suffusions of mucosal surfaces, and chronic hemorrhagic diarrhea). Infants sometimes have frequent vomiting and loss of social interaction. Speech is delayed and in some instances absent. Swallowing difficulties and failure to thrive are common. Children may be unable to walk without support and may be wheelchair bound. Neurologic deterioration accelerates following intercurrent infectious illness, and the majority of children die in the first decade.The diagnosis of EE is suggested by clinical findings and the laboratory findings of increased blood lactate levels, C4- and C5-acylcarnitine esters, plasma thiosulphate, and urinary ethylmalonic acid. The diagnosis is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>ETHE1</i> on molecular genetic testing.<i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Multi-specialty care that includes child neurology, pediatrics, clinical genetics, nutrition, gastroenterology, pain management, and physical therapy can help with timely detection and treatment of the multiorgan dysfunction that characterizes EE. Treatment is primarily supportive including antispastic medications, muscle relaxants, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Physical therapy early in the disease course can help prevent contractures. For severe diarrhea, it is important to maintain hydration and caloric intake. Tube feeding is often necessary. <i>Prevention of secondary complications:</i> Prevention of infections that could be fatal. <i>Surveillance:</i> Recommendations based on individual patient findings can include: monitoring of feeding and electrolyte status particularly in those with severe diarrhea; monitoring of seizures and response to AEDs.EE is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. No individuals diagnosed with EE have been known to reproduce. Once the <i>ETHE1</i> pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible."

"LRPPRC"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Mutants in the gene encoding mitochondrion-associated protein LRPPRC were found to be associated with French Canadian Type Leigh syndrome, a human disorder characterized with neurodegeneration and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. LRPPRC interacts with one of microtubule-associated protein family MAP1S that promotes autophagy initiation and maturation to suppress genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Previously, although various studies have attributed LRPPRC nuclear acid-associated functions, we characterized that LRPPRC acted as an inhibitor of autophagy in human cancer cells. Here we show that liver-specific deletion of LRPPRC causes liver-specific increases of YAP and P27 and decreases of P62, leading to an increase of cell polyploidy and an impairment of autophagy maturation. The blockade of autophagy maturation and promotion of polyploidy caused by LRPPRC depletion synergistically enhances diethylnitrosamine-induced DNA damage, genome instability, and further tumorigenesis so that LRPPRC knockout mice develop more and larger hepatocellular carcinomas and survive a shorter lifespan. Therefore, LRPPRC suppresses genome instability and hepatocellular carcinomas and promotes survivals in mice by sustaining Yap-P27-mediated cell ploidy and P62-HDAC6-controlled autophagy maturation."	"Leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein (LRP130) is implicated in the control of mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation in the liver, partly due to its interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). To investigate LRP130's role in healthy human skeletal muscle, we examined LRP130's fiber-type distribution and subcellular localization (n = 6), as well as LRP130's relationship with PGC-1α protein and citrate synthase (CS) maximal activity (n = 33) in vastus lateralis samples obtained from young males. The impact of an acute bout of exercise (endurance [END] and sprint interval training [SIT]) and fasting (8 h) on LRP130 and PGC-1α expression was also determined (n = 10). LRP130 protein content paralleled fiber-specific succinate dehydrogenase activity (I &gt; IIA) and strongly correlated with the mitochondrially localized protein apoptosis-inducing factor in type I (r = 0.75) and type IIA (r = 0.85) fibers. Whole-muscle LRP130 protein content was positively related to PGC-1α protein (r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.01) and CS maximal activity (r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.01). LRP130 mRNA expression was unaltered (p &gt; 0.05) following exercise, despite ~ 6.6- and ~ 3.8-fold increases (p &lt; 0.01) in PGC-1α mRNA expression after END and SIT, respectively. Although unchanged at the group level (p &gt; 0.05), moderate-to-strong positive correlations were apparent between individual changes in LRP130 and PGC-1α expression at the mRNA (r = 0.63, p &lt; 0.05) and protein (r = 0.59, p = 0.07) level in response to fasting. Our findings support a potential role for LRP130 in the maintenance of basal mitochondrial phenotype in human skeletal muscle. LRP130's importance for mitochondrial remodeling in exercised and fasted human skeletal muscle requires further investigation."	"Various liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevation of nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we subjected the human liver mitochondrial proteome to extensive quantitative proteomic profiling analysis and molecular characterization to identify potential signatures indicative of cancer cell growth and progression. Sequential proteomic analysis identified 2452 mitochondrial proteins, of which 1464 and 2010 were classified as nontumor and tumor (HCC) mitochondrial proteins, respectively, with 1022 overlaps. Further metabolic mapping of the HCC mitochondrial proteins narrowed our biological characterization to four proteins, namely, ALDH4A1, LRPPRC, ATP5C1, and ALDH6A1. The latter protein, a mitochondrial methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH6A1), was most strongly suppressed in HCC tumor regions (∼10-fold decrease) in contrast to LRPPRC (∼6-fold increase) and was predicted to be present in plasma. Accordingly, we selected ALDH6A1 for functional analysis and engineered Hep3B cells to overexpress this protein, called ALDH6A1-O/E cells. Since ALDH6A1 is predicted to be involved in mitochondrial respiration, we assessed changes in the levels of NO and ROS in the overexpressed cell lines. Surprisingly, in ALDH6A1-O/E cells, NO was decreased nearly 50% but ROS was increased at a similar level, while the former was restored by treatment with <i>S</i>-nitroso-<i>N</i>-acetyl-penicillamine. The lactate levels were also decreased relative to control cells. Propidium iodide and Rhodamine-123 staining suggested that the decrease in NO and increase in ROS in ALDH6A1-O/E cells could be caused by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). Taken together, our results suggest that hepatic neoplastic transformation appears to suppress the expression of ALDH6A1, which is accompanied by a respective increase and decrease in NO and ROS in cancer cells. Given the close link between ALDH6A1 suppression and abnormal cancer cell growth, this protein may serve as a potential molecular signature or biomarker of hepatocarcinogenesis and treatment responses."	"Transmission from an infected mosquito to a host is an essential process in the life cycle of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mosquito saliva facilitates viral transmission. Here we find that a saliva-specific protein, named Aedes aegypti venom allergen-1 (AaVA-1), promotes dengue and Zika virus transmission by activating autophagy in host immune cells of the monocyte lineage. The AG6 mice (ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup>) bitten by the virus-infected AaVA-1-deficient mosquitoes present a lower viremia and prolonged survival. AaVA-1 intracellularly interacts with a dominant negative binder of Beclin-1, known as leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), and releases Beclin-1 from LRPPRC-mediated sequestration, thereby enabling the initialization of downstream autophagic signaling. A deficiency in Beclin-1 reduces viral infection in mice and abolishes AaVA-1-mediated enhancement of ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes. Our study provides a mechanistic insight into saliva-aided viral transmission and could offer a potential prophylactic target for reducing flavivirus transmission."	"It is well known that cells rely on mitochondrial respiration for survival. However, the effect of microRNAs (miRNAs) on mitochondria of cells has not been extensively explored. Our results indicated that the overexpression of a miRNA (miR-1) could destroy mitochondria of cancer stem cells. miR-1 was downregulated in melanoma stem cells (MSCs) and breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) compared with cancer non-stem cells. However, the upregulation of miR-1 in cancer non-stem cells did not induce mitochondrial damage. miR-1 overexpression caused mitochondrial damage of cancer stem cells by directly targeting the 3' UTRs of MINOS1 (mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system 1) and GPD2 (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2) genes and interacting with LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide-repeat containing) protein, a protein localized in mitochondria. MINOS1, GPD2, and LRPPRC in mitochondria were required for mitochondrial inner membrane. The results of in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that miR-1 overexpression induced mitophagy of cancer stem cells. Therefore, our study contributed novel insights into the mechanism of miRNA-mediated regulation of mitochondria morphology of cancer stem cells."	"Therapeutic target identification and corresponding drug development is a demanding task for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, especially the most malignant proximal-proliferative subtype without druggable protein kinase mutations. Using a cell-SELEX-generated aptamer, we discovered a new tumor driver protein, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), which is specifically overexpressed in the most lethal subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. Targeted LRPPRC protein knockdown is a promising therapeutic strategy for the undruggable LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). Nevertheless, LRPPRC is mainly located in mitochondria and degraded by protease. Current protein knockdown approaches, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have limitations in their applications to the proteins degraded through proteasome-independent ways. Here, we designed an aptamer-assisted high-throughput method to screen small molecules that could bind to LRPPRC directly, disrupt the interaction of LRPPRC with its stabilizing chaperon protein, and lead to LRPPRC degradation by mitochondrial protease. The screened compound, gossypolacetic acid (GAA), is an old medicine that can accomplish the new function for targeted LRPPRC knockdown. It showed significant antitumor effects even with the LRPPRC-positive patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model. This work not only extended the application of aptamers to screen small-molecule inhibitors for the undruggable lung cancers, but more importantly provided a new strategy to develop protein knockdown methods beyond the proteasome system."	"Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined by the loss or dysfunction of ovarian follicles associated with amenorrhea before the age of 40. Symptoms include hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and depression, as well as reduced fertility and increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. POI occurs in ∼1% to 2% of women, although the etiology of most cases remains unexplained. Approximately 10% to 20% of POI cases are due to mutations in a single gene or a chromosomal abnormality, which has provided considerable molecular insight into the biological underpinnings of POI. Many of the genes for which mutations have been associated with POI, either isolated or syndromic cases, function within mitochondria, including MRPS22, POLG, TWNK, LARS2, HARS2, AARS2, CLPP, and LRPPRC. Collectively, these genes play roles in mitochondrial DNA replication, gene expression, and protein synthesis and degradation. Although mutations in these genes clearly implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in rare cases of POI, data are scant as to whether these genes in particular, and mitochondrial dysfunction in general, contribute to most POI cases that lack a known etiology. Further studies are needed to better elucidate the contribution of mitochondria to POI and determine whether there is a common molecular defect in mitochondrial function that distinguishes mitochondria-related genes that when mutated cause POI vs those that do not. Nonetheless, the clear implication of mitochondrial dysfunction in POI suggests that manipulation of mitochondrial function represents an important therapeutic target for the treatment or prevention of POI."	"The RNA helicase SUV3 and the polynucleotide phosphorylase PNPase are involved in the degradation of mitochondrial mRNAs but their roles in vivo are not fully understood. Additionally, upstream processes, such as transcript maturation, have been linked to some of these factors, suggesting either dual roles or tightly interconnected mechanisms of mitochondrial RNA metabolism. To get a better understanding of the turn-over of mitochondrial RNAs in vivo, we manipulated the mitochondrial mRNA degrading complex in Drosophila melanogaster models and studied the molecular consequences. Additionally, we investigated if and how these factors interact with the mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase, MTPAP, as well as with the mitochondrial mRNA stabilising factor, LRPPRC. Our results demonstrate a tight interdependency of mitochondrial mRNA stability, polyadenylation and the removal of antisense RNA. Furthermore, disruption of degradation, as well as polyadenylation, leads to the accumulation of double-stranded RNAs, and their escape out into the cytoplasm is associated with an altered immune-response in flies. Together our results suggest a highly organised and inter-dependable regulation of mitochondrial RNA metabolism with far reaching consequences on cellular physiology."	"Mitochondrial dysfunction characterizes many rare and common age-associated diseases. The biochemical consequences, underlying clinical manifestations, and potential therapeutic targets, remain to be better understood. We tested the hypothesis that lipid dyshomeostasis in mitochondrial disorders goes beyond mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, particularly in liver. This was achieved using comprehensive untargeted and targeted lipidomics in a case-control cohort of patients with Leigh syndrome French-Canadian variant (LSFC), a mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in LRPPRC, and in mice harboring liver-specific inactivation of Lrpprc (H-Lrpprc-/-). We discovered a plasma lipid signature discriminating LSFC patients from controls encompassing lower levels of plasmalogens and conjugated bile acids, which suggest perturbations in peroxisomal lipid metabolism. This premise was reinforced in H-Lrpprc-/- mice, which compared with littermates recapitulated a similar, albeit stronger peroxisomal metabolic signature in plasma and liver including elevated levels of very-long-chain acylcarnitines. These mice also presented higher transcript levels for hepatic markers of peroxisome proliferation in addition to lipid remodeling reminiscent of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Our study underscores the value of lipidomics to unveil unexpected mechanisms underlying lipid dyshomeostasis ensuing from mitochondrial dysfunction herein implying peroxisomes and liver, which likely contribute to the pathophysiology of LSFC, but also other rare and common mitochondrial diseases."	"Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains are evolutionarily conserved in proteins that function in development and immunity. Here we report strict exonic modularity of LRR domains of several human gene families, which is a precondition for alternative splicing (AS). We provide evidence for AS of LRR domain within several Nod-like receptors, most prominently the inflammasome sensor NLRP3. Human NLRP3, but not mouse NLRP3, is expressed as two major isoforms, the full-length variant and a variant lacking exon 5. Moreover, NLRP3 AS is stochastically regulated, with NLRP3 ∆ exon 5 lacking the interaction surface for NEK7 and hence loss of activity. Our data thus reveals unexpected regulatory roles of AS through differential utilization of LRRs modules in vertebrate innate immunity."	"A term girl infant delivered following foetal distress presented with early respiratory distress syndrome and lactic acidaemia. She subsequently underwent detailed investigation for primary lactic acidaemia and was identified as homozygous for the c.515A&gt;G,p.(Tyr172Cys) missense variant in the <i>LRPPRC</i> gene. Variants in this gene are known to cause French-Canadian type Leigh syndrome. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous for this mutation. This is the first case report of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV deficiency presenting as foetal distress and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome."	"Objective To investigate the effects of leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) on proliferation and apoptosis in hormone resistant prostate cancer cells. Methods LRPPRC and androgen receptor (AR) expressions in DU145 and LNCaP cells were detected by Western blot analysis. The siRNA targeting LRPPRC gene was transiently transfected into DU145 cells. LRPPRC expression was detected by reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis. The cell survival rate was analyzed by MTT assay. ATP was measured by luciferin-luciferase assay. The cell apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining. Caspase-3, Bcl2 and BAX protein expressions were detected by Western blot analysis. Results DU145 and LNCaP cells highly expressed LRPPRC. LNCaP cells highly expressed AR, while no expression of AR was observed in DU145 cells. Down-regulation of LRPPRC decreased cell survival rate and ATP level, increased apoptosis rate and caspase-3 activation, and decreased Bcl2 expression in DU145 cells. Conclusion Knock-down of LRPPRC promotes apoptosis of hormone resistant prostate cancer cells."	"The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family plays a major role in RNA stability, regulation, processing, splicing, translation, and editing. Leucine-rich PPR-motif-containing protein (LRPPRC), a member of the PPR family, is a known gene mutation that causes Leigh syndrome French-Canadian. Recently, growing evidence has pointed out that LRPPRC dysregulation is related to various diseases ranging from tumors to viral infections. This review presents available published data on the LRPPRC protein function and its role in tumors and other diseases. As a multi-functional protein, LRPPRC regulates a myriad of biological processes, including energy metabolism and maturation and the export of nuclear mRNA. Overexpression of LRPPRC has been observed in various human tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. Downregulation of LRPPRC inhibits growth and invasion, induces apoptosis, and overcomes drug resistance in tumor cells. In addition, LRPPRC plays a potential role in Parkinson's disease, neurofibromatosis 1, viral infections, and venous thromboembolism. Further investigating these new functions of LRPPRC should provide novel opportunities for a better understanding of its pathological role in diseases from tumors to viral infections and as a potential biomarker and molecular target for disease treatment."	"Oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) can induce injury of endothelial cells, causing atherosclerosis, which is an important initial event in several cardiovascular diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of diverse biological processes, but their specific biological functions and biochemical mechanisms in ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell injury have not been well investigated. Here, we describe the initial functional analysis of a poorly characterized human lncRNA ZEB1 antisense 1 (ZEB1-AS1). We found that ox-LDL treatment could induce a decreased cell viability and an increased cell apoptosis in endothelial cells, and knockdown of ZEB1-AS1 significantly reversed this effect. Mechanistically, ox-LDL treatment could sequester p53 from binding to ZEB1-AS1 promoter region, causing transcriptional activation and upregulation of ZEB1-AS1. Moreover, enhanced ZEB1-AS1 could upregulate Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain 2 (NOD2) expression through recruiting leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) to stabilize NOD2 mRNA. Experimental data showed that knockdown of NOD2 or LRPPRC dramatically abrogated the functional role of ZEB1-AS1 in ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell injury. In summary, we demonstrated that lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 regulates the ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell injury via an LRPPRC-dependent mRNA stabilization mechanism. Therefore, ZEB1-AS1 may serve as a multi-potency target to overcome endothelial cell injury, atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases."	"Leigh syndrome French Canadian type (LSFC) is a mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (LRPPRC) gene leading to a reduction of cytochrome-<i>c</i> oxidase (COX) expression reaching 50% in skin fibroblasts. We have shown that under basal conditions, LSFC and control cells display similar ATP levels. We hypothesized that this occurs through upregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated metabolic reprogramming. Our results showed that compared with controls, LSFC cells exhibited an upregulation of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 ribosomal S6 kinase pathway and higher levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and its downstream target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1), a regulator of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase 1 (PDH1). Consistent with these signaling alterations, LSFC cells displayed a 40-61% increase in [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose contribution to pyruvate, lactate, and alanine formation, as well as higher levels of the phosphorylated and inactive form of PDH1-α. Interestingly, inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin did not alter HIF-1α or PDHK1 protein levels in LSFC fibroblasts. However, this treatment increased PDH1-α phosphorylation in control and LSFC cells and reduced ATP levels in control cells. Rapamycin also decreased LRPPRC expression by 41 and 11% in LSFC and control cells, respectively, and selectively reduced COX subunit IV expression in LSFC fibroblasts. Taken together, our data demonstrate the importance of mTORC1, independent of the HIF-1α/PDHK1 axis, in maintaining LRPPRC and COX expression in LSFC cells."	"The prognosis for patients with bladder cancer (BCa) with lymph node (LN) metastasis is poor, and it is not improved by current treatments. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the pathology of various tumors, including BCa. However, the role of Differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA (DANCR) in BCa LN metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we discover that DANCR was significantly upregulated in BCa tissues and cases with LN metastasis. DANCR expression was positively correlated with LN metastasis status, tumor stage, histological grade, and poor patient prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that DANCR promoted BCa cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor LN metastasis and growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that DANCR activated IL-11-STAT3 signaling and increased cyclin D1 and PLAU expression via guiding leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) to stabilize mRNA. Moreover, oncogenesis facilitated by DANCR was attenuated by anti-IL-11 antibody or a STAT3 inhibitor (BP-1-102). In conclusion, our findings indicate that DANCR induces BCa LN metastasis and proliferation via an LRPPRC-mediated mRNA stabilization mechanism. DANCR may serve as a multi-potency target for clinical intervention in LN-metastatic BCa."	"Leigh syndrome, French Canadian type is a rare neurodegenerative disease. To our knowledge, there have been no studies based on ocular findings published for this disease. The purpose of this study is to describe ophthalmic findings in these patients.Six patients genetically identified as having the syndrome were included in this study.Four patients had an ophthalmic examination with an ophthalmologist including evaluation of visual acuity, extraocular motility and lid position, orthoptic workup, evaluation of stereopsis, refraction, evaluation of pupils, color vision, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, measurement of intraocular pressure, and fundoscopy. Two patients had a chart review.Visual acuity ranged from 0.00 logmar to 1.55 logmar. Extraocular motility abnormalities and ptosis were noted in half of the patients. Strabismus was present in the entire cohort, and stereopsis was absent in half of these patients. Amblyopia was noted in 83% of individuals and suppression in 33%. Only one patient had nystagmus. Refraction varied throughout patients. It included severe hyperopia, myopia, astigmatism, and significant anisometropia. Pupils, anterior segment, fundus, and color vision were normal in all patients. Intraocular pressure was slightly elevated in one patient.Patients with Leigh syndrome, French Canadian type display a variety of ophthalmic findings, and screening at a young age is recommended."	"Increased expression of RNA polymerase 1 (POL1) molecular pathway was reported to be associated with increased disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the operating molecular mechanisms that characterize the pattern of acute MS relapse activity has not been thoroughly studied.To assess POL1 pathway expression during acute MS relapse.We studied POL1 pathway associated biomarkers during the first acute optic neuritis attack of MS, and in relapsing-remitting MS patients treated with disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) experiencing an acute MS relapse or a radiological relapse using gene expression microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR.In MS patients (N = 6) during the first acute optic neuritis attack POL1 pathway activation was evident by over-expression of POL1 related network including transcription factor UBTF and downstream components of Assembly of RNA POL1 complex (p=1.92E-03). POL1 related biomarkers RRN3, POLR1D and LRPPRC were over-expressed x1.6 (p = .002), ×1.7 (p = .01) and x2.0 (p = .001) times higher respectively, in MS patients (N = 30) during acute clinical relapse as compared with remission. Similarly, in MS patients (N = 21) that presented with a radiological relapse, we observed significant activation of POL1 related biomarkers including RRN3 (p = .01), POLR1D (p = .002), POLR1E (p = .0001) and LRPPRC (p = .006), as compared with remission, as well as overexpression of a large group of genes encoding ribosomal proteins like RPS6KA3 (p = 7.2E-6), RRP8 (p = .0002) and RPCS9 (p = .0008).Our findings demonstrated increased POL1 pathway activity in acute MS relapse and suggest that targeted inactivation of POL1 pathway represent a novel strategy for a better treatment of acute MS relapse."

"NDUFS1"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Caloric reduction (CR) is considered as the most reasonable intervention to delay aging and age-related diseases. Numerous studies in various model organisms provide the main basis for this hypothesis. Human studies exist, but they differ widely in study design, characteristics of test persons and study outcome. In this study we investigated CR in humans on a molecular level to gain a better understanding in these processes. For that purpose, we analyzed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy people fasting according to F. X. Mayr. In a previous study our group could show a significantly improved DNA repair capacity after fasting. Here we were able to confirm these findings despite a slightly modified fasting therapy. Furthermore, the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the mRNA levels of the mitochondria-associated genes SIRT3 and NDUFS1 were significantly affected by CR. However, these changes were only detectable in people who exhibited no improvement in DNA repair capacity. In contrast to that we could not observe any changes in ROS levels, mitochondrial DNA copy number and non-mitochondrial respiration. Altogether our results reveal that CR in form of F. X. Mayr therapy is able to positively influence several cellular parameters and especially mitochondrial function. Mitochondria Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells."	"Diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterised by increased oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributes to the increased risk of heart failure in individuals with diabetes. Considering that A-kinase anchoring protein 121 (AKAP1) is localised in the mitochondrial outer membrane and plays key roles in the regulation of mitochondrial function, this study aimed to investigate the role of AKAP1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy and explore its underlying mechanisms.Loss- and gain-of-function approaches were used to investigate the role of AKAP1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected into Akap1-knockout (Akap1-KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates to induce diabetes. In addition, primary neonatal cardiomyocytes treated with high glucose were used as a cell model of diabetes. Cardiac function was assessed with echocardiography. Akap1 overexpression was conducted by injecting adeno-associated virus 9 carrying Akap1 (AAV9-Akap1). LC-MS/MS analysis and functional experiments were used to explore underlying molecular mechanisms.AKAP1 was downregulated in the hearts of STZ-induced diabetic mouse models. Akap1-KO significantly aggravated cardiac dysfunction in the STZ-treated diabetic mice when compared with WT diabetic littermates, as evidenced by the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; STZ-treated WT mice [WT/STZ] vs STZ-treated Akap1-KO mice [KO/STZ], 51.6% vs 41.6%). Mechanistically, Akap1 deficiency impaired mitochondrial respiratory function characterised by reduced ATP production. Additionally, Akap1 deficiency increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis via enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis indicated that AKAP1 interacted with the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit (NDUFS1). Specifically, Akap1 deficiency inhibited complex I activity by preventing translocation of NDUFS1 from the cytosol to mitochondria. Akap1 deficiency was also related to decreased ATP production and enhanced mitochondrial ROS-related apoptosis. In contrast, restoration of AKAP1 expression in the hearts of STZ-treated diabetic mice promoted translocation of NDUFS1 to mitochondria and alleviated diabetic cardiomyopathy in the LVEF (WT/STZ injected with adeno-associated virus carrying gfp [AAV9-gfp] vs WT/STZ AAV9-Akap1, 52.4% vs 59.6%; KO/STZ AAV9-gfp vs KO/STZ AAV9-Akap1, 42.2% vs 57.6%).Our study provides the first evidence that Akap1 deficiency exacerbates diabetic cardiomyopathy by impeding mitochondrial translocation of NDUFS1 to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Our findings suggest that Akap1 upregulation has therapeutic potential for myocardial injury in individuals with diabetes."	"Leigh syndrome (LS), the most common childhood mitochondrial disorder, has characteristic clinical and neuroradiologic features. Mutations in more than 75 genes have been identified in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genome, implicating a high degree of genetic heterogeneity in LS. To profile these genetic signatures and understand the pathophysiology of LS, we recruited 64 patients from 62 families who were clinically diagnosed with LS at Seoul National University Children's Hospital. Mitochondrial genetic analysis followed by whole-exome sequencing was performed on 61 patients. Pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA were identified in 18 families and nuclear DNA mutations in 22. The following 17 genes analyzed in 40 families were found to have genetic complexity: MTATP6, MTND1, MTND3, MTND5, MTND6, MTTK, NDUFS1, NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, SURF1, SLC19A3, ECHS1, PNPT1, IARS2, NARS2, VPS13D, and NAXE. Two treatable cases had biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease, and another three were identified as having defects in the newly recognized genes (VPS13D or NAXE). Variants in the nuclear genes that encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases were present in 27.3% of cases. Our findings expand the genetic and clinical spectrum of LS, showing genetic heterogeneity and highlighting treatable cases and those with novel genetic causes."	"Patients with coexistent chronic heart failure (CHF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) demonstrate greater exercise limitation and worse prognosis compared with CHF patients without DM, even when corrected for cardiac dysfunction. Understanding the origins of symptoms in this subgroup may facilitate development of targeted treatments. We therefore characterized the skeletal muscle phenotype and its relationship to exercise limitation in patients with diabetic heart failure (D-HF).In one of the largest muscle sampling studies in a CHF population, pectoralis major biopsies were taken from age-matched controls (n = 25), DM (n = 10), CHF (n = 52), and D-HF (n = 28) patients. In situ mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species, fibre morphology, capillarity, and gene expression analyses were performed and correlated to whole-body exercise capacity.Mitochondrial respiration, content, coupling efficiency, and intrinsic function were lower in D-HF patients compared with other groups (P &lt; 0.05). A unique mitochondrial complex I dysfunction was present in D-HF patients only (P &lt; 0.05), which strongly correlated to exercise capacity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64; P &lt; 0.001). Mitochondrial impairments in D-HF corresponded to higher levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (P &lt; 0.05) and lower gene expression of anti-oxidative enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (P &lt; 0.05) and complex I subunit NDUFS1 (P &lt; 0.05). D-HF was also associated with severe fibre atrophy (P &lt; 0.05) and reduced local fibre capillarity (P &lt; 0.05).Patients with D-HF develop a specific skeletal muscle pathology, characterized by mitochondrial impairments, fibre atrophy, and derangements in the capillary network that are linked to exercise intolerance. These novel preliminary data support skeletal muscle as a potential therapeutic target for treating patients with D-HF."	"Analysis of human muscle diseases highlights the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle. Our previous work revealed that diverse upstream events correlated with altered mitochondrial proteome in human muscle biopsies. However, several proteins showed relatively unchanged expression suggesting that post-translational modifications, mainly protein phosphorylation could influence their activity and regulate mitochondrial processes. We conducted mitochondrial phosphoprotein profiling, by proteomics approach, of healthy human skeletal muscle (n = 10) and three muscle diseases (n = 10 each): Dysferlinopathy, Polymyositis and Distal Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles. Healthy human muscle mitochondrial proteins displayed 253 phosphorylation sites (phosphosites), which contributed to metabolic and redox processes and mitochondrial organization etc. Electron transport chain complexes accounted for 84 phosphosites. Muscle pathologies displayed 33 hyperphosphorylated and 14 hypophorphorylated sites with only 5 common proteins, indicating varied phosphorylation profile across muscle pathologies. Molecular modelling revealed altered local structure in the phosphorylated sites of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 and complex V subunit ATP5B1. Molecular dynamics simulations in complex I subunits NDUFV1, NDUFS1 and NDUFV2 revealed that phosphorylation induced structural alterations thereby influencing electron transfer and potentially altering enzyme activity. We propose that altered phosphorylation at specific sites could regulate mitochondrial protein function in the skeletal muscle during physiological and pathological processes."	"Antioxidant supplementation in idiopathic male infertility has a beneficial effect on semen parameters. However, the molecular mechanism behind this effect has not been reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sperm proteome of idiopathic infertile men pre- and post-antioxidant supplementation. Idiopathic infertile men were provided with oral antioxidant supplementation once daily for a period of 6 months. Of the 379 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between pre- and post-antioxidant treatment patients, the majority of the proteins (<i>n</i> = 274) were overexpressed following antioxidant treatment. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the activation of oxidative phosphorylation pathway and upregulation of key proteins involved in spermatogenesis, sperm maturation, binding of sperm, fertilization and normal reproductive function. In addition, the transcriptional factors associated with antioxidant defense system (PPARGC1A) and free radical scavenging (NFE2L2) were predicted to be functionally activated post-treatment. Key DEPs, namely, NDUFS1, CCT3, PRKARA1 and SPA17 validated by Western blot showed significant overexpression post-treatment. Our novel proteomic findings suggest that antioxidant supplementation in idiopathic infertile men improves sperm function at the molecular level by modulating proteins involved in CREM signaling, mitochondrial function and protein oxidation. Further, activation of TRiC complex helped in nuclear compaction, maintenance of telomere length, flagella function, and expression of zona pellucida receptors for sperm-oocyte interaction."	"Complex I (CI) is the first enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and couples the electron transfer with proton pumping. Mutations in genes encoding CI subunits can frequently cause inborn metabolic errors. We applied proteome and metabolome profiling of patient-derived cells harboring pathogenic mutations in two distinct CI genes to elucidate underlying pathomechanisms on the molecular level. Our results indicated that the electron transfer within CI was interrupted in both patients by different mechanisms. We showed that the biallelic mutations in <i>NDUFS1</i> led to a decreased stability of the entire N-module of CI and disrupted the electron transfer between two iron-sulfur clusters. Strikingly interesting and in contrast to the proteome, metabolome profiling illustrated that the pattern of dysregulated metabolites was almost identical in both patients, such as the inhibitory feedback on the TCA cycle and altered glutathione levels, indicative for reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Our findings deciphered pathological mechanisms of CI deficiency to better understand inborn metabolic errors."	"Conotruncal heart defects (CTDs) are among the most common and severe groups of congenital heart defects. Despite evidence of an inherited genetic contribution to CTDs, little is known about the specific genes that contribute to the development of CTDs. We performed gene-based genome-wide analyses using microarray-genotyped and imputed common and rare variants data from two large studies of CTDs in the United States. We performed two case-parent trio analyses (N = 640 and 317 trios), using an extension of the family-based multi-marker association test, and two case-control analyses (N = 482 and 406 patients and comparable numbers of controls), using a sequence kernel association test. We also undertook two meta-analyses to combine the results from the analyses that used the same approach (i.e. family-based or case-control). To our knowledge, these analyses are the first reported gene-based, genome-wide association studies of CTDs. Based on our findings, we propose eight CTD candidate genes (ARF5, EIF4E, KPNA1, MAP4K3, MBNL1, NCAPG, NDFUS1 and PSMG3). Four of these genes (ARF5, KPNA1, NDUFS1 and PSMG3) have not been previously associated with normal or abnormal heart development. In addition, our analyses provide additional evidence that genes involved in chromatin-modification and in ribonucleic acid splicing are associated with congenital heart defects."	"MDM2 (mouse double minute 2) functions as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene, yet little is known if MDM2 regulates cancer cell biology by altering cellular metabolism. We recently found that MDM2 binds NDUFS1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1), a key protein involved in Complex I assembly, function, and efficiency. The MDM2⋅NDUFS1 interaction promotes reactive oxygen species production, DNA damage, and apoptosis."	"Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) optimizes systemic oxygen delivery by matching ventilation to perfusion. HPV is intrinsic to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Hypoxia dilates systemic arteries, including renal arteries. Hypoxia is sensed by changes in mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, notably hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) ([H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>mito</sub>). Decreases in [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>mito</sub> elevate pulmonary vascular tone by increasing intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) through reduction-oxidation regulation of ion channels. Although HPV is mimicked by the Complex I inhibitor, rotenone, the molecular identity of the O<sub>2</sub> sensor is unknown.To determine the role of Ndufs2 (NADH [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide] dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 2), Complex I's rotenone binding site, in pulmonary vascular oxygen-sensing.Mitochondria-conditioned media from pulmonary and renal mitochondria isolated from normoxic and chronically hypoxic rats were infused into an isolated lung bioassay. Mitochondria-conditioned media from normoxic lungs contained more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than mitochondria-conditioned media from chronic hypoxic lungs or kidneys and uniquely attenuated HPV via a catalase-dependent mechanism. In PASMC, acute hypoxia decreased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within 112±7 seconds, followed, within 205±34 seconds, by increased intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Hypoxia had no effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in renal artery SMC. Hypoxia decreases both cytosolic and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PASMC while increasing cytosolic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in renal artery SMC. Ndufs2 expression was greater in PASMC versus renal artery SMC. Lung Ndufs2 cysteine residues became reduced during acute hypoxia and both hypoxia and reducing agents caused functional inhibition of Complex I. In PASMC, siNdufs2 (cells/tissue treated with Ndufs2 siRNA) decreased normoxic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, prevented hypoxic increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and mimicked aspects of chronic hypoxia, including decreasing Complex I activity, elevating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>) ratio and decreasing expression of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive ion channel, Kv1.5. Knocking down another Fe-S center within Complex I (Ndufs1, NADH [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide] dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 1) or other mitochondrial subunits proposed as putative oxygen sensors (Complex III's Rieske Fe-S center and COX4i2 [cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2] in Complex IV) had no effect on hypoxic increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. In vivo, siNdufs2 significantly decreased hypoxia- and rotenone-induced constriction while enhancing phenylephrine-induced constriction.Ndufs2 is essential for oxygen-sensing and HPV."	"Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic Mdm2."	"We aimed to delineate the pattern of natural course, neuroimaging features, and the genotypic spectrum of cavitating leukoencephalopathies.Children (age of onset ≤16 years) who met the criteria for cavitating leukoencephalopathies from January 2009 to October 2018 were identified. Whole-exome sequencing and prospective follow-up study of the natural history and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed.Thirty-seven children were clinically diagnosed with cavitating leukoencephalopathies. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in eight genes were identified in 31 individuals (83.78%): IBA57 (17/37), NDUFS1 (5/37), NDUFV1 (2/37), NDUFV2 (3/37), NDUFAF5 (1/37), LYRM7 (1/37), NDUFB8 (1/37), and GLRX5 (1/37). All genes were engaged in mitochondrial function. IBA57 was identified in half of children. Mutations in NDUFV2, NDUFAF5, NDUFB8, or GLRX5 were first found to be related to cavitating leukoencephalopathies. Follow-up with a median of 23.5 months (four to 107 months) was available. The median age at disease onset was 11 months. All cases presented acute or subacute onset, and the initial presentation was rapid motor regression in 35 cases. Thirty-five children (35/37) exhibited a stabilized or improved pattern. Cavities and high-intensity diffusion-weighted imaging signals were the common MRI features during the acute stage. Although clinically stable, 21 children had reserved high diffusion-weighted imaging signals for a long time. Patients with different gene mutations show different MRI patterns.The study expands the number of genes involved in cavitating leukoencephalopathies to 22. IBA57 is the most common candidate gene. Most cases showed a stabilized or improved pattern after an acute or subacute onset, which is different from most other inherited metabolic diseases or leukodystrophies. More cases and a longer follow-up period are needed."	"Testicular cancer (TC) represents the most common cancer affecting men within the reproductive age and is often accompanied by major disturbances in semen parameters. Cryopreservation is recommended in these patients before initiating cancer treatment. Currently, there are no studies reporting the molecular mechanisms associated with altered semen quality in these men. The main objective of this study was to compare the sperm proteome of normozoospermic (motility &gt;40%) and asthenozoospermic (motility &lt;40%) TC patients with normozoospermic infertile men without cancer (control group). Pooled sperm samples from normozoospermic (<i>n</i> = 20), asthenozoospermic (<i>n</i> = 11) TC, and a control group (<i>n</i> = 9) were used for quantitative global proteomic profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1085, 846, and 982 proteins were identified in normozoospermic TC, asthenozoospermic TC, and control groups, respectively. Functional analysis revealed mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cellular pathways in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients. Comparison of pathway analysis showed no significant difference in fertility-associated proteins/mechanism between the normozoospermic TC patients and infertile men. Western blot analysis revealed under-expression of NDUFS1 associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and overexpression of CD63 involved in sperm maturation in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients. Our proteomic results confirm that defective cellular pathways are associated with reproductive functions in both normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic TC patients before the start of cancer treatment."	"Patients with non-seminoma testicular cancer (NSTC) cancer can be subfertile or infertile, and present reduced sperm quality, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the sperm proteome of patients with NSTC, who cryopreserved their sperm before starting cancer treatment, with that from healthy fertile men.Semen volume, sperm motility and sperm concentration were evaluated before the cryopreservation of samples from patients with NSTC (n=15) and the control group (n=15). Sperm proteomic analysis was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the two groups were identified using bioinformatic tools.A total of 189 DEPs was identified in the dataset, from which five DEPs related to sperm function and fertilization were selected for validation by Western blot. We were able to validate the underexpression of the mitochondrial complex subunits NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Core Subunit S1 (NDUFS1) and ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase core protein 2 (UQCRC2), as well as the underexpression of the testis-specific sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-4 (ATP1A4) in the NSTC group.Our results indicate that sperm mitochondrial dysfunction may explain the observed decrease in sperm concentration, total sperm count and total motile count in NSTC patients. The identified DEPs may serve as potential biomarkers for the pathophysiology of subfertility/infertility in patients with NSTC. Our study also associates the reduced fertilizing ability of NSTC patients with the dysregulation of important sperm molecular mechanisms."	"The African clawed frogs of the subgenus Silurana comprise both diploid and tetraploid species. The root of the polyploidization event leading to the extant Xenopus calcaratus, X. mellotropicalis, and X. epitropicalis is not fully understood so far. In X. mellotropicalis, we previously proposed 2 evolutionary scenarios encompassing complete (scenario A) or incomplete (scenario B) translocation of a heterochromatic block from chromosome 9 to 2 in a diploid ancestor. To resolve this puzzle, we performed FISH coupled with tyramide signal amplification (FISH-TSA) using 5 X. tropicalis and X. mellotropicalis single copy gene probes (gyg2, cept1, fn1, ndufs1, and sf3b1) reflecting borders of the heterochromatic blocks in X. tropicalis chromosome 9 (XTR 9) and X. mellotropicalis chromosome 9b (XME 9b) and XME 2a. cDNA sequencing recognized both homoeologous genes in X. mellotropicalis. Comparison of gene physical mapping between X. tropicalis and X. mellotropicalis clearly confirmed complete rather than incomplete translocation t(9;2) of the heterochromatic block in the diploid predecessor and thus favored scenario A regarding the formation of an ancestral allotetraploid karyotype."	"Decades of research reveal that MDM2 participates in cellular processes ranging from macro-molecular metabolism to cancer signaling mechanisms. Two recent studies uncovered a new role for MDM2 in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Through the negative regulation of NDUFS1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1) and MT-ND6 (NADH dehydrogenase 6), MDM2 decreases the function and efficiency of Complex I (CI). These observations propose several important questions: (1) Where does MDM2 affect CI activity? (2) What are the cellular consequences of MDM2-mediated regulation of CI? (3) What are the physiological implications of these interactions? Here, we will address these questions and position these observations within the MDM2 literature."	"Unlike stable and immobile cell line conditions, animal hearts contract and relax to pump blood throughout the body. Mitochondria play an essential role by producing biological energy molecules to maintain heart function. In this study, we assessed the effect of heart mimetic cyclic stretch on mitochondria in a cardiac cell line. To mimic the geometric and biomechanical conditions surrounding cells in vivo, cyclic stretching was performed on HL-1 murine cardiomyocytes seeded onto an elastic micropatterned substrate (10% elongation, 0.5 Hz, 4 h/day). Cell viability, semi-quantitative Q-PCR, and western blot analyses were performed in non-stimulated control and cyclic stretch stimulated HL-1 cell lines. Cyclic stretch significantly increased the expression of mitochondria biogenesis-related genes (TUFM, TFAM, ERRα, and PGC1-α) and mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation-related genes (PHB1 and CYTB). Western blot analysis confirmed that cyclic stretch increased protein levels of mitochondria biogenesis-related proteins (TFAM, and ERRα) and oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins (NDUFS1, UQCRC, and PHB1). Consequently, cyclic stretch increased mitochondrial mass and ATP production in treated cells. Our results suggest that cyclic stretch transcriptionally enhanced mitochondria biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation without detrimental effects in a cultured cardiac cell line."	"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a quite common neurodegenerative disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1:800-1,000 in subjects over 60 years old. The aim of our study was to determine the candidate target genes in PD through meta-analysis of multiple gene expression arrays datasets and to further combine mRNA and miRNA expression analyses to identify more convincing biological targets and their regulatory factors. Six included datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database by systematical search, including five mRNA datasets (150 substantia nigra samples in total) and one miRNA dataset containing 32 peripheral blood samples. A chip meta-analysis of five microarray data was conducted by using the metaDE package and 94 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were comprehensively obtained. And 19 deregulated DE miRNAs were obtained through the analysis of one miRNAs dataset by Qlucore Omics Explorer software. An interaction network formed by DE mRNAs, DE miRNAs, and important pathways was discovered after we analyzed the functional enrichment, protein-protein interactions, and miRNA targetome prediction analysis. In conclusion, this study suggested that five significantly downregulated mRNAs (MAPK8, CDC42, NDUFS1, COX4I1, and SDHC) and three significantly downregulated miRNAs (miR-126-5p, miR-19-3p, and miR-29a-3p) were potentially useful diagnostic markers in clinic, and lipid metabolism (especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease pathway) and mitochondrial dysregulation may be the keys to biochemically detectable molecular defects. However, the role of these new biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in PD requires further experiments <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> and further clinical evidence."	"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling or unfolded protein response (UPR) is a common feature of many human diseases, including cancer. Excessive activation of ER stress directly induces cell death, holding a new promising strategy for the therapeutic intervention of cancer. Current ER-stress-inducing agents mainly target UPR components or proteasomes, which exert limited treatment efficacy and undesired side effects due to unselective ER stress and poor tumor-specific distribution. In this study, a unique near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore, IR-34, is synthesized and identified to selectively and efficiently trigger tumoricidal ER stress by targeting the mitochondrial protein NDUFS1. IR-34 is demonstrated to specifically accumulate in living cancer cells for tumor NIR imaging and drastically inhibit tumor growth and recurrence without causing apparent toxicity. Thus, this multifunctional NIR fluorophore may represent a novel theranostic agent for tumor imaging-guided treatment and also strengthens the idea that mitochondria could be a useful target for therapeutic ER stress in cancer cells."	"Cells respond to iron deficiency by activating iron-regulatory proteins to increase cellular iron uptake and availability. However, it is not clear how cells adapt to conditions when cellular iron uptake does not fully match iron demand. Here, we show that the mRNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) is induced by iron deficiency and degrades mRNAs of mitochondrial Fe/S-cluster-containing proteins, specifically <i>Ndufs1</i> in complex I and <i>Uqcrfs1</i> in complex III, to match the decrease in Fe/S-cluster availability. In the absence of TTP, <i>Uqcrfs1</i> levels are not decreased in iron deficiency, resulting in nonfunctional complex III, electron leakage, and oxidative damage. Mice with deletion of <i>Ttp</i> display cardiac dysfunction with iron deficiency, demonstrating that TTP is necessary for maintaining cardiac function in the setting of low cellular iron. Altogether, our results describe a pathway that is activated in iron deficiency to regulate mitochondrial function to match the availability of Fe/S clusters."
"NDUFS4"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Mitochondrial complex I (CI), the first multiprotein enzyme complex of the OXPHOS system, executes a major role in cellular ATP generation. Consequently, dysfunction of this complex has been linked to inherited metabolic disorders, including Leigh disease (LD), an often fatal disease in early life. Development of clinical effective treatments for LD remains challenging due to the complex pathophysiological nature. Treatment with the peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist bezafibrate improved disease phenotype in several mitochondrial disease mouse models mediated via enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation. However, the therapeutic potential of this mixed PPAR (α, δ/β, γ) agonist is severely hampered by hepatotoxicity, which is possibly caused by activation of PPARγ. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of the PPARα-specific fibrate clofibrate in mitochondrial CI-deficient (Ndufs4<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Clofibrate increased lifespan and motor function of Ndufs4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, while only marginal hepatotoxic effects were observed. Due to the complex clinical and cellular phenotype of CI-deficiency, we also aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of clofibrate combined with the redox modulator KH176. As described previously, single treatment with KH176 was beneficial, however, combining clofibrate with KH176 did not result in an additive effect on disease phenotype in Ndufs4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Overall, both drugs have promising, but independent and nonadditive, properties for the pharmacological treatment of CI-deficiency-related mitochondrial diseases."	"To investigate if and how the integrity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) influences susceptibility of <i>Arabidopsis</i> toward <i>Colletotrichum higginsianum</i>, we have selected previously characterized mutants with defects at different stages of the mETC, namely, the complex I mutant <i>ndufs4</i>, the complex II mutant <i>sdh2-1</i>, the complex III mutant <i>ucr8-1</i>, and a mutant of the uncoupling protein <i>ucp1-2</i>. Relative to wild type, the selected complex I, II, and III mutants showed decreased total respiration, increased alternative respiration, as well as increased redox charge of the NADP(H) pool and decreased redox charge of the NAD(H) pool in the dark. In the light, mETC mutants accumulated free amino acids, albeit to varying degrees. Glycine and serine, which are involved in carbon recycling from photorespiration, and N-rich amino acids were predominantly increased in mETC mutants compared to the wild type. Taking together the physiological phenotypes of all examined mutants, our results suggest a connection between the limitation in the re-oxidation of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial matrix and the induction of nitrate assimilation into free amino acids in the cytosol, which seems to be engaged as an additional sink for reducing power. The <i>sdh2-1</i> mutant was less susceptible to <i>C. higginsianum</i> and did not show hampered salicylic acid (SA) accumulation as previously reported for <i>SDH1</i> knock-down plants. The ROS burst remained unaffected in <i>sdh2-1</i>, emonstrating that subunit SDH2 is not involved in the control of ROS production and SA signaling by complex II. Moreover, the <i>ndufs4</i> mutant showed only 20% of <i>C. higginsianum</i> colonization compared to wild type, with the ROS burst and the production of callose papillae being significantly increased compared to wild type. This indicates that a restriction of respiratory metabolism can positively affect pre-penetration resistance of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Taking metabolite profiling data from all investigated mETC mutants, a strong positive correlation of resistance toward <i>C. higginsianum</i> with NADPH pool size, pyruvate contents, and other metabolites associated with redox poise and energy charge was evident, which fosters the hypothesis that limitations in the mETC can support resistance at post-penetration stages by improving the availability of metabolic power."	"Emerging evidence suggest that macrophage and osteoclast are two competing differentiation outcomes from myeloid progenitors. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the polarization of macrophage and osteoclast. These include nuclear receptors/transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), their transcription cofactor PPARγ coactivator 1-β (PGC-1β), metabolic factors such as mitochondrial complex I (CI) component NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase iron-sulfur protein 4 (Ndufs4), as well as transmembrane receptors such as very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). These molecular rheostats promote osteoclast differentiation but suppress proinflammatory macrophage activation and inflammation, by acting lineage-intrinsically, systemically or cross generation. These findings provide new insights to the understanding of the interactions between innate immunity and bone remodeling, advancing the field of osteoimmunology."	"Mitochondrial deficits in energy production cause untreatable and fatal pathologies known as mitochondrial disease (MD). Central nervous system affectation is critical in Leigh Syndrome (LS), a common MD presentation, leading to motor and respiratory deficits, seizures and premature death. However, only specific neuronal populations are affected. Furthermore, their molecular identity and their contribution to the disease remains unknown. Here, using a mouse model of LS lacking the mitochondrial complex I subunit <i>Ndufs4</i>, we dissect the critical role of genetically-defined neuronal populations in LS progression. <i>Ndufs4</i> inactivation in Vglut2-expressing glutamatergic neurons leads to decreased neuronal firing, brainstem inflammation, motor and respiratory deficits, and early death. In contrast, <i>Ndufs4</i> deletion in GABAergic neurons causes basal ganglia inflammation without motor or respiratory involvement, but accompanied by hypothermia and severe epileptic seizures preceding death. These results provide novel insight in the cell type-specific contribution to the pathology, dissecting the underlying cellular mechanisms of MD."	"Leigh syndrome is a devastating mitochondrial disease for which there are no proven therapies. We previously showed that breathing chronic, continuous hypoxia can prevent and even reverse neurological disease in the Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mouse model of complex I (CI) deficiency and Leigh syndrome. Here, we show that genetic activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor transcriptional program via any of four different strategies is insufficient to rescue disease. Rather, we observe an age-dependent decline in whole-body oxygen consumption. These mice exhibit brain tissue hyperoxia, which is normalized by hypoxic breathing. Alternative experimental strategies to reduce oxygen delivery, including breathing carbon monoxide (600 ppm in air) or severe anemia, can reverse neurological disease. Therefore, unused oxygen is the most likely culprit in the pathology of this disease. While pharmacologic activation of the hypoxia response is unlikely to alleviate disease in vivo, interventions that safely normalize brain tissue hyperoxia may hold therapeutic potential."	"Macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype and its subsequent inflammatory response have been implicated in the progression of diabetic complications. Despite adverse consequences of autophagy impairment on macrophage inflammation, the regulation of macrophage autophagy under hyperglycemic conditions is incompletely understood. Here, we report that the autophagy-lysosome system and mitochondrial function are impaired in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose (HG)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and blocks autophagic flux by impairing lysosome function in macrophages under hyperglycemic conditions. Conversely, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS by Mito-TEMPO prevents HG-induced M1 macrophage polarization, and its effect is offset by blocking autophagic flux. The role of mitochondrial ROS in lysosome dysfunction and M1 macrophage polarization is also demonstrated in mitochondrial complex I defective RAW 264.7 cells induced by silencing NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit-S4 (Ndufs4). These findings prove that mitochondrial ROS plays a key role in promoting macrophage polarization to inflammatory phenotype by impairing autophagy-lysosome system, which might provide clue to a novel treatment for diabetic complications."	"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting neonates with devastating sequences. One of the characteristic features for LS is the phenotypic polymorphism, which-in part-can be dedicated to variety of genetic causes. A strong correlation with mitochondrial dysfunction has been assumed as the main cause of LS. This was based on the fact that most genetic causes are related to mitochondrial complex I genome. The first animal LS model was designed based on NDUFS4 knockdown. Interestingly, however, this one or others could not recapitulate the whole spectrum of manifestations encountered in different cases of LS. We show in this chapter a new animal model for LS based on silencing of one gene that is reported previously in clinical cases, FOXRED1. The new model carries some differences from previous models in the fact that more histopathological degeneration in dopaminergic system is seen and more behavioral changes can be recognized. FOXRED1 is an interesting gene that is related to complex I assembly, hence, plays important role in different neurodegenerative disorders leading to different clinical manifestations."	"Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important cause of heritable vision loss. Mutations affecting mitochondrial bioenergetics may lead to isolated vision loss or life-threatening systemic disease, depending on a mutation's severity. Primary optic nerve atrophy resulting from death of retinal ganglion cells is the most prominent ocular manifestation of mitochondrial disease. However, dysfunction of other retinal cell types has also been described, sometimes leading to a loss of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium that manifests clinically as pigmentary retinopathy. A popular mouse model of mitochondrial disease that lacks NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 (NDUFS4), a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, phenocopies many traits of the human disease Leigh syndrome, including the development of optic atrophy. It has also been reported that <i>ndufs4</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice display diminished light responses at the level of photoreceptors or bipolar cells. By conducting electroretinography (ERG) recordings in live <i>ndufs4</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we now demonstrate that this defect occurs at the level of retinal photoreceptors. We found that this deficit does not arise from retinal developmental anomalies, photoreceptor degeneration, or impaired regeneration of visual pigment. Strikingly, the impairment of <i>ndufs4</i><sup>-/-</sup> photoreceptor function was not observed in <i>ex vivo</i> ERG recordings from isolated retinas, indicating that photoreceptors with complex I deficiency are intrinsically capable of normal signaling. The difference in electrophysiological phenotypes <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> suggests that the energy deprivation associated with severe mitochondrial impairment in the outer retina renders <i>ndufs4</i><sup>-/-</sup> photoreceptors unable to maintain the homeostatic conditions required to operate at their normal capacity."	"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is composed of large membrane-bound compartments, and its membrane subdomain appears to be in close contact with mitochondria via ER-mitochondria contact sites. Here, I demonstrate that the ER membrane protein, BAP31, acts as a key factor in mitochondrial homeostasis to stimulate the constitution of the mitochondrial complex I by forming an ER-mitochondria bridging protein complex. Within this complex, BAP31 interacts with mitochondria-localized proteins, including Tom40, to stimulate the translocation of NDUFS4, the component of complex I from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Disruption of the BAP31-Tom40 complex inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity and oxygen consumption by the decreased NDUFS4 localization to the mitochondria. Thus, the BAP31-Tom40 ER-mitochondria bridging complex mediates the regulation of mitochondrial function and plays a role as a previously unidentified stress sensor, representing a mechanism for the establishment of ER-mitochondria communication via contact sites between these organelles."	"<b>A</b><b>bstract:</b> Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and a concomitant increase in glycolytic flux. We investigated the expression of OXPHOS complex subunits and mitochondrial mass in 34 human cholangiocellular carcinomas (CCCs) and adjacent normal tissue by using tissue microarrays. In the tumor periphery, all OXPHOS complexes were reduced except complex I. In addition, significantly lower levels of complex IV were found at the tumor center (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Mitochondrial mass, as indicated by VDAC1 expression, was significantly increased in CCCs compared to corresponding normal tissue (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). VDAC1 levels were inversely correlated with UICC (Union Internationale Contre le Cancer) cancer stage classification (<i>p</i> = 0.0065). Furthermore, significantly lower VDAC1 was present in patients with lymph node involvement (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Consistent with this, patients whose carcinomas expressed VDAC1 at low to moderate levels had significantly reduced survival compared to high expressors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, low mitochondrial mass is associated with more aggressive CCC. These metabolic features are indicative of a Warburg phenotype in CCCs. This metabolic signature has potential therapeutic implications because tumors with low mitochondrial function may be targeted by metabolic therapies such as a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet."	"<b>Rationale</b>: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration is extremely hard to repair or regenerate and is often coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based treatment has been demonstrated beneficial for RGC against degeneration. However, underlying mechanisms of MSC-provided RGC protection are largely unknown other than neuroprotective paracrine actions. In this study, we sought to investigate whether mitochondrial donation from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSC (iPSC-MSCs) could preserve RGC survival and restore retinal function. <b>Methods</b>: iPSC-MSCs were injected into the vitreous cavity of one eye in NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 4 (<i>Ndufs4</i>) knockout (KO) and wild type mice. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or rotenone treated iPSC-MSCs were injected as control groups. Retinal function was detected by flash electroretinogram (ERG). Whole-mount immunofluorescence (IF), morphometric analysis, confocal microscopy imaging, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the retinas were conducted to investigate mitochondrial transfer from human iPSC-MSCs to mouse retina. Quantitative mouse cytokine arrays were carried out to measure retinal inflammatory response under difference treatments. <b>Results</b>: RGC survival in the iPSC-MSC injected retina of <i>Ndufs4</i> KO mice was significantly increased with improved retinal function. GFP labelled human mitochondria from iPSC-MSC were detected in the RGCs in the retina of <i>Ndufs4</i> KO mice starting from 96 hours post injection. PCR result showed only human mitochondrial DNA without human nuclear DNA could be detected in the mouse retinas after iPSC-MSC treatment in <i>Ndufs4</i> KO mice eye. Quantitative cytokine array analysis showed pro-inflammatory cytokines was also downregulated by this iPSC-MSC treatment. <b>Conclusion</b>: Intravitreal transplanted iPSC-MSCs can effectively donate functional mitochondria to RGCs and protect against mitochondrial damage-induced RGC loss."	"Parkinson disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder associated with misfolded SNCA/α-synuclein accumulation in brain. Impaired catabolism of SNCA potentiates formation of its toxic oligomers. <i>LRRK2</i> (leucine-rich repeat kinase-2) mutations predispose to familial and sporadic PD. Mutant LRRK2 perturbs chaperone-mediated-autophagy (CMA) to degrade SNCA. We showed greater age-dependent accumulation of oligomeric SNCA in striatum and cortex of aged LRRK2<sup>R1441G</sup> knockin (KI) mice, compared to age-matched wildtype (WT) by 53% and 31%, respectively. Lysosomal clustering and accumulation of CMA-specific LAMP2A and HSPA8/HSC70 proteins were observed in aged mutant striatum along with increased GAPDH (CMA substrate) by immunohistochemistry of dorsal striatum and flow cytometry of ventral midbrain cells. Using our new reporter protein clearance assay, mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing either SNCA or CMA recognition 'KFERQ'-like motif conjugated with photoactivated-PAmCherry showed slower cellular clearance compared to WT by 28% and 34%, respectively. However, such difference was not observed after the 'KFERQ'-motif was mutated. LRRK2 mutant MEFs exhibited lower lysosomal degradation than WT indicating lysosomal dysfunction. LAMP2A-knockdown reduced total lysosomal activity and clearance of 'KFERQ'-substrate in WT but not in mutant MEFs, indicating impaired CMA in the latter. A CMA-specific activator, AR7, induced neuronal LAMP2A transcription and lysosomal activity in MEFs. AR7 also attenuated the progressive accumulation of both intracellular and extracellular SNCA oligomers in prolonged cultures of mutant cortical neurons (DIV21), indicating that oligomer accumulation can be suppressed by CMA activation. Activation of autophagic pathways to reduce aged-related accumulation of pathogenic SNCA oligomers is a viable disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for PD.<b>Abbreviations:</b> 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; AR7: 7-chloro-3-(4-methylphenyl)-2H-1,4-benzoxazine; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CQ: chloroquine; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; DDM: n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside; DIV: days in vitro; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GWAS: genome-wide association studies; HSPA8/HSC70: heat shock protein 8; KFERQ: CMA recognition pentapeptide; KI: knockin; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2A: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LRRK2: leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; NDUFS4: NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S4; NE: novel epitope; PD: Parkinson disease; RARA/RARα: retinoic acid receptor, alpha; SNCA: synuclein, alpha; TUBB3/TUJ1: tubulin, beta 3 class III; WT: wild-type."	"Mitochondrial diseases are a group of rare life-threatening diseases often caused by defects in the oxidative phosphorylation system. No effective treatment is available for these disorders.

Alternative models of the pathology are essential to better understand mitochondrial diseases and to accelerate the development of new therapeutics. The fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a cost- and time-efficient model that can recapitulate a wide range of phenotypes observed in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders.

Using two ubiquitous driver lines at two temperatures, we established a collection of phenotypes relevant to complex I deficiencies. Our data offer models and phenotypes with different levels of severity that can be used for future therapeutic screenings. These include qualitative phenotypes that are amenable to high-throughput drug screening and quantitative phenotypes that require more resources but are likely to have increased potential and sensitivity to show modulation by drug treatment."	"Mitochondria are key organelles for cellular metabolism, and regulate several processes including cell death and macroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we show that mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) deficiency deactivates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, a key regulator of energy homeostasis) signaling in tissue and in cultured cells. The deactivation of AMPK in RC-deficiency is due to increased expression of the AMPK-inhibiting protein FLCN (folliculin). AMPK is found to be necessary for basal lysosomal function, and AMPK deactivation in RC-deficiency inhibits lysosomal function by decreasing the activity of the lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel MCOLN1 (mucolipin 1). MCOLN1 is regulated by phosphoinositide kinase PIKFYVE and its product PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which is also decreased in RC-deficiency. Notably, reactivation of AMPK, in a PIKFYVE-dependent manner, or of MCOLN1 in RC-deficient cells, restores lysosomal hydrolytic capacity. Building on these data and the literature, we propose that downregulation of the AMPK-PIKFYVE-PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-MCOLN1 pathway causes lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and impaired lysosomal catabolism. Besides unveiling a novel role of AMPK in lysosomal function, this study points to the mechanism that links mitochondrial malfunction to impaired lysosomal catabolism, underscoring the importance of AMPK and the complexity of organelle cross-talk in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. <b>Abbreviation</b>: ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>: mitochondrial transmembrane potential; AMP: adenosine monophosphate; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ATP6V0A1: ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal, V0 subbunit A1; ATP6V1A: ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal, V0 subbunit A; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CREB1: cAMP response element binding protein 1; CTSD: cathepsin D; CTSF: cathepsin F; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; EBSS: Earl's balanced salt solution; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FCCP: carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenolhydrazone; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GPN: glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MCOLN1/TRPML1: mucolipin 1; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; MITF: melanocyte inducing transcription factor; ML1N*2-GFP: probe used to detect PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> based on the transmembrane domain of MCOLN1; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; NDUFS4: NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; pcDNA: plasmid cytomegalovirus promoter DNA; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>: phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate; PIKFYVE: phosphoinositide kinase, FYVE-type zinc finger containing; P/S: penicillin-streptomycin; PVDF: polyvinylidene fluoride; qPCR: quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RNA: ribonucleic acid; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TFE3: transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3; TMRM: tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; ULK2: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2; UQCRC1: ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1; v-ATPase: vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase; WT: wild-type."	"The analysis of limited-quantity samples remains a challenge associated with mouse models, especially for multi-platform metabolomics studies. Although inherently insensitive, the highly specific characteristics of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy make it an advantageous platform for global metabolite profiling, particularly in mitochondrial disease research.Show method equivalency between a well-established standard operating protocol (SOP) and our novel miniaturized <sup>1</sup>H-NMR method.The miniaturized method was performed in a 2 mm NMR tube on a standard 500 MHz NMR spectrometer with a 5 mm triple-resonance inverse TXI probe at room temperature.Firstly, using synthetic urine spiked with low (50 µM), medium (250 µM) and high (500 µM) levels (n = 10) of nine standards, both the SOP and miniaturized method were shown to have acceptable precision (CV &lt; 15%), relative accuracy (80-120%), and linearity (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.95), except for taurine. Furthermore, statistical equivalence was shown using the two one-sided test. Secondly, pooled mouse quadriceps muscle extract was used to further confirm method equivalence (n = 3), as well as explore the analytical dynamics of this novel approach by analyzing more-concentrated versions of samples (up to 10× concentration) to expand identification of metabolites qualitatively, with quantitative linearity. Lastly, we demonstrate the new technique's application in a pilot metabolomics study using minute soleus muscle tissue from a mouse model of Leigh syndrome using Ndufs4 KO mice.We demonstrate method equivalency, supporting our novel miniaturized <sup>1</sup>H-NMR method as a financially feasible alternative to cryoprobe technology-for limited-quantity biological samples in metabolomics studies that requires a volume one-tenth of the SOP."	"Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial disease characterized by neurological disorders, metabolic abnormality and premature death. There is no cure for Leigh syndrome; therefore, new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. In Ndufs4-KO mice, a mouse model of Leigh syndrome, we found that Complex I deficiency led to declines in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and NAD<sup>+</sup> redox imbalance. We tested the hypothesis that elevation of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels would benefit Ndufs4-KO mice. Administration of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) extended lifespan of Ndufs4-KO mice and attenuated lactic acidosis. NMN increased lifespan by normalizing NAD<sup>+</sup> redox imbalance and lowering HIF1a accumulation in Ndufs4-KO skeletal muscle without affecting the brain. NMN up-regulated alpha-ketoglutarate (KG) levels in Ndufs4-KO muscle, a metabolite essential for HIF1a degradation. To test whether supplementation of KG can treat Ndufs4-KO mice, a cell-permeable KG, dimethyl ketoglutarate (DMKG) was administered. DMKG extended lifespan of Ndufs4-KO mice and delayed onset of neurological phenotype. This study identified therapeutic mechanisms that can be targeted pharmacologically to treat Leigh syndrome."	"Maladaptive remodeling in pressure overload (PO)-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may lead to heart failure. Major sex differences have been reported in this process. The steroid hormone 17β-estradiol, along with its receptors ERα and ERβ, is thought to be crucial for sex differences and is expected to be protective, but this may not hold true for males. Increasing evidence demonstrates a major role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in PO-induced LVH. However, little is known about the effects of biological sex and ERβ on cardiac miRNA regulation and downstream mitochondrial targets. We aimed at the analysis of proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism testing the hypothesis that they are the target of sex-specific miRNA regulation.We employed the transverse aortic constriction model in mice and assessed the levels of five mitochondrial proteins, i.e., Auh, Crat, Decr1, Hadha, and Ndufs4.We found a significant decrease of the mitochondrial proteins primarily in the male overloaded heart compared with the corresponding control group. Following computational analysis to identify miRNAs putatively targeting these proteins, our in vitro experiments employing miRNA mimics demonstrated the presence of functional target sites for miRNAs in the 3'-untranslated region of the messenger RNAs coding for these proteins. Next, we assessed the levels of the functionally validated miRNAs under PO and found that their expression was induced only in the male overloaded heart. In contrast, there was no significant effect on miRNA expression in male mice with deficient ERβ.We put forward that the male-specific induction of miRNAs and corresponding downregulation of downstream protein targets involved in mitochondrial metabolism may contribute to sex-specific remodeling in PO-induced LVH."	"In mice, restriction of loss of the mitochondrial complex I gene Ndufs4 to glutamatergic neurons confers a profound hypersensitivity to volatile anesthetics.Astrocytes are crucial to glutamatergic synapse functioning during excitatory transmission.In a tamoxifen-activated astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mouse, the induction EC50s for tail clamp in both isoflurane and halothane were similar between the control and astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice at 3 weeks after 4-hydroxy tamoxifen injection. However, the emergent concentrations in both anesthetics for the astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice were half that of the controls.Similarly, the induction EC50s for loss of righting reflex were similar between the control and astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice; concentrations for regain of righting reflex in both anesthetics for the astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice were much less than the control.Thus, mitochondrial complex I function within astrocytes is essential for normal emergence from anesthesia.In mice, restriction of loss of the mitochondrial complex I gene Ndufs4 to glutamatergic neurons confers a profound hypersensitivity to volatile anesthetics similar to that seen with global genetic knockout of Ndufs4. Astrocytes are crucial to glutamatergic synapse functioning during excitatory transmission. Therefore, the authors examined the role of astrocytes in the anesthetic hypersensitivity of Ndufs4(KO).A tamoxifen-activated astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mouse was constructed. The specificity of the astrocyte-specific inducible model was confirmed by using the green fluorescent protein reporter line Ai6. Approximately 120 astrocyte-specific knockout and control mice were used for the experiments. Mice were anesthetized with varying concentrations of isoflurane or halothane; loss of righting reflex and response to a tail clamp were determined and quantified as the induction and emergence EC50s. Because norepinephrine has been implicated in emergence from anesthesia and astrocytes respond to norepinephrine to release gliotransmitters, the authors measured norepinephrine levels in the brains of control and knockout Ndufs4 animals.The induction EC50s for tail clamp in both isoflurane and halothane were similar between the control and astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice at 3 weeks after 4-hydroxy tamoxifen injection (induction concentration, EC50(ind)-isoflurane: control = 1.27 ± 0.12, astrocyte-specific knockout = 1.21 ± 0.18, P = 0.495; halothane: control = 1.28 ± 0.05, astrocyte-specific knockout = 1.20 ± 0.05, P = 0.017). However, the emergent concentrations in both anesthetics for the astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice were less than the controls for tail clamp; (emergence concentration, EC50(em)-isoflurane: control = 1.18 ± 0.10, astrocyte-specific knockout = 0.67 ± 0.11, P &lt; 0.0001; halothane: control = 1.08 ± 0.09, astrocyte-specific knockout = 0.59 ± 0.12, P &lt; 0.0001). The induction EC50s for loss of righting reflex were also similar between the control and astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice (EC50(ind)-isoflurane: control = 1.02 ± 0.10, astrocyte-specific knockout = 0.97 ± 0.06, P = 0.264; halothane: control = 1.03 ± 0.05, astrocyte-specific knockout = 0.99 ± 0.08, P = 0.207). The emergent concentrations for loss of righting reflex in both anesthetics for the astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice were less than the control (EC50(em)-isoflurane: control = 1.0 ± 0.07, astrocyte-specific knockout = 0.62 ± 0.12, P &lt; 0.0001; halothane: control = 1.0 ± 0.04, astrocyte-specific KO = 0.64 ± 0.09, P &lt; 0.0001); N ≥ 6 for control and astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice. For all tests, similar results were seen at 7 weeks after 4-hydroxy tamoxifen injection. The total norepinephrine content of the brain in global or astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice was unchanged compared to control mice.The only phenotype of the astrocyte-specific Ndufs4(KO) mouse was a specific impairment in emergence from volatile anesthetic-induced general anesthesia. The authors conclude that normal mitochondrial function within astrocytes is essential for emergence from anesthesia."	NA	NA
"NDUFV1"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Leigh syndrome (LS), the most common childhood mitochondrial disorder, has characteristic clinical and neuroradiologic features. Mutations in more than 75 genes have been identified in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genome, implicating a high degree of genetic heterogeneity in LS. To profile these genetic signatures and understand the pathophysiology of LS, we recruited 64 patients from 62 families who were clinically diagnosed with LS at Seoul National University Children's Hospital. Mitochondrial genetic analysis followed by whole-exome sequencing was performed on 61 patients. Pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA were identified in 18 families and nuclear DNA mutations in 22. The following 17 genes analyzed in 40 families were found to have genetic complexity: MTATP6, MTND1, MTND3, MTND5, MTND6, MTTK, NDUFS1, NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, SURF1, SLC19A3, ECHS1, PNPT1, IARS2, NARS2, VPS13D, and NAXE. Two treatable cases had biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease, and another three were identified as having defects in the newly recognized genes (VPS13D or NAXE). Variants in the nuclear genes that encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases were present in 27.3% of cases. Our findings expand the genetic and clinical spectrum of LS, showing genetic heterogeneity and highlighting treatable cases and those with novel genetic causes."	"High-throughput drug discovery is highly dependent on the targets available to accelerate the process of candidates screening. Traditional chemical proteomics approaches for the screening of drug targets usually require the immobilization/modification of the drug molecules to pull down the interacting proteins. Recently, energetics-based proteomics methods provide an alternative way to study drug-protein interaction by using complex cell lysate directly without any modification of the drugs. In this study, we developed a novel energetics-based proteomics strategy, the solvent-induced protein precipitation (SIP) approach, to profile the interaction of drugs with their target proteins by using quantitative proteomics. The method is easy to use for any laboratory with the common chemical reagents of acetone, ethanol, and acetic acid. The SIP approach was able to identify the well-known protein targets of methotrexate, SNS-032, and a pan-kinase inhibitor of staurosporine in cell lysate. We further applied this approach to discover the off-targets of geldanamycin. Three known protein targets of the HSP90 family were successfully identified, and several potential off-targets including NADH dehydrogenase subunits NDUFV1 and NDUFAB1 were identified for the first time, and the NDUFV1 was validated by using Western blotting. In addition, this approach was capable of evaluating the affinity of the drug-target interaction. The data collectively proved that our approach provides a powerful platform for drug target discovery."	"We report on a female patient who presented with severe intellectual disability and autistic behavior, dysmorphic features, orodental anomalies, and bilateral calcification of basal ganglia. Using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray, we have identified a de novo duplication of 11q13.1q22.1 involving the dosage sensitive genes FGF3 and FGF4, genes related to autosomal dominant disorders KMT5B, GAL, SPTBN2, and LRP5, susceptibility loci SCZD2, SLEH1, and SHANK2, mitochondrial genes NDUFV1, NDUFS8, and TMEM126B, and many loss of function genes, including PHOX2A, CLPB, MED17, B3GNT1, LIPT2, and CLPB. However, the duplication did not involve Ribonuclease H2, subunit C (RNASEH2C) which is considered to be located in the critical region for Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. In combination with the duplication at 11q13.1, a 1.849-Mb heterozygous duplication at 4q35.2 was also identified. Although this duplicated region does not contain causative genes related to brain calcification, the duplication at 4q35 was reported previously in a patient with basal ganglia calcification, coats' like retinopathy, and glomerulosclerosis. Our patient's presentation and genomic findings indicate that duplication of 4q35.2 could be a novel genetic cause of calcification of basal ganglia. Our report also underscores the clinical significance of rearrangements in 11q13.1q22.1 in the pathogenesis of basal ganglia calcification."	"Analysis of human muscle diseases highlights the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle. Our previous work revealed that diverse upstream events correlated with altered mitochondrial proteome in human muscle biopsies. However, several proteins showed relatively unchanged expression suggesting that post-translational modifications, mainly protein phosphorylation could influence their activity and regulate mitochondrial processes. We conducted mitochondrial phosphoprotein profiling, by proteomics approach, of healthy human skeletal muscle (n = 10) and three muscle diseases (n = 10 each): Dysferlinopathy, Polymyositis and Distal Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles. Healthy human muscle mitochondrial proteins displayed 253 phosphorylation sites (phosphosites), which contributed to metabolic and redox processes and mitochondrial organization etc. Electron transport chain complexes accounted for 84 phosphosites. Muscle pathologies displayed 33 hyperphosphorylated and 14 hypophorphorylated sites with only 5 common proteins, indicating varied phosphorylation profile across muscle pathologies. Molecular modelling revealed altered local structure in the phosphorylated sites of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 and complex V subunit ATP5B1. Molecular dynamics simulations in complex I subunits NDUFV1, NDUFS1 and NDUFV2 revealed that phosphorylation induced structural alterations thereby influencing electron transfer and potentially altering enzyme activity. We propose that altered phosphorylation at specific sites could regulate mitochondrial protein function in the skeletal muscle during physiological and pathological processes."	"The histology-based Gleason score (GS) of prostate cancer (PCa) tissue biopsy is the most accurate predictor of disease aggressiveness and an important measure to guide treatment strategies and patient management. The variability associated with PCa tumor sampling and the subjective determination of the GS are challenges that limit accurate diagnostication and prognostication. Thus, novel molecular signatures are needed to distinguish between indolent and aggressive forms of PCa for better patient management and outcomes. Herein, label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics is used to profile the proteome of 50 PCa tissues spanning five grade groups (n = 10 per group) relative to tissues from individuals with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Over 2000 proteins are identified albeit at different levels between and within the patient groups, revealing biological processes associated with specific grades. A panel of 11 prostate-derived proteins including IGKV3D-20, RNASET2, TACC2, ANXA7, LMOD1, PRCP, GYG1, NDUFV1, H1FX, APOBEC3C, and CTSZ display the potential to stratify patients from low and high PCa grade groups. Parallel reaction monitoring of the same sample cohort validate the differential expression of LMOD1, GYG1, IGKV3D-20, and RNASET2. The four proteins associated with low and high PCa grades reported here warrant further exploration as candidate biomarkers for PCa aggressiveness."	"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The study of blood-based biomarkers has lasted for a long time in AD, because it supports the concept that peripheral changes are involved in AD pathology. But it is still unclear how peripheral blood is involved in the temporal characteristic molecular mechanisms of AD from aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and which cells are responsible for the molecular mechanisms. The main purpose of our study is to gain a systematic and comprehensive understanding of temporal characteristic networks of peripheral blood in AD using whole blood samples with 329 case-control samples, including 104 normal elderly control subjects (CTL), 80 MCI who are susceptible to AD, and 145 AD, by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The module-trait relationships were constructed and module preservation was validated with independent datasets GSE63061, GSE97760, GSE18309, GSE29378, GSE28146, and GSE29652. Our results indicate that the down-regulated protein modification and ubiquitin degradation systems, and the up-regulated insulin resistance both play a major role in MCI, while the up-regulated inflammatory cascade dominates in AD, which is mainly mediated by monocytes, macrophages. Although there is mixed activation of M1 and M2 macrophages in all stages of AD, the immune neutral state or M2 polarization may predominate in MCI, and M1 polarization may predominate in AD. Moreover, we found that TRPV2, NDUFV1, ATF4, HSPA8, STAT3 and LUC7L3 may mediate the pathological changes in MCI, while SIRPA, LAMP-2, NDUFB5, HSPA8, STAT3 and FPR2 may mediate the conversion from MCI-AD or the pathological changes in AD, which provide a basis for the treatment based on the peripheral blood system. In addition, we also found that the combined diagnosis based on a panel of genes from the red, blue, and brown modules have a moderate diagnostic effect on distinguishing MCI and AD from CTL, suggesting that those panels of genes may be used for detection of MCI and prediction of this conversion from MCI to AD. Our research emphasizes that pathological changes, based on temporal characteristics of peripheral blood, provide a theoretical basis for targeted peripheral treatment based on appropriate times and identified several diagnostic markers."

"We aimed to delineate the pattern of natural course, neuroimaging features, and the genotypic spectrum of cavitating leukoencephalopathies.Children (age of onset ≤16 years) who met the criteria for cavitating leukoencephalopathies from January 2009 to October 2018 were identified. Whole-exome sequencing and prospective follow-up study of the natural history and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed.Thirty-seven children were clinically diagnosed with cavitating leukoencephalopathies. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in eight genes were identified in 31 individuals (83.78%): IBA57 (17/37), NDUFS1 (5/37), NDUFV1 (2/37), NDUFV2 (3/37), NDUFAF5 (1/37), LYRM7 (1/37), NDUFB8 (1/37), and GLRX5 (1/37). All genes were engaged in mitochondrial function. IBA57 was identified in half of children. Mutations in NDUFV2, NDUFAF5, NDUFB8, or GLRX5 were first found to be related to cavitating leukoencephalopathies. Follow-up with a median of 23.5 months (four to 107 months) was available. The median age at disease onset was 11 months. All cases presented acute or subacute onset, and the initial presentation was rapid motor regression in 35 cases. Thirty-five children (35/37) exhibited a stabilized or improved pattern. Cavities and high-intensity diffusion-weighted imaging signals were the common MRI features during the acute stage. Although clinically stable, 21 children had reserved high diffusion-weighted imaging signals for a long time. Patients with different gene mutations show different MRI patterns.The study expands the number of genes involved in cavitating leukoencephalopathies to 22. IBA57 is the most common candidate gene. Most cases showed a stabilized or improved pattern after an acute or subacute onset, which is different from most other inherited metabolic diseases or leukodystrophies. More cases and a longer follow-up period are needed."	"Wilms tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common pediatric renal malignancy. Its diagnosis is principally based on histology. Several genetic loci have been shown to be associated with Wilms tumor formation, including WT1, WT2, FWT1, FWT2, CTNNB1, WTX, and TP53. Other loci, such as 1p, 2q, 7p, 9q, 12q, 14q, 16q, 17p, and 22, have also been implicated in the etiology of Wilms tumor. The aim of this study is to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of this tumor. In the present study, we analyzed the histological appearance and copy number aberrations using array comparative genomic hybridization of six Wilms tumors without somatic mutation in the WT1 gene. Many chromosomal aberrations on array comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed that the genetics of Wilms tumors are extremely complex. Amplifications and deletions of large DNA fragments were observed in some samples. Amplifications of NDUFV1, ZIC2, SIX1, NR2F2, MIR1469, SOX9, JAG1, MIR6870, and GNAS were found in all six Wilms tumors. Moreover, amplifications of five genes were identified in the Wilms tumors of stromal type and amplifications of at least 10 genes were identified in the Wilms tumors of epithelial type. Our results indicated that amplifications of nine genes are the essential events in the tumorigenesis of Wilms tumor, which may inform its clinical and therapeutic management. In addition, mixed type Wilms tumor may be the heterogeneous group able to be classified using genetic results of epithelial and stromal components based on immunohistochemistry."	"Cell models of mitochondrial complex I (CI) deficiency display activation of glycolysis to compensate for the loss in mitochondrial ATP production. This adaptation can mask other relevant deficiency-induced aberrations in cell physiology. Here we investigated the viability, mitochondrial morphofunction, ROS levels and ATP homeostasis of primary skin fibroblasts from Leigh Syndrome (LS) patients with isolated CI deficiency. These cell lines harbored mutations in nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded CI genes (NDUFS7, NDUFS8, NDUFV1) and, to prevent glycolysis upregulation, were cultured in a pyruvate-free medium in which glucose was replaced by galactose. Following optimization of the cell culture protocol, LS fibroblasts died in the galactose medium, whereas control cells did not. LS cell death was dose-dependently inhibited by pyruvate, malate, oxaloacetate, α-ketoglutarate, aspartate, and exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> (eNAD), but not by lactate, succinate, α-ketobutyrate, and uridine. Pyruvate and eNAD increased the cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> content in galactose-treated LS cells to a different extent and co-incubation studies revealed that pyruvate-induced rescue was not primarily mediated by NAD<sup>+</sup>. Functionally, in LS cells glucose-by-galactose replacement increased mitochondrial fragmentation and mass, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ), increased H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA-oxidizing ROS levels, increased mitochondrial ATP generation, and reduced the total cellular ATP content. These aberrations were differentially rescued by pyruvate and eNAD, supporting the conclusion that these compounds rescue galactose-induced LS cell death via different mechanisms. These findings establish a cell-based strategy for intervention testing and enhance our understanding of CI deficiency pathophysiology."	"Tumor hypoxia reduces the effectiveness of radiation therapy by limiting the biologically effective dose. An acute increase in tumor oxygenation before radiation treatment should therefore significantly improve the tumor cell kill after radiation. Efforts to increase oxygen delivery to the tumor have not shown positive clinical results. Here we show that targeting mitochondrial respiration results in a significant reduction of the tumor cells' demand for oxygen, leading to increased tumor oxygenation and radiation response. We identified an activity of the FDA-approved drug papaverine as an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I. We also provide genetic evidence that papaverine's complex I inhibition is directly responsible for increased oxygenation and enhanced radiation response. Furthermore, we describe derivatives of papaverine that have the potential to become clinical radiosensitizers with potentially fewer side effects. Importantly, this radiosensitizing strategy will not sensitize well-oxygenated normal tissue, thereby increasing the therapeutic index of radiotherapy."	""	"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by either mitochondrial or nuclear DNA mutations resulting in dysfunctional mitochondrial energy metabolism. The onset of clinical features is typically between 3 and 12 months of age; however, a later onset has been described in a few patients. Complex I deficiency is reported to be the most common cause of mitochondrial disorders. We described a patient with a late-onset LS, who presented with gait ataxia, caused by complex I deficiency (NDUFV1 gene)."	"Medical genomics research performed in diverse population facilitates a better understanding of the genetic basis of developmental disorders, with regional implications for community genetics. Autosomal recessive mitochondrial complex I deficiency (MCID) accounts for a constellation of clinical features, including encephalopathies, myopathies, and Leigh Syndrome. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified biallelic missense variants in NDUFV1 that encodes the 51-kD subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) NDUFV1. Mapping the variants on published crystal structures of mitochondrial complex I demonstrate that the novel c.1118T &gt; C (p.(Phe373Ser)) variant is predicted to diminish the affinity of the active pocket of NDUFV1 for FMN that correlates to an early onset of debilitating MCID symptoms. The c.1156C &gt; T (p.(Arg386Cys)) variant is predicted to alter electron shuttling required for energy production and correlate to a disease onset in childhood. NDUFV1 c.1156C &gt; T (p.(Arg386Cys)) represents a founder variant in South Asian populations that have value in prioritizing this variant in a population-specific manner for genetic diagnostic evaluation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the advantage of analyzing population-specific sequences to understand the disease pathophysiology and prevalence of inherited risk variants in the underrepresented populations."	"Complex I deficiency is one of the most common mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. This deficiency of oxidative phosphorylation results from mutation in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Mutations in NDUFV1 (Flavin binding subunit of Respiratory complex 1) results in neurological manifestations including Leigh syndrome and leucoencephalopathy. The authors report a one-year-old boy with history of regression of motor milestones following a trivial fall from the bed. His magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse, cystic leucoencephalopathy involving corpus callosum and periventricular white matter. Clinical features and radiological findings may resemble those of vanishing white matter disease. Next generation sequencing revealed likely compound heterozygous missense pathogenic variant in exon 8 of NDUFV1 gene [c.1156C &gt; C/T (p.Arg386Cys)] and possibly novel splice site variation in intron 2 of NDUFV1 gene (c.155 + 1G &gt; G/A). NDUFV1 related leucoencephalopathy must be considered among those presenting with sudden onset of motor regression with neuroimaging correlate of diffuse cystic leucodystrophy."	"Early-onset preeclampsia (EOS-PE) refers to preeclampsia that occurred before 34 gestation weeks. This study is conducted to explore the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of EOS-PE using proteomic strategy.To identify altering expressed mitochondrial proteins between severe EOS-PE and healthy pregnancies, enrichment of mitochondria coupled with iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic method is performed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot are performed to detect the alteration of changing expression proteins, and confirmed the accuracy of proteomic results.A total of 1372 proteins were quantified and 132 altering expressed proteins were screened, including 86 downregulated expression proteins and 46 upregulated expression proteins (p &lt; 0.05). Bioinformatics analysis showed that differentially expressed proteins participated in numerous biological processes, including oxidation-reduction process, respiratory electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. Especially, mitochondria-related molecules, PRDX2, PARK7, BNIP3, BCL2, PDHA1, SUCLG1, ACADM, and NDUFV1, are involved in energy-production process in the matrix and membrane of mitochondria.Results of the experiment show that abnormal electron transport, excessive oxidative stress, and mitochondrion disassembly might be the main cause of mitochondrial dysfunction, and is related to the pathogenesis of EOS-PE."	"We demonstrate that a heterozygous nuclear variant in the gene encoding mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFV1 aggravates the cellular phenotype in the presence of a mitochondrial DNA variant in complex I subunit ND1. Our findings suggest that heterozygous variants could be more significant in inherited mitochondrial diseases than hitherto assumed."	"There is emerging evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of acquired demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, some of the primary mitochondrial disorders such as mitochondrial leukoencephalopathies exhibit evidence of neuroinflammation on MRI. The inter-relationship between mitochondrial disorders and episodic CNS inflammation needs exploration because of the therapeutic implications.We sought to analyze the clinical course and MRI characteristics in a cohort of patients with mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy to determine features, if any, that mimic primary demyelinating disorders. Therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed.Detailed analysis of the clinical course, magnetic resonance imaging findings and therapeutic response was performed in 14 patients with mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy. The diagnosis was ascertained by clinical features, histopathology, respiratory chain enzyme assays and exome sequencing.Fourteen patients [Age at evaluation: 2-7 yrs, M: F-1:1] were included in the study. The genetic findings included variations in NDUFA1 (1); NDUFV1 (4); NDUFS2 (2); LYRM (2);MPV17(1); BOLA3(2); IBA57(2). Clinical Features which mimicked acquired demyelinating disorder included acute onset focal deficits associated with encephalopathy [10/14, 71%], febrile illness preceding the onset [7/14, 50%] unequivocal partial or complete steroid responsiveness [11/11], episodic/ relapsing remitting neurological dysfunction [10/14, 71%] and a subsequent stable rather than a progressive course [12/14, 85%]. MRI characteristics included confluent white matter lesions [14/14, 100%], diffusion restriction [11/14,78.5%], contrast enhancement [13/13,100%], spinal cord involvement [8/13,61.5%], lactate peak on MRS [13/13] and white matter cysts [13/14, 92.8%].Clinical presentations of mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy often mimic an acquired demyelinating disorder. The therapeutic implications of these observations require further exploration."	NA	NA
"SCO2"	"Leigh syndrome"	"The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, contains heme and copper centers for electron transfer. The conserved COX2 subunit contains the Cu<sub>A</sub> site, a binuclear copper center. The copper chaperones SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, are required for Cu<sub>A</sub> center formation. Loss of function of these chaperones and the concomitant cytochrome c oxidase deficiency cause severe human disorders. Here we analyzed the molecular function of COA6 and the consequences of COA6 deficiency for mitochondria. Our analyses show that loss of COA6 causes combined complex I and complex IV deficiency and impacts membrane potential-driven protein transport across the inner membrane. We demonstrate that COA6 acts as a thiol-reductase to reduce disulfide bridges of critical cysteine residues in SCO1 and SCO2. Cysteines within the CX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>N</sub>H domain of SCO2 mediate its interaction with COA6 but are dispensable for SCO2-SCO1 interaction. Our analyses define COA6 as thiol-reductase, which is essential for Cu<sub>A</sub> biogenesis."	"We present prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of de novo distal 5p deletion and distal 22q duplication.A 34-year-old woman was underwent amniocentesis at 17 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age. Amniocentesis revealed a derivative chromosome 5 [der(5)] with an abnormal distal 5p segment of unknown origin. The parental karyotypes were normal. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis was performed on the cultured amniocytes, and the result was arr 5p15.33p13.3 (22,149-29,760,922) × 1.0, arr 22q13.2q13.33 (42, 192, 065-51,178,264) × 3.0 [GRCh37 (hg19)] with a 29.739-Mb deletion of 5p15.33-p13.3 encompassing 55 [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)] genes including TPPP, TERT, SRD5A1, SEMA5A and CTNND2, and an 8.986-Mb duplication of 22q13.2-q13.33 encompassing 82 OMIM genes including TRMU, SCO2, TYMP, CPT1B and SHANK3. The fetal karyotype was 46,XY,der(5)t(5; 22)(p13.3; q13.2)dn. The pregnancy was subsequently terminated, and a malformed fetus was delivered with facial dysmorphism. Postnatal polymorphic DNA marker analysis confirmed a maternal origin of the aberrant chromosome 5.aCGH and polymorphic DNA marker analyses can determine the nature and parental origin of the de novo chromosome aberration, and the information acquired is useful for genetic counseling."	"The Warburg effect is an emerging hallmark of cancer, which has the tumor suppressor p53 as its major regulator. Herein, we unveiled that p53 activation by (<i>S</i>)-tryptophanol-derived oxazoloisoindolinone (SLMP53-1) mediated the reprograming of glucose metabolism in cancer cells and xenograft human tumor tissue, interfering with angiogenesis and migration. Particularly, we showed that SLMP53-1 regulated glycolysis by downregulating glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase-2 (HK2), and phosphofructokinase-2 isoform 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3) (key glycolytic enzymes), while upregulating the mitochondrial markers synthesis of cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase 2 (SCO2), cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunit 4 (COX4), and OXPHOS mitochondrial complexes. SLMP53-1 also downregulated the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), causing the subsequent reduction of lactate export by cancer cells. Besides the acidification of the extracellular environment, SLMP53-1 further increased E-cadherin and reduced metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression levels in both cancer cells and xenograft human tumor tissue, which suggested the interference of SLMP53-1 in extracellular matrix remodeling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Consistently, SLMP53-1 depleted angiogenesis, decreasing endothelial cell tube formation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels. SLMP53-1 also exhibited synergistic growth inhibitory activity in combination with the metabolic modulator dichloroacetic acid. These data reinforce the promising application of the p53-activating agent SLMP53-1 in cancer therapy, by targeting p53-mediated pathways of growth and dissemination."	"Cox17 is an assembly factor that participates in early cytochrome c oxidase (COX, CcO) assembly stages. Cox17 shuttles copper ions from the cytosol to the mitochondria and, together with Sco1 and Sco2, provides copper ions to the Cox1 and Cox2 mitochondrially encoded subunits. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cox17 also modulates mitochondrial membrane architecture due to the interaction of Cox17 with proteins of the MICOS complex (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system). There is currently no data regarding the impact of long-term Cox17 deficiency in human cells. Here, we present construction and characterization of three stable COX17 shRNA-downregulated HEK293 cell lines that have less than 10 % of the residual Cox17 protein level. Cox17-depleted cell lines exhibited decreased intramitochondrial copper content, decreased CcO subunit levels (Cox1, Cox4 and Cox5a) and accumulation of CcO subcomplexes. Similarly to yeast cells, mitochondria in Cox17-downregulated HEK293 cell lines exhibited ultrastructural changes including cristae reduction and mitochondrial swelling. Characterization of the molecular pathogenesis of long-term Cox17 deficiency complements our knowledge of the mitochondrial copper metabolism and assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in human cells."	"In eukaryotes, cellular respiration is driven by mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), an enzyme complex that requires copper cofactors for its catalytic activity. Insertion of copper into its catalytically active subunits, including COX2, is a complex process that requires metallochaperones and redox proteins including SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, a recently discovered protein whose molecular function is unknown. To uncover the molecular mechanism by which COA6 and SCO proteins mediate copper delivery to COX2, we have solved the solution structure of COA6, which reveals a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain typical of redox-active proteins found in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. Accordingly, we demonstrate that COA6 can reduce the copper-coordinating disulfides of its client proteins, SCO1 and COX2, allowing for copper binding. Finally, our determination of the interaction surfaces and reduction potentials of COA6 and its client proteins provides a mechanism of how metallochaperone and disulfide reductase activities are coordinated to deliver copper to CcO."	"Reactions of the hydrogen atom and the oxygen molecule are among the most important ones in the hydrogen and hydrocarbon oxidation mechanisms, including combustion in a supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> (sCO<sub>2</sub>) environment, known as oxy-combustion or the Allam cycle. Development of these energy technologies requires understanding of chemical kinetics of H + O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ HO + O and H + O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ HO<sub>2</sub> in high pressures and concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>. Here, we combine quantum treatment of the reaction system by the transition state theory with classical molecular dynamics simulation and the multistate empirical valence bonding method to treat environmental effects. Potential of mean force in the sCO<sub>2</sub> solvent at various temperatures 1000-2000 K and pressures 100-400 atm was obtained. The reaction rate for H + O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ HO + O was found to be pressure-independent and described by the extended Arrhenius equation 4.23 × 10<sup>-7</sup> T<sup>-0.73</sup> exp(-21 855.2 cal/mol/RT) cm<sup>3</sup>/molecule/s, while the reaction rate H + O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ HO<sub>2</sub> is pressure-dependent and can be expressed as 5.22 × 10<sup>-2</sup> T<sup>-2.86</sup> exp(-7247.4 cal/mol/RT) cm<sup>3</sup>/molecule/s at 300 atm."	"In this work, we describe the morphological, electronic and catalytic properties of support TiO<sub>2</sub>-CeO<sub>2</sub>-ZrO<sub>2</sub>, prepared by sol-gel method, which was impregnated with copper at 5 and 10% by weight, in order to obtain efficient catalysts in the catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) of 2-cp. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDS), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and nitrogen physisorption by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The activity of the materials used in this study revealed that without the presence of Cu, the SCO<sub>2</sub> is low and with a content of 10% this metal shows the best catalytic behaviour; conversely, a reaction mechanism is proposed that describes the complete oxidation of 2-cp in this case."	"This study evaluated whether the reduction of prefrontal cortex oxygenation (ScO<sub>2</sub> ) during maximal exercise depends on the hyperventilation-induced hypocapnic attenuation of middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA V<sub>mean</sub> ). Twelve endurance-trained males (age: 25 ± 3 years, height: 183 ± 8 cm, weight: 75 ± 9 kg; mean ± SD) performed in three separate laboratory visits, a maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max) test, an isocapnic (end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> tension (PetCO<sub>2</sub> ) clamped at 40 ± 1 mmHg), and an ambient air controlled-pace constant load high-intensity ergometer cycling to exhaustion, while MCA V<sub>mean</sub> (transcranial Doppler ultrasound) and ScO<sub>2</sub> (near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined. Duration of exercise (12 min 25 s ± 1 min 18 s) was matched by performing the isocapnic trial first. Pulmonary VO<sub>2</sub> was 90 ± 6% versus 93 ± 5% of the maximal value (P = .012) and PetCO<sub>2</sub> 40 ± 1 versus 34 ± 4 mmHg (P &lt; .05) during the isocapnic and control trials, respectively. During the isocapnic trial MCA V<sub>mean</sub> increased by 16 ± 13% until clamping was applied and continued to increase (by 14 ± 28%; P = .017) until the end of exercise, while there was no significant change during the control trial (P = .071). In contrast, ScO<sub>2</sub> decreased similarly in both trials (-3.2 ± 5.1% and -4.1 ± 9.6%; P &lt; .001, isocapnic and control, respectively) at exhaustion. The reduction in prefrontal cortex oxygenation during maximal exercise does not depend solely on lowered cerebral blood flow as indicated by middle cerebral blood velocity."	"High myopia (HM) is defined as a refractive error worse than -6.00 diopter (D). This study aims to update the phenotypic and genotypic landscape of nonsyndromic HM and to establish a biological link between the phenotypic traits and genetic deficiencies.A cross-sectional study involving 731 participants varying in refractive error, axial length (AL), age, myopic retinopathy, and visual impairment. The phenotypic traits were analyzed by four ophthalmologists while mutational screening was performed in eight autosomal causative genes. Finally, we assessed the clinical relevance of identified mutations under the guidance of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.The relationship between refractive error and AL varied in four different age groups ranging from 3- to 85-years old. In adult groups older than 21 years, 1-mm increase in AL conferred 10.84% higher risk of pathologic retinopathy (Category ≥2) as well as 7.35% higher risk of low vision (best-corrected visual acuities &lt;0.3) with P values &lt; 0.001. The prevalence rates of pathologic retinopathy and low vision both showed a nonlinear positive correlation with age. Forty-five patients were confirmed to harbor pathogenic mutations, including 20 novel mutations. These mutations enriched the mutational pool of nonsyndromic HM to 1.5 times its previous size and enabled a statistically significant analysis of the genotype-phenotype correlation. Finally, SLC39A5, CCDC111, BSG, and P4HA2 were more relevant to eye elongation, while ZNF644, SCO2, and LEPREL1 appeared more relevant to refracting media.Our findings shed light on how multiple HM-related phenotypes are associated with each other and their link with gene variants."	"The impact of aging on cerebrovascular function and tissue oxygenation during graded hypoxemia is incompletely known. This study compared the age effect on these variables during cyclic hypoxemia-reoxygenation.Hypoxia-induced changes in arterial (SaO<sub>2</sub>) and cerebral tissue (ScO<sub>2</sub>) O<sub>2</sub> saturation, middle cerebral arterial flow velocity (V<sub>MCA</sub>), estimated cerebral vascular conductance (CVC), heart rate (HR) and ventilation were compared between 12 elderly (71 ± 2 yr, 7 women) and 13 young (24 ± 3 yr, 5 women) adults during the first and fifth 5-min exposures to 10% O<sub>2</sub>.Although pre-hypoxia SaO<sub>2</sub> did not differ between the groups, ScO<sub>2</sub> was lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the elderly (68.4 ± 1.2%) than young (73.8 ± 0.9%) adults, commensurate with a lower resting V<sub>MCA</sub> (P &lt; 0.05). SaO<sub>2</sub> fell less sharply (P &lt; 0.05) in the elderly subjects during the first and fifth hypoxia exposures. Moreover, the responses of ScO<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>MCA</sub>, CVC, HR and breathing frequency to hypoxia were attenuated in the elderly subjects. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures fell by 2-6 mmHg during hypoxia in both young and elderly. Thus, hypoxemia developed more gradually in elderly than young adults during normobaric hypoxia, concordant with a reduced metabolic demand in the elderly.The elderly adults safely tolerated cyclic, moderate hypoxemia which lowered SaO<sub>2</sub> by 20-25%, despite dampening of cerebrovascular and cardiac responses to hypoxemia."	"A novel array double dielectric barrier discharge (ADDBD) combined with a TiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/AC (TiCo) catalyst was applied to remove toluene. The effects of catalyst setting distance, catalyst combination mode, and process factors (including specific input energy, initial toluene concentration, and relative humidity) were investigated in terms of the toluene degradation efficiency (η<sub>toluene</sub>) and the selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub> (S<sub>CO2</sub>). When the specific input energy was 65 J·L<sup>-1</sup>, the initial toluene concentration was 100 mg·m<sup>-3</sup>, and the relative humidity was 30%, the highest η<sub>toluene</sub> of 72% and S<sub>CO2</sub> of 44% could be achieved with TiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 10 cm and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/AC 20 cm downstream of the ADDBD. Based on the determination of active substances (e.g., O<sub>3</sub>, OH) and the catalyst activation mode, a synergistic effect of active substances and photon between the ADDBD and the TiCo catalyst was proposed for the removal of toluene. Finally, the biodegradability and toxicity of the outlet gas were evaluated, and the results showed that the outlet gas was more convenient for subsequent biopurification and less toxic to the surroundings after the treatment by the ADDBD combined with the TiCo catalyst."	"Reductions in cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) measured by near infra-red spectroscopy have been found during compensated hypovolemia in the lower body negative pressure (LBNP)-model, which may reflect reduced cerebral blood flow. However, ScO2 may also be contaminated from extracranial (scalp) tissues, mainly supplied by the external carotid artery (ECA), and it is possible that a ScO2 reduction during hypovolemia is caused by reduced scalp, and not cerebral, blood flow. The aim of the present study was to explore the associations between blood flow in precerebral arteries and ScO2 during LBNP-induced hypovolemia. Twenty healthy volunteers were exposed to LBNP 20, 40, 60 and 80 mmHg. Blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA), ECA and vertebral artery (VA) was measured by Doppler ultrasound. Stroke volume for calculating cardiac output was measured by suprasternal Doppler. Associations of changes within subjects were examined using linear mixed-effects regression models. LBNP reduced cardiac output, ScO2 and ICA and ECA blood flow. Changes in flow in both ICA and ECA were associated with changes in ScO2 and cardiac output. Flow in the VA did not change during LBNP and changes in VA flow were not associated with changes in ScO2 or cardiac output. During experimental compensated hypovolemia in healthy, conscious subjects, a reduced ScO2 may thus reflect a reduction in both cerebral and extracranial blood flow."	"Phytochemical extracts are highly complex chemical mixtures. In the context of an increasing demand for phytopharmaceuticals, assessment of the phytochemical equivalence of extraction procedures is of utmost importance. Compared to routine analytical methods, comprehensive metabolite profiling has pushed forward the concept of phytochemical equivalence. In this study, an untargeted metabolomic approach was used to cross-compare four marketed extracts from <i>Serenoa repens</i> obtained with three different extraction processes: ethanolic, hexanic and sCO<sub>2</sub> (supercritical carbon dioxide). Our approach involved a biphasic extraction of native compounds followed by liquid chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomic workflow. Our results showed significant differences in the contents of major and minor compounds according to the extraction solvent used. The analyses showed that ethanolic extracts were supplemented in phosphoglycerides and polyphenols, hexanic extracts had higher amounts of free fatty acids and minor compounds, and sCO<sub>2</sub> samples contained more glycerides. The discriminant model in this study could predict the extraction solvent used in commercial samples and highlighted the specific biomarkers of each process. This metabolomic survey allowed the authors to assess the phytochemical content of extracts and finished products of <i>S. repens</i> and unequivocally established that sCO<sub>2</sub>, hexanic and ethanolic extracts are not chemically equivalent and are therefore unlikely to be pharmacologically equivalent."	"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to evaluate regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (ScO<sub>2</sub>) during the last decades. Perioperative management algorithms advocate to maintain ScO<sub>2</sub>, by maintaining or increasing cardiac output (CO), e.g. with fluid infusion. We hypothesized that ScO<sub>2</sub> would increase in responders to a standardized fluid challenge (FC) and that the relative changes in CO and ScO<sub>2</sub> would correlate. This study is a retrospective substudy of the FLuid Responsiveness Prediction Using Extra Systoles (FLEX) trial. In the FLEX trial, patients were administered two standardized FCs (5 mL/kg ideal body weight each) during cardiac surgery. NIRS monitoring was used during the intraoperative period and CO was monitored continuously. Patients were considered responders if stroke volume increased more than 10% following FC. Datasets from 29 non-responders and 27 responders to FC were available for analysis. Relative changes of ScO<sub>2</sub> did not change significantly in non-responders (mean difference - 0.3% ± 2.3%, p = 0.534) or in fluid responders (mean difference 1.6% ± 4.6%, p = 0.088). Relative changes in CO and ScO<sub>2</sub> correlated significantly, p = 0.027. Increasing CO by fluid did not change cerebral oxygenation. Despite this, relative changes in CO correlated to relative changes in ScO<sub>2</sub>. However, the clinical impact of the present observations is unclear, and the results must be interpreted with caution.Trial registration:http://ClinicalTrial.gov identifier for main study (FLuid Responsiveness Prediction Using Extra Systoles-FLEX): NCT03002129."	"Fossil fuel oxy-combustion is an emerging technology where the habitual nitrogen diluent is replaced by high-pressure supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> (sCO<sub>2</sub>), which increases the efficiency of energy conversion. In this study, the chemical kinetics of the combustion reaction C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> ⇌ CH<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub> in the sCO<sub>2</sub> environment is predicted at 30-1000 atm and 1000-2000 K. We adopt a multiscale approach, where the reactive complex is treated quantum mechanically in rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator approximation, while environment effects at different densities are taken into account by the potential of mean force, produced with classical molecular dynamics (MD). Here, we used boxed MD, where enhanced sampling of infrequent events of barrier crossing is accomplished without application of the bias potential. The multistate empirical valence bond model is applied to describe free radical formation accurately at the cost of the classical force field. Predicted rates at low densities agree well with the literature data.

"Exomes of 27 Russian subjects were analyzed for the presence of medically relevant alleles, such as protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in known recessive disease-associated genes and pathogenic missense mutations included in the ClinVar database. 36 variants (24 PTVs and 12 amino acid substitutions) were identified and then subjected to the analysis in 897 population controls. 9/36 mutations were novel, however only two of them (POLH c.490delG associated with xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) and CATSPER1 c.859_860delCA responsible for spermatogenic failure) were shown to be recurrent. 27 out of 36 pathogenic alleles were already described in prior genetic studies; seven of them occurred only in the index cases, while 20 demonstrated evidence for persistence in Russian population. In particular, non-random occurrence was revealed for SERPINA1 c.1096G &gt; A (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), C8B c.1282C &gt; T and c.1653G &gt; A (complement component 8B deficiency), ATP7B c.3207C &gt; A (Wilson disease), PROP1 c.301_302delAG (combined pituitary hormone deficiency), CYP21A2 c.844G &gt; T (non-classical form of adrenogenital syndrome), EYS c.1155T &gt; A (retinitis pigmentosa), HADHA c.1528G &gt; C (LCHAD deficiency), SCO2 c.418G &gt; A (cytochrome c oxidase deficiency), OTOA c.2359G &gt; T (sensorineural deafness), C2 c.839_866del (complement component 2 deficiency), ACADVL c.848T &gt; C (VLCAD deficiency), TGM5 c.337G &gt; T (acral peeling skin syndrome) and VWF c.2561 G &gt; A (von Willebrand disease, type 2N). These data deserve to be considered in future medical genetic activities."	"The rice spittlebug <i>Callitettix versicolor</i> (Fabricius) is an important pest of rice and maize in South Asia and causes severe economic damage. To provide background information for chemical ecology studies, the fine morphology of antennae and the types and distribution of the sensilla on the male and female antennae of <i>Callitettix versicolor</i> (Fabricius) are investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results show that the antenna is filiform and composed of three segments: a scape, a pedicel, and a flagellum. The female antennae are slightly shorter than the male antennae. In both sexes, four types and nine subtypes of sensilla were observed: sensilla basiconica (SB1, SB2), sensilla campaniformia (SCa1, SCa2 and SCa3), sensilla coeloconica (SCo1, SCo2 and SCo3) and sensilla trichodea (ST). In addition, sensilla coeloconica (SCo1) are observed on the membrane of the top of the pedicel in Cercopidae for the first time. Sexual dimorphism mainly occurs in variation in the number of sensilla coeloconica (SCo2, SCo3) on the bulb-shaped portion of the flagellum and in the shape of sensilla basiconica (SB2). There are significantly more sensilla coeloconica in males than in females. The external structure and distribution of these sensilla are compared to those of other cercopids and possible functions of the antennal sensilla are discussed."	"Controlled hypotensive anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery would provide a clean surgical field. Cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO<sub>2</sub>) is important in endoscopic sinus surgery patients and it may be low during controlled hypotension. The aim of the present study was to assess ScO<sub>2</sub> in these patients.In this observational study, 41 patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery with hypotensive anesthesia were enrolled for the study and all of the patients received the same anesthetic medication, nitroglycerin for controlled hypotension. Variables were measured prior to surgery, after induction of anesthesia, 5 min, and every 30 min after controlled hypotension. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used for ScO<sub>2</sub> evaluation. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at 55-60 mmHg in the surgical duration. We used <i>t</i>-test, Wilcoxon, and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). We examined the cross-correlation functions of the time series data between end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>)/MAP and ScO<sub>2</sub>.The mean of intraoperative ScO<sub>2</sub> was not significantly different from the baseline evaluation (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). ETCO<sub>2</sub> was cross correlated with current ScO<sub>2</sub> [<i>r</i>: 0.618, confidence interval (CI) 95%: 0.46-0.78]. We found moderate cross correlation between the MAP and current ScO<sub>2</sub> (<i>r</i>: 0.728, CI 95%: 0.56-0.88). About 92% of the patients recovered within 30 min. Recovery time was associated with intraoperative MAP (<i>P</i>: 0.004, <i>r</i>: 0.438), intraoperative ETCO<sub>2</sub> (<i>P</i>: 0.003, <i>r</i>: 0.450), and ScO<sub>2</sub> (<i>P</i>: 0.026, <i>r</i>: 0.348).Based on our findings, the assessment of ScO<sub>2</sub> and maintained MAP &gt;55 mmHg may provide safe conditions for endoscopic sinus surgery."	"p53-dependent vascular smooth muscle cell senescence is a key pathological process of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Caloric restriction (CR) is a nonpharmacological intervention that prevents AAA formation. However, whether p53 is indispensable to the protective role of CR remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the necessity of p53 in the beneficial role of CR in AAA formation and the underlying mechanisms. We subjected p53<sup>+/+</sup> and p53<sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> mice to 12 weeks of CR and then examined the incidence of Ang II (angiotensin II)-induced AAA formation. We found that both CR and p53 knockout reduced Ang II-induced AAA formation; however, CR markedly increased the incidence of AAA formation and exacerbated aortic elastin degradation in p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice, accompanied by increased vascular senescence, reactive oxygen species generation, and reduced energy production. Analysis of mitochondrial respiratory activity revealed that dysfunctional complex IV accounts for the abnormal mitochondrial respiration in p53<sup>-/-</sup> vascular smooth muscle cells treated by CR serum. Mechanistically, ablation of p53 almost totally blocked the protective role of CR by inhibiting SCO2 (cytochrome C oxidase assembly protein 2)-dependent mitochondrial complex IV activity. Overexpression of SCO2 restored the beneficial effect of CR on antagonizing Ang II-induced expression of AAA-related molecules and reactive oxygen species generation in p53<sup>-/-</sup> vascular smooth muscle cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that the existence of p53 in vascular smooth muscle cells is critical to the protective role of CR in Ang II-induced AAA formation by maintaining an appropriate mitochondrial function."

"SLC19A3"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) may present in childhood, early infancy, or adulthood. The classic presentation of BTBGD occurs in childhood (age 3-10 years) and is characterized by recurrent subacute encephalopathy manifest as confusion, seizures, ataxia, dystonia, supranuclear facial palsy, external ophthalmoplegia, and/or dysphagia which, if left untreated, can eventually lead to coma and even death. Dystonia and cogwheel rigidity are nearly always present; hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and Babinski responses are common. Hemiparesis or quadriparesis may be seen. Episodes are often triggered by febrile illness or mild trauma or stress. Simple partial or generalized seizures are easily controlled with antiepileptic drugs. An early-infantile Leigh-like syndrome / atypical infantile spasms presentation occurs in the first three months of life with poor feeding, vomiting, acute encephalopathy and severe lactic acidosis. An adult-onset Wernicke-like encephalopathy presentation is characterized by acute onset of status epilepticus, ataxia, nystagmus, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia in the second decade of life. Prompt administration of biotin and thiamine early in the disease course results in partial or complete improvement within days in the childhood and adult presentations, but most with the infantile presentation have had poor outcome even after supplementation with biotin and thiamine.The diagnosis of BTBGD is established in a proband with biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>SLC19A3</i> by molecular genetic testing.<i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Biotin (5-10 mg/kg/day) and thiamine (up to 40 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 1500 mg daily) are given orally as early in the disease course as possible and are continued lifelong. Symptoms typically resolve within days. Acute encephalopathic episodes may require care in an ICU to manage seizures and increased intracranial pressure; during acute decompensations thiamine may be increased to double the regular dose and be given intravenously. Antiepileptic drugs are used to control seizures. Treatment of dystonia is symptomatic and includes administration of trihexyphenidyl or L-dopa. Rehabilitation, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy as needed and adaptation of educational programs to meet individual needs. Education of the family regarding the importance of lifelong compliance with medical therapy. <i>Prevention of primary manifestations:</i> Prompt administration of biotin and thiamine early in the disease course. <i>Surveillance:</i> Clinical review of neurologic status every six months; annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; social support and care coordination each visit. <i>Agents/circumstances to avoid:</i> Infections, stress, profuse exercise and trauma. <i>Evaluation of relatives at risk:</i> It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives (e.g., sibs ) of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment with biotin and thiamine and preventive measures (avoidance of stress and trauma). <i>Pregnancy management:</i> Affected women should continue thiamine and biotin during pregnancy.BTBGD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the <i>SLC19A3</i> pathogenic variants in the family have been identified."	"Background Growing evidence reports an association between inflammatory markers, obesity and blood pressure (BP). Specifically, the intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7556897T &gt; C (MAF = 0.34) located between SLC19A3 and the CCL20 was shown to be associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. In addition, CCL20 expression was found increased in pancreatic islets of obese rodents and human pancreatic β cells under the influence of inflammation. In this study, we hypothesized that SNP rs7556897 could affect BP levels, thus providing a link between inflammation, BP and obesity. Methods BP was measured under supine position with a manual sphygmomanometer; values reported were the means of three readings. We analyzed rs7556897 in 577 normal weight and 689 obese French children. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we quantified CCL20 and SLC19A3 expression in adipose tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of normal weight and overweight children. Results The rs7556897C allele was negatively associated with diastolic BP in normal weight children (β = -0.012 ± 0.004, p = 0.006) but positively associated in obese children (β = 2.178 ± 0.71, p = 0.002). A significant interaction between rs7556897T &gt; C and the obesity status (obese or normal weight) was detected (β = 3.49, p = 9.79 × 10-5) for BP in a combined population analysis. CCL20 mRNA was only expressed in the adipose tissue of overweight children, and its expression levels were 10.7×  higher in PBMCs of overweight children than normal weight children. Finally, CCL20 mRNA levels were positively associated with rs7556897T &gt; C in PBMCs of 58 normal weight children (β = 0.43, p = 0.002). SLC19A3 was not expressed in PBMCs, and in adipose tissue, it showed same levels of expression in normal weight and overweight children. The gene expression results may highlight a specific involvement of CCL20 via communicating obesity/inflammation pathways that regulate BP. Conclusions Childhood obesity reverses the effect of rs7556897T &gt; C on diastolic BP, possibly via the modulation of CCL20 expression levels."	"To explore the genetic basis for a neonate featuring global developmental delay.Clinical and laboratory tests were carried out for the patient. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the neonate and his parents for the extraction of DNA. Potential variant was detected by using targeted capture and next generation sequencing for a panel of genes associated with nervous system diseases. Suspected variant was validated by Sanger sequencing.The nine-month-old boy manifested global developmental delay and was unstable to sit alone and distinguish strangers from acquaintance. Genetic testing revealed two novel variants of the SLC19A3 gene in him, namely c.448G&gt;A and c.169C&gt;T. The amino acids encoded by the two codons are highly conservative, and both variants were predicted to be pathogenic by bioinformatic analysis.The compound heterozygous c.448G&gt;A and c.169C&gt;T variants probably underlay the onset of disease in the patient. Above finding also enriched the variant spectrum of SLC19A3 gene underlying Biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease."	"Leigh syndrome (LS), the most common childhood mitochondrial disorder, has characteristic clinical and neuroradiologic features. Mutations in more than 75 genes have been identified in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genome, implicating a high degree of genetic heterogeneity in LS. To profile these genetic signatures and understand the pathophysiology of LS, we recruited 64 patients from 62 families who were clinically diagnosed with LS at Seoul National University Children's Hospital. Mitochondrial genetic analysis followed by whole-exome sequencing was performed on 61 patients. Pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA were identified in 18 families and nuclear DNA mutations in 22. The following 17 genes analyzed in 40 families were found to have genetic complexity: MTATP6, MTND1, MTND3, MTND5, MTND6, MTTK, NDUFS1, NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, SURF1, SLC19A3, ECHS1, PNPT1, IARS2, NARS2, VPS13D, and NAXE. Two treatable cases had biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease, and another three were identified as having defects in the newly recognized genes (VPS13D or NAXE). Variants in the nuclear genes that encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases were present in 27.3% of cases. Our findings expand the genetic and clinical spectrum of LS, showing genetic heterogeneity and highlighting treatable cases and those with novel genetic causes."

Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is characterized by seizures, dystonia and encephalopathy attacks, with an acute-subacute onset in childhood. It causes cerebral damage especially with caudate head and putamen involvement and may lead to severe sequelae and even death if left untreated. We report a patient with the neonatal form of biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease who presented with encephalopathy and lactic acidosis in the neonatal period together with the diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clues. MRI in the neonatal period revealed bilateral involvement of the putamen, thalamus, and perirolandic cortical regions. However, MRI obtained at 32 months revealed involvement of the caudate nuclei in addition to the putamen and thalami. The neuroimaging findings of our patient and relevant literature indicate that patients with biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease who are symptomatic in the neonatal period have putamen, thalami, and perirolandic cortical involvement. However, these patients do not have caudate involvement, unlike the patients who present in childhood."	"Transporter-mediated drug-nutrient interactions have the potential to cause serious adverse events. However, unlike drug-drug interactions, these drug-nutrient interactions receive little attention during drug development. The clinical importance of drug-nutrient interactions was highlighted when a phase III clinical trial was terminated due to severe adverse events resulting from potent inhibition of thiamine transporter 2 (ThTR-2; SLC19A3).In this study, we tested the hypothesis that therapeutic drugs inhibit the intestinal thiamine transporter ThTR-2, which may lead to thiamine deficiency.For this exploration, we took a multifaceted approach, starting with a high-throughput in vitro primary screen to identify inhibitors, building in silico models to characterize inhibitors, and leveraging real-world data from electronic health records to begin to understand the clinical relevance of these inhibitors.Our high-throughput screen of 1360 compounds, including many clinically used drugs, identified 146 potential inhibitors at 200 μM. Inhibition kinetics were determined for 28 drugs with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 1.03 μM to &gt;1 mM. Several oral drugs, including metformin, were predicted to have intestinal concentrations that may result in ThTR-2-mediated drug-nutrient interactions. Complementary analysis using electronic health records suggested that thiamine laboratory values are reduced in individuals receiving prescription drugs found to significantly inhibit ThTR-2, particularly in vulnerable populations (e.g., individuals with alcoholism).Our comprehensive analysis of prescription drugs suggests that several marketed drugs inhibit ThTR-2, which may contribute to thiamine deficiency, especially in at-risk populations."	"Thiamine prevents high glucose-induced damage in microvasculature, and progression of retinopathy and nephropathy in diabetic animals. Impaired thiamine availability causes renal damage in diabetic patients. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in <i>SLC19A3</i> locus encoding for thiamine transporter 2 are associated with absent/minimal diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy despite long-term type 1 diabetes. We investigated the involvement of thiamine transporter 1 and thiamine transporter 2, and their transcription factor specificity protein 1, in high glucose-induced damage and altered thiamine availability in cells of the inner blood-retinal barrier. Human endothelial cells, pericytes and Müller cells were exposed to hyperglycaemic-like conditions and/or thiamine deficiency/over-supplementation in single/co-cultures. Expression and localization of thiamine transporter 1, thiamine transporter 2 and transcription factor specificity protein 1 were evaluated together with intracellular thiamine concentration, transketolase activity and permeability to thiamine. The effects of thiamine depletion on cell function (viability, apoptosis and migration) were also addressed. Thiamine transporter 2 and transcription factor specificity protein 1 expression were modulated by hyperglycaemic-like conditions. Transketolase activity, intracellular thiamine and permeability to thiamine were decreased in cells cultured in thiamine deficiency, and in pericytes in hyperglycaemic-like conditions. Thiamine depletion reduced cell viability and proliferation, while thiamine over-supplementation compensated for thiamine transporter 2 reduction by restoring thiamine uptake and transketolase activity. High glucose and reduced thiamine determine impairment in thiamine transport inside retinal cells and through the inner blood-retinal barrier. Thiamine transporter 2 modulation in our cell models suggests its major role in thiamine transport in retinal cells and its involvement in high glucose-induced damage and impaired thiamine availability."	"Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder mostly presented in children. The disorder is described as having subacute encephalopathy with confusion, dystonia, and dysarthria triggered by febrile illness that leads to neuroregression and death if untreated. Using biotin and thiamine at an early stage of the disease can lead to significant improvement.BTBGD is a treatable disease if diagnosed at an early age and has been frequently reported in Saudi population. Keeping this in mind, the current study screened 3000 Saudi newborns for the SLC19A3 gene mutations using target sequencing, aiming to determine the carrier frequency in Saudi Population and whether BTBGD is a good candidate to be included in the newborn-screened disorders.Using targeted gene sequencing, DNA from 3000 newborns Saudi was screened for the SLC19A3 gene mutations using standard methods. Screening of the SLC19A3 gene revealed a previously reported heterozygous missense mutation (c.1264A&gt;G (p.Thr422Ala) in six unrelated newborns. No probands having homozygous pathogenic mutations were found in the studied cohort. The variant has been frequently reported previously in homozygous state in Saudi population, making it a hot spot mutation. The current study showed that the carrier frequency of SLC19A3 gene mutation is 1 of 500 in Saudi newborns.For the first time in the literature, we determined the carrier frequency of SLC19A3 gene mutation in Saudi population. The estimated prevalence is too rare in Saudi population (at least one in million); therefore, the data are not in favor of including such very rare disorders in newborn screening program at population level. However, a larger cohort is needed for a more accurate estimate."	"Thiamine is a crucial cofactor involved in the maintenance of carbohydrate metabolism and participates in multiple cellular metabolic processes within the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. Currently, four genetic defects have been described causing impairment of thiamine transport and metabolism: SLC19A2 dysfunction leads to diabetes mellitus, megaloblastic anemia and sensory-neural hearing loss, whereas SLC19A3, SLC25A19, and TPK1-related disorders result in recurrent encephalopathy, basal ganglia necrosis, generalized dystonia, severe disability, and early death. In order to achieve early diagnosis and treatment, biomarkers play an important role. SLC19A3 patients present a profound decrease of free-thiamine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fibroblasts. TPK1 patients show decreased concentrations of thiamine pyrophosphate in blood and muscle. Thiamine supplementation has been shown to improve diabetes and anemia control in Rogers' syndrome patients due to SLC19A2 deficiency. In a significant number of patients with SLC19A3, thiamine improves clinical outcome and survival, and prevents further metabolic crisis. In SLC25A19 and TPK1 defects, thiamine has also led to clinical stabilization in single cases. Moreover, thiamine supplementation leads to normal concentrations of free-thiamine in the CSF of SLC19A3 patients. Herein, we present a literature review of the current knowledge of the disease including related clinical phenotypes, treatment approaches, update of pathogenic variants, as well as in vitro and in vivo functional models that provide pathogenic evidence and propose mechanisms for thiamine deficiency in humans."	"Biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease (BTRBGD) is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder with poor genotype-phenotype correlation, caused by mutations in the <i>SLC19A3</i> gene on chromosome 2q36.6. The disease is characterized by three stages: stage 1 is a sub-acute encephalopathy often triggered by febrile illness; stage 2 is an acute encephalopathy with seizures, loss of motor function, developmental regression, dystonia, external ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, and dysarthria; stage 3 is represented by chronic or slowly progressive encephalopathy. Clinical and biochemical findings, as well as the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern, resemble those of Leigh's syndrome, so that BTRBGD can be misdiagnosed as a mitochondrial encephalopathy.Here we report the clinical and radiological phenotypes of two siblings diagnosed with BTRBGD in which a novel <i>SLC19A3</i> mutation (NM_025243.3: c.548C &gt; T; p.Ala183Val) was found by whole exome sequencing (WES) of the family members."	"The patient was a male who was found to be abnormal at the age of 4.5 months. He presented with irritability, motor regression and opisthotonus. Brain MRI revealed bilateral abnormality in the lentiform nucleus, thalamus, deutocerebrum and cerebellar hemispheres. Novel compound heterozygous mutations of SLC19A3 gene, c.950G&gt;A(p.G317E) and c.962C&gt;T(p.A321V), were found in the patient. Further study showed that c.950G&gt;A was inherited from his father and c.962C&gt;T came from his mother. Using bioinformatics software analysis, both of the mutations were found to be harmful. His symptoms were improved remarkably after biotin, thiamine and &quot;cocktail&quot; therapy. One month later a brain MRI revealed that the lesions in basal ganglia and cerebellar hemispheres were improved. The patient was definitely diagnosed with biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD). BTBGD is a treatable autosomal recessive disease and early administration of biotin and thiamine may lead to clinical improvement."	"Thiamin (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) is essential for normal cellular metabolism and function. Pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) obtain thiamin from the circulation via a specific carrier-mediated process that involves the plasma membrane thiamin transporters 1 and 2 (THTR-1 and THTR-2; products of <i>SLC19A2</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i> genes, respectively). There is nothing known about the effect of bacterial products/toxins on thiamin uptake by PACs. We addressed this issue in the present investigation by examining the effect of bacterial flagellin on physiological and molecular parameters of thiamin uptake by PACs. We used human primary PACs, mice in vivo, and cultured mouse-derived pancreatic acinar 266-6 cells in our investigation. The results showed that exposure of human primary PACs to flagellin led to a significant inhibition in thiamin uptake; this inhibition was associated with a significant decrease in expression of THTR-1 and -2 at the protein and mRNA levels. These findings were confirmed in mice in vivo as well as in cultured 266-6 cells. Subsequent studies showed that flagellin exposure markedly suppressed the activity of the <i>SLC19A2</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i> promoters and that this effect involved the Sp1 regulatory factor. Finally, knocking down Toll-like receptor 5 by use of gene-specific siRNA was found to lead to abrogation in the inhibitory effect of flagellin on PAC thiamin uptake. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of PACs to flagellin negatively impacts the physiological and molecular parameters of thiamin uptake and that this effect is mediated at the level of transcription of the <i>SLC19A2</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i> genes. <b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that prolonged exposure of pancreatic acinar cells to flagellin inhibits uptake of vitamin B<sub>1</sub>, a micronutrient that is essential for energy metabolism and ATP production. This effect is mediated at the level of transcription of the SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 genes and involves the Sp1 transcription factor."	"Biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC19A3 gene and characterized by recurrent sub-acute episodes of encephalopathy that typically starts in early childhood. This study describes characteristic clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of six cases of BTBGD diagnosed with newly identified mutations and genetically confirmed, with very early and different presentations compared to cases in the previous literature.Six patients referred from different centers with similar clinical findings were diagnosed with BTBGD with newly identified mutations in the SLC19A3 gene. Two novel mutations in the SLC19A3 gene were identified in two patients at whole exome sequencing analysis. The clinical characteristics, responses to treatment, and electroencephalography (EEG) and MRI findings of these patients were examined. The other four patients presented with similar clinical and cranial MRI findings. These patients were therefore started on high-dose biotin and thiamine therapy, and mutation analysis concerning the SLC19A3 gene was performed. Responses to treatment, clinical courses, EEG findings and follow-up MRI were recorded for all these patients.Age at onset of symptoms ranged from 1 to 3 months. The first symptoms were generally persistent crying and restlessness. Seizures occurred in five of the six patients. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed involvement in the basal ganglia, brain stem, and the parietal and frontal regions in general. The first two patients were siblings, and both exhibited a novel mutation of the SLC19A3 gene. The third and fourth patients were also siblings and also exhibited a similar novel mutation of the SLC19A3 gene. The fifth and sixth patients were not related, and a newly identified mutation was detected in both these subjects. Three novel mutations were thus detected in six patients.BTBGD is a progressive disease that can lead to severe disability and death. Early diagnosis of treatable diseases such as BTBGD is important in order to prevent long-term complications and disability."	"Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is an important vitamin for the body. The activated form of thiamine pyrophosphate is involved in cell metabolism as an important co-enzyme. Defects of thiamine transport and activation may cause lack of thiamine and affection of cell metabolism, leading a variety of diseases. This review has summarized defects of thiamine transport and activation and related diseases."	"Because the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) is ubiquitous, its deficiency can theoretically give rise to any symptom in any organ or tissue at any age with any mode of inheritance, owing to the twofold genetic origin of respiratory enzyme machinery, that is, nuclear and mitochondrial. Not all respiratory enzyme deficiencies are primary and secondary or artefactual deficiency is frequently observed, leading to a number of misleading conclusions and inappropriate investigations in clinical practice. This study is aimed at investigating the potential role of brain MRI in distinguishing primary RC deficiency from phenocopies and other aetiologies.Starting from a large series of 189 patients (median age: 3.5 years (8 days-56 years), 58% males) showing signs of RC enzyme deficiency, for whom both brain MRIs and disease-causing mutations were available, we retrospectively studied the positive predictive value (PPV) and the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of brain MRI imaging and its ability to discriminate between two groups: primary deficiency of the mitochondrial RC machinery and phenocopies.Detection of (1) brainstem hyperintensity with basal ganglia involvement (P≤0.001) and (2) lactate peak with either brainstem or basal ganglia hyperintensity was highly suggestive of primary RC deficiency (P≤0.01). Fourteen items had a PPV&gt;95% and LR+ was greater than 9 for seven signs. Biallelic <i>SLC19A3</i> mutations represented the main differential diagnosis. Non-significant differences between the two groups were found for cortical/subcortical atrophy, leucoencephalopathy and involvement of caudate nuclei, spinothalamic tract and corpus callosum.Based on these results and owing to invasiveness of skeletal muscle biopsies and cost of high-throughput DNA sequencing, we suggest giving consideration to brain MRI imaging as a diagnostic marker and an informative investigation to be performed in patients showing signs of RC enzyme deficiency."	"Encephalopathies with neostriatal involvement constitute a heterogeneous group of acquired and genetically inherited conditions that include Bilateral Striatal Necrosis (BSN) and other Striatal Lesions (SL) (Tonduti et al). We describe two new patients suffering from BSN due to biallelic SLC19A3 mutations. In the first patient vitamin supplementation was started early on, resulting in the remission of the clinical picture, and an almost complete normalization of the neuroradiological findings. In the second one treatment was started late, compliance was irregular and the resulting clinical outcome was poor. The clinical outcome of our two patients confirms and further stresses the importance of the early administration of vitamin supplementation in all patients presenting with neostriatal lesions, or clear bilateral striatal necrosis. Patient 2 didn't present any additional episode of acute decompensation after the age of 20 years despite having completely stopped treatment. This suggests the existence of an age dependency of thiamin requirement in humans."	"Solute carrier family 19 (thiamine transporter), member 3 (<i>SCL19A3</i>) gene defect produces an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder associated with different phenotypes and acronyms. One of the common presentations is early infantile lethal Leigh-like syndrome. We report a case of early infantile Leigh-like <i>SLC19A3</i> gene defects of patients who died at 4 months of age with no response to a high dose of biotin and thiamine. In addition, we report a novel mutation that was not reported previously. Finally, we review the literature regarding early infantile Leigh-like SLC19A3 gene defects and compare the literature with our patient."	"Biotin Thiamine responsive Basal Ganglia Disease (BTBGD) is a rare treatable autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in SLC19A3 gene. It usually presents with encephalopathy and dystonia; if not treated, can progress to quadriparesis and death. Two Indian siblings born to a consanguineous marriage presented with regression of milestones, epilepsy and dystonia. Neuroimaging showed signal changes in basal ganglia and thalami. Genetic testing showed a homozygous missense substitution p.Gly23Val (c.68G &gt; T) in exon 2 of the SLC19A3 gene. Thus to conclude, any child who presents with neuroregression, epilepsy and dystonia in the background of basal ganglia changes on neuroimaging, a possibility of biotin thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease should be considered."

Herein, we investigated the association between the mean tolerable dose of mercaptopurine and these genetic variants in Taiwanese patients.In total, 294 children with ALL were treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital from April 1997 to December 2017. Germline variants were analyzed for NUDT15, SUCLA2, TPMT, ITPA, PACSIN2, and MRP4. Mean daily tolerable doses of mercaptopurine in the continuation phase of treatment were correlated with these genetic variants.Mercaptopurine intolerance was significantly associated with polymorphisms in NUDT15 (P value &lt; 0.0001). Patients with SUCLA2 variants received lower mercaptopurine doses (P value = 0.0119). The mean mercaptopurine doses did not differ among patients with TPMT, ITPA, MRP4, and PACSIN2 polymorphisms (P value = 0.9461, 0.5818, and 0.7951, respectively). After multivariable linear regression analysis, only NUDT15 variants retained their clinically significant correlation with mercaptopurine intolerance (P value &lt; 0.0001).In this cohort, the major genetic determinant of mercaptopurine intolerance was NUDT15 in Taiwanese patients.NUDT15 causes mercaptopurine intolerance in children with ALL.The NUDT15 variant is a stronger predictor of mercaptopurine intolerance than TPMT in a Taiwanese cohort. This finding is similar with studies performed on Asian populations rather than Caucasians.Pre-emptive genotyping of the patients' NUDT15 before administering mercaptopurine may be more helpful than genotyping TPMT in Asians."	"<i>Qishen</i> granules (QSG) has been applied to treat heart failure (HF) for decades. Our previous transcriptomics study has suggested that <i>Qishen</i> granules (QSG) could regulate the pathways of cardiac energy metabolism in HF, but the specific regulatory mechanism has not yet been clarified. This study was to investigate the potential mechanism of QSG in regulating myocardial fatty acid (FA) and glucose metabolism in a rat model of HF.The model of HF was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Cardiac structure and function were assessed by cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography. Level of glucose metabolism was non-invasively evaluated by <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Blood lipid levels were determined by enzymatic analysis. The mitochondrial ultrastructure was observed with a transmission electron microscope. The critical proteins related to FA metabolism, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function were measured by western blotting. The ANOVA followed by a Fisher's LSD test was used for within-group comparisons.QSG ameliorated cardiac functions and attenuated myocardial remodeling in HF model. The levels of serum TC, TG and LDL-C were significantly reduced by QSG. The proteins mediating FA uptake, transportation into mitochondria and β-oxidation (FAT/CD36, CPT1A, ACADL, ACADM, ACAA2 and SCP2) as well as the upstreaming transcriptional regulators of FA metabolism (PPARα, RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ) were up-regulated by QSG. As to glucose metabolism, QSG inhibited glycolytic activity by decreasing LDHA, while stimulated glucose oxidation by decreasing PDK4. Furthermore, QSG could facilitate tricarboxylic acid cycle, promote the transportation of ATP from mitochondria to cytoplasm and restore the mitochondrial function by increasing SUCLA2, CKMT2 and PGC-1α and decreasing UCP2 simultaneously.QSG improved myocardial energy metabolism through increasing FA metabolism,inhibiting uncoupling of glycolysis from glucose oxidation."	"The density of contour feathers is an important trait as it is closely related to heat dissipation in birds. Thus, identification of the major genes that control this trait will be useful to improve heat tolerance in chicken. So far, no GWAS study for the density of contour feathers in birds has been previously published; therefore, this study was aimed to identify genomic regions controlling the density of contour feathers. A total of 1252 hens were genotyped, using the 600 K Affymetrix Axiom Chicken Genotyping Array. The association analyses were performed using the GenABEL package in the R program. In brief, 146 significant SNP markers were mainly located on chromosome 1 and were identified to associate with the density of contour feathers in the current GWAS analysis. Moreover, we identified several within/nearby candidate genes (<i>SUCLA2</i>, <i>DNAJC15</i>, <i>DHRS12</i>, <i>MLNR</i>, and <i>RB1</i>) that are either directly or indirectly involved in the genetic control of the density of contour feathers in chicken. This study laid the foundation for studying the mechanism that underlies the density of chicken feathers. Furthermore, it is feasible to shear the back feathers of live chickens and measure the density of the feathers to improve heat tolerance in breeding practice."	"Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is the most common organic acidemia in China. This study aimed to characterise the genotypic and phenotypic variabilities, and the molecular epidemiology of Chinese patients with isolated MMA. Patients (n = 301) with isolated MMA were diagnosed by clinical examination, biochemical assays, and genetic analysis. Fifty-eight patients (19.3%) were detected by newborn screening and 243 patients (80.7%) were clinically diagnosed after onset. Clinical onset ranged from the age of 3 days to 23 years (mean age = 1.01 ± 0.15 years). Among 234 MMA patients whose detailed clinical data were available, 170 (72.6%) had early onset disease (before the age of 1 year), and 64 (27.4%) had late-onset disease. The 234 MMA patients manifested with neuropsychiatric impairment (65.4%), haematological abnormality (31.6%), renal damage (8.5%), and metabolic crises (67.1%). Haematological abnormality was significantly more common in early-onset patients than that in late-onset patients. The incidence of metabolic crises was significantly high (P &lt; 0.001) in patients with mut type than those with other types of isolated MMA. Variations (n = 122) were identified in MMUT, MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC, SUCLG1, and SUCLA2, of which 45 were novel. c.729_730insTT was the most frequent MMUT mutation, with a significantly higher frequency in our patients than that in 151 reported European patients. The frequency of c.914T&gt;C in MMUT in our cohort was also higher than that in 151 European patients. MMUT mutations c.729_730insTT and c.914T&gt;C are specific for the Chinese population. Our study expanded the spectrum of phenotypes and genotypes in isolated MMA."	"Ηeat and calcium treatments reprogram sweet cherry fruit metabolism during postharvest senescence as evidenced by changes in respiration, amino acid metabolism, sugars, and secondary metabolites shift. Heat and calcium treatments are used to improve postharvest fruit longevity; however, the exact mechanism remains poorly understood. To characterize the impact of these treatments on sweet cherries metabolism, 'Lapins' fruits were treated with heat or CaCl<sub>2</sub> solutions and their combination and subsequently were exposed at room temperature, for up to 4 days, defined as senescence period. Single and combined heat and calcium treatments partially delayed fruit senescence, as evidenced by changes in fruit colour darkening, skin penetration force, and respiration activity. Calcium content was noticeably increased by heat in Ca-treated fruit. Several primary metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids, and alcohols, were decreased in response to both treatments, while many soluble sugars and secondary metabolites were increased within 1 day post-treatment. Changes of several metabolites in heat-treated fruits, especially esculetin, peonidin 3-O-glucoside and peonidin 3-O-galactoside, ribose, pyroglutamate, and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, were detected. The metabolome of fruit exposed to calcium also displayed substantial modulations, particularly in the levels of galactose, glycerate, aspartate, tryptophan, phospharate rutin, and peonidin 3-O-glucoside. The expression of several genes involved in TCA cycle (MDH1, IDH1, OGDH, SUCLA2, and SDH1-1), pectin degradation (ADPG1) as well as secondary (SK1, 4CL1, HCT, and BAN), amino acids (ALDH18A1, ALDH4A1, GS, GAD, GOT2, OPLAH, HSDH, and SDS), and sugar (PDHA1 and DLAT) metabolism were affected by both treatments. Pathway-specific analysis further revealed the regulation of fruit metabolic programming by heat and calcium. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of metabolic regulation in response to heat and calcium during fruit senescence."	"The binding of seminal plasma (SP) proteins by spermatozoa plays an important role in the regulation of sperm epididymal maturation, motility gaining in female reproductive tracts and sperm-egg interaction. The aim of the study was to analyze the SP and sperm extracts proteome of cat (Felis catus) semen. The seminal plasma and spermatozoa were obtained by urethra catheterization from 10 male cats. Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer and separated by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gels were analyzed using MultiAnalyst software. The proteins were subsequently analyzed using NanoUPLC-Q-TOF/MS. UniProt database-supported identification resulted in 106 proteins identified in the cat SP and 98 proteins in the extracts of spermatozoa. Based on a gene ontology analysis, dominant molecular functions of feline SP proteins were binding, catalytic, and antioxidant activity (56%, 33%, and 11% of cases, respectively). The molecular functions of sperm extracts proteins were mainly involved in catalytic activity (41%) and binding (23%). The proteins present in both, the SP and spermatozoa's extracts, were: serum albumin (ALB), semenogelin 2 (SEMG 2), clusterin (CLU), lactoferrin (LTF), prostatic acid phosphatase (ACPP), prolactin inducible protein (PIP), negative elongation factor E (NELF-E) and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase (ENPP3). Protein-protein interactions analysis showed significant connection for 12 proteins in the cat semen. The seminal plasma proteins which, with high probability score, participate in important metabolic pathways are: glutathione peroxidases (GPx5 and 6), prostatic acid phosphatase (ACPP), β-hexosaminidase (HEXB), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1). For sperm protein extracts it were: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHB), succinate-CoA-ligase (SUCLA2), malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5F1A) and tubulin beta (TUBB)."	"<b>Objective:</b> To explore the phenotype and genotype of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS) in Chinese children. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical and genetic data of 12 MDS patients (8 were boys and 4 were girls) diagnosed in the Department of Neurology in Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2010 to April 2018 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The developmental milestones were normal or mildly retardated before disease onset. The age of onset ranged from 0 to 2.9-year-old. Most cases developed postnatal or after infection. The most common initial symptoms were feeding difficulty, seizure, muscle weakness, psychomotor regression and hepatic dysfunction. At the last evaluation, all the patients had developmental retardation, failure to thrive, muscle weakness, and dysphagia. Other clinical features were weight loss (9 cases), hearing impairment (7 cases), ptosis (6 cases), seizure (5 cases), dyspnea (4 cases), visual impairment (1 case), hirsutism (1 case), lactic acidosis (7 cases), elevated hepatic enzymes (4 cases) and creatine kinase (2 cases), elevated protein in cerebrospinal fluid (3 cases), abnormalities on screening for inborn error of metabolism (10 cases) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (10 cases), abnormal electromyogram (including neurogenic or myogenic injury) (5 cases). Five patients died of infection or multiple organ failure. A total of 18 novel mutations presented below were detected in these patients. Among the 6 cases of encephalomyopathy, there were 3 with SUCLG1 mutation (c. 916G&gt;T, c. 619T&gt;C, c. 980dupT were novel), 2 with SUCLA2 mutation (c. 851G&gt;A, c.971G&gt;A were novel), and one with RRM2B mutation (c.456-2A&gt;G, c.212T&gt;C were novel). All the cases of hepatic encephalopathy all had POLG mutations (c. 3151G&gt;A, c. 2294C&gt;T, c. 2858G&gt;C, c. 680G&gt;A and c. 150_158delGCAGCAGCA were novel). Two cases of infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia had TWNK mutations (c. 1163C&gt;T, c. 1319T&gt;C, c. 1388G&gt;A and c. 257_258delAG were novel). One case of myopathy had TK2 mutations (c.557C&gt;G and c.341A&gt;T were novel). <b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical and genetic features of MDS were heterogeneous. Eighteen novel mutations in six MDS related genes were reported, which expanded the genetic spectrum of MDS in Chinese children."	"Succinate-CoA ligase (SUCL) is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha subunit encoded by SUCLG1, and a beta subunit encoded by either SUCLA2 or SUCLG2 catalyzing an ATP- or GTP-forming reaction, respectively, in the mitochondrial matrix. The deficiency of this enzyme represents an encephalomyopathic form of mtDNA depletion syndromes. We describe the fatal clinical course of a female patient with a pathogenic mutation in SUCLG1 (c.626C &gt; A, p.Ala209Glu) heterozygous at the genomic DNA level, but homozygous at the transcriptional level. The patient exhibited early-onset neurometabolic abnormality culminating in severe brain atrophy and dystonia leading to death by the age of 3.5 years. Urine and plasma metabolite profiling was consistent with SUCL deficiency which was confirmed by enzyme analysis and lack of mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation (mSLP) in skin fibroblasts. Oxygen consumption- but not extracellular acidification rates were altered only when using glutamine as a substrate, and this was associated with mild mtDNA depletion and no changes in ETC activities. Immunoblot analysis revealed no detectable levels of SUCLG1, while SUCLA2 and SUCLG2 protein expressions were largely reduced. Confocal imaging of triple immunocytochemistry of skin fibroblasts showed that SUCLG2 co-localized only partially with the mitochondrial network which otherwise exhibited an increase in fragmentation compared to control cells. Our results outline the catastrophic consequences of the mutated SUCLG1 leading to strongly reduced SUCL activity, mSLP impairment, mislocalization of SUCLG2, morphological alterations in mitochondria and clinically to a severe neurometabolic disease, but in the absence of changes in mtDNA levels or respiratory complex activities."	"Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Although environment has undeniable impact, evidence suggests that genetic factors play a significant role in completed suicide. We linked a resource of ~ 4500 DNA samples from completed suicides obtained from the Utah Medical Examiner to genealogical records and medical records data available on over eight million individuals. This linking has resulted in the identification of high-risk extended families (7-9 generations) with significant familial risk of completed suicide. Familial aggregation across distant relatives minimizes effects of shared environment, provides more genetically homogeneous risk groups, and magnifies genetic risks through familial repetition. We analyzed Illumina PsychArray genotypes from suicide cases in 43 high-risk families, identifying 30 distinct shared genomic segments with genome-wide evidence (p = 2.02E-07-1.30E-18) of segregation with completed suicide. The 207 genes implicated by the shared regions provide a focused set of genes for further study; 18 have been previously associated with suicide risk. Although PsychArray variants do not represent exhaustive variation within the 207 genes, we investigated these for specific segregation within the high-risk families, and for association of variants with predicted functional impact in ~ 1300 additional Utah suicides unrelated to the discovery families. None of the limited PsychArray variants explained the high-risk family segregation; sequencing of these regions will be needed to discover segregating risk variants, which may be rarer or regulatory. However, additional association tests yielded four significant PsychArray variants (SP110, rs181058279; AGBL2, rs76215382; SUCLA2, rs121908538; APH1B, rs745918508), raising the likelihood that these genes confer risk of completed suicide."	"Cellular cobalamin defects are a locus and allelic heterogeneous disorder. The gold standard for coming to genetic diagnoses of cobalamin defects has for some time been gene-by-gene Sanger sequencing of individual DNA fragments. Enzymatic and cellular methods are employed before such sequencing to help in the selection of the gene defects to be sought, but this is time-consuming and laborious. Furthermore some cases remain undiagnosed because no biochemical methods have been available to test for cobalamin absorption and transport defects.This paper reports the use of massive parallel sequencing of DNA (exome analysis) for the accurate and rapid genetic diagnosis of cobalamin-related defects in a cohort of affected patients. The method was first validated in an initial cohort with different cobalamin defects. Mendelian segregation, the frequency of mutations, and the comprehensive structural and functional analysis of gene variants, identified disease-causing mutations in 12 genes involved in the absorption and synthesis of active cofactors of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (22 cases), and in the non-cobalamin metabolism-related genes ACSF3 (in four biochemically misdiagnosed patients) and SUCLA2 (in one patient with an unusual presentation). We have identified thirteen new variants all classified as pathogenic according to the ACGM recommendation but four were classified as variant likely pathogenic in MUT and SUCLA2. Functional and structural analysis provided evidences to classify them as pathogenic variants.The present findings suggest that the technology used is sufficiently sensitive and specific, and the results it provides sufficiently reproducible, to recommend its use as a second-tier test after the biochemical detection of cobalamin disorder markers in the first days of life. However, for accurate diagnoses to be made, biochemical and functional tests that allow comprehensive clinical phenotyping are also needed."	"<b>Objective:</b> To analyz the current situation of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of methylmalonic acidemia, the phenotypes, biochemical features and genotypes of the patients in the mainland of China, were investigated. <b>Methods:</b> Tottally 1 003 patients of methylmalonic acidemia from 26 provinces and municipalities of the mainland of China were enrolled. The clinical data, biochemical features and gene mutations were studied. Blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines, urine organic acids, and plasma total homocysteine were determined for the biochemical diagnosis. Gene analyses were performed for the genetic study of 661 patients. The patients were treated with individual intervention and long-term follow up. Prenatal diagnoses were carried out for 165 fetuses of the families. <b>Results:</b> Among 1 003 patients (580 boys and 423 girls), 296 cases (29.5%) had isolated methylmalonic acidemia; 707 cases (70.5%) had combined homocysteinemia; 59 patients (5.9%) were detected by newborn screening; 944 patients (94.1%) had the onset at the ages from several minutes after birth to 25 years and diagnosed at 3 days to 25 years of age. The main clinical presentations were psychomotor retardation and metabolic crisis. Multi-organ damage, including hematological abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, kidney damage, were found. MMACHC, MUT, MMAA, MMAB, HCFC1, SUCLG1, SUCLA2 mutations were found in 631 patients (96.6%) out of 661 patients who accepted gene analysis. MMACHC mutations were detected in 460 patients (94.7%) out of 486 cases of methylmalonic acidemia combined with homocysteinemia. MUT mutations were found in 158 (90.3%) out of 169 cases of isolated methylmalonic acidemia. The development of 59 patients detected by newborn screening were normal; 918 cases (97.2%) were diagnosed after onset accepted the treatment. Forty-five of them completely recovered with normal development. Twenty-six patients (2.7%) died; 873 (92.5%) patients had mild to severe psychomotor retardation. Methylmalonic acidemia were found in 35 out of 165 fetuses by metabolites assay of amniotic fluid and amniocytes gene analysis. <b>Conclusion:</b> Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia is the common type of methylmalonic acidemia in the mainland of China. CblC defect due to MMACHC mutations is the most common type of methylmalonic acidemia combined with homocysteinemia. MUT gene mutations are frequent in the patients with isolated methylmalonic acidemia. Newborn screening is key for the early diagnosis and the better outcome. Combined diagnosis of biochemical assays and gene analysis are reliable for the prenatal diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia."	"Deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme succinyl COA ligase (SUCL) is associated with encephalomyopathic mtDNA depletion syndrome and methylmalonic aciduria. This disorder is caused by mutations in both SUCL subunits genes: SUCLG1 (α subnit) and SUCLA2 (β subnit). We report here, two Tunisian patients belonging to a consanguineous family with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, hearing loss, lactic acidosis, hypotonia, psychomotor retardation and methylmalonic aciduria. Mutational analysis of SUCLG1 gene showed, for the first time, the presence of c.41T &gt; C in the exon 1 at homozygous state. In-silico analysis revealed that this mutation substitutes a conserved methionine residue to a threonine at position 14 (p.M14T) located at the SUCLG1 protein mitochondrial targeting sequence. Moreover, these analysis predicted that this mutation alter stability structure and mitochondrial translocation of the protein. In Addition, a decrease in mtDNA copy number was revealed by real time PCR in the peripheral blood leukocytes in the two patients compared with controls."	"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content measured by different techniques cannot be compared between studies, and age- and tissue-related control values are hardly available. In the present study, we aimed to establish the normal reference range of mtDNA copy number in the Chinese population.Two healthy cohorts of 200 Chinese minors (0.1-18.0 years) and 200 adults (18.0-88.0 years) were recruited. Then, they were further categorized into eight age groups. The absolute mtDNA copy number per cell was measured by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We subsequently used this range to evaluate mtDNA content in four patients (0.5-4.0 years) with molecularly proven mitochondrial depletion syndromes (MDSs) and 83 cases of mitochondrial disease patients harboring the m.3243A&gt;G mutation.The reference range of mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood was 175-602 copies/cell (mean: 325 copies/cell) in minors and 164-500 copies/cell (mean: 287 copies/cell) in adults. There was a decreasing trend in mtDNA copy number in blood with increasing age, especially in 0-2-year-old and &gt;50-year-old donors. The mean mtDNA copy number level among the mitochondrial disease patients with m.3243A&gt;G mutation was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mtDNA content of POLG, DGUOK, TK2, and SUCLA2 genes in blood samples from MDS patients was reduced to 25%, 38%, 32%, and 24%, respectively.We primarily establish the reference intervals of mtDNA copy number, which might contribute to the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of mitochondrial disease."	"Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 5 (MIM 612073) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the beta subunit of the succinate-CoA ligase gene located within the 13q14 band. We describe two siblings of Hispanic descent with SUCLA2-related mitochondrial depletion syndrome (encephalomyopathic form with methylmalonic aciduria); the older sibling is additionally affected with trisomy 21. SUCLA2 sequencing identified homozygous p.Arg284Cys pathogenic variants in both patients. This mutation has previously been identified in four individuals of Italian and Caucasian descent. The older sibling with concomitant disease has a more severe phenotype than what is typically described in patients with either SUCLA2-related mitochondrial depletion syndrome or Down syndrome alone. The younger sibling, who has a normal female chromosome complement, is significantly less affected compared to her brother. While the clinical and molecular findings have been reported in about 50 patients affected with a deficiency of succinate-CoA ligase caused by pathogenic variants in SUCLA2, this report describes the first known individual affected with both a mitochondrial depletion syndrome and trisomy 21."	"Mitochondrial disease was a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases, thus the diagnosis was very difficult to clinicians. Our objective was to analyze clinical and genetic characteristics of children with mitochondrial disease in China. We tested 141 candidate patients who have been suspected of mitochondrial disorders by using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), and summarized the clinical and genetic data of gene confirmed cases from Neurology Department, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2012 to January 2015. In our study, 40 cases of gene confirmed mitochondrial disease including eight kinds of mitochondrial disease, among which Leigh syndrome was identified to be the most common type, followed by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The age-of-onset varies among mitochondrial disease, but early onset was common. All of 40 cases were gene confirmed, among which 25 cases (62.5%) with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation, and 15 cases (37.5%) with nuclear DNA (nDNA) mutation. M.3243A&gt;G (n=7) accounts for a large proportion of mtDNA mutation. The nDNA mutations include SURF1 (n=7), PDHA1 (n=2), and NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, RRM2B, and C12orf65, respectively."	"<i>SUCLA2</i>-related mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with methylmalonic aciduria is characterized by onset of the following features in infancy or childhood (median age of onset 2 months; range of onset birth to 6 years): psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, dystonia, muscular atrophy, sensorineural hearing impairment, postnatal growth retardation, and feeding difficulties. Other, less frequent, features include distinctive facial features, contractures, kyphoscoliosis, gastroesophageal reflux, ptosis, choreoathetosis, ophthalmoplegia, and epilepsy (infantile spasms or generalized convulsions). The median survival is 20 years; approximately 30% of affected individuals succumb during childhood. Affected individuals may have hyperintensities in the basal ganglia, cerebral atrophy, and leukoencephalopathy on head MRI. Elevation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the urine and plasma is found in a vast majority of affected individuals, although at levels that are far below those typically seen in individuals with classic methylmalonic aciduria.The diagnosis of <i>SUCLA2</i>-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is established in a proband by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>SUCLA2</i> on molecular genetic testing.<i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Physical therapy to maintain muscle function and prevent joint contractures; antiepileptic drugs for seizures; nasogastric or gastrostomy tube as needed to assure adequate caloric intake; chest physiotherapy, aggressive antibiotic treatment of chest infections, and respiratory aids such as assisted nasal ventilation or use of a tracheostomy and ventilator when indicated; bracing to treat scoliosis or kyphosis; blepharoplasty for significant ptosis; and hearing aids/cochlear implantation for sensorineural hearing loss. <i>Surveillance:</i> Routine monitoring of development, growth, and hearing; periodic ophthalmologic evaluations; routine skeletal evaluations for kyphoscoliosis and joint contractures.<i>SUCLA2</i>-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible once the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified."	"NF-κB may promote tumor progression by altering cell metabolism. Hence, finding its target genes that are involved in cell metabolism is helpful for understanding its role in tumor growth. Here we discovered four metabolism-related target genes of this transcription factor. By analyzing a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data that characterizing the global binding sites (BSs) of NF-κB RelA in the TNFα-stimulated HeLa cells, we found that four genes that encode core enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, including IDH1, IDH3A, ACO2, and SUCLA2, were multiply bound by this transcription factor. The subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed that the NF-κB BSs contained many canonical κB sequences and the NF-κB-like DNA-binding motifs. Detection of ChIPed DNA with polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-PCR) also indicated that the NF-κB BSs were bound by NF-κB in both TNFα-treated HeLa and HepG2 cells. The reporter construct showed that the NF-κB BSs could activate the luciferase expression in cells in a NF-κB-specific manner. The quantitative PCR and Western blot detections demonstrated that NF-κB could regulate the expressions of IDH1, IDH3A, and ACO2 genes at both mRNA and protein levels and that of SUCLA2 gene at mRNA level in the TNFα-treated HeLa and HepG2 cells. Based on these investigations we identified the four genes as new target genes of NF-κB. The finding provides new insights into the role of NF-κB in cellular energetic metabolism, which may be beneficial for understanding the metabolic physiology of tumor growth."	"The maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depends on a number of nuclear gene-encoded proteins including a battery of enzymes forming the replisome needed to synthesize mtDNA. These enzymes need to be in balanced quantities to function properly that is in part achieved by exchanging intramitochondrial contents through mitochondrial fusion. In addition, mtDNA synthesis requires a balanced supply of nucleotides that is achieved by nucleotide recycling inside the mitochondria and import from the cytosol. Mitochondrial DNA maintenance defects (MDMDs) are a group of diseases caused by pathogenic variants in the nuclear genes involved in mtDNA maintenance resulting in impaired mtDNA synthesis leading to quantitative (mtDNA depletion) and qualitative (multiple mtDNA deletions) defects in mtDNA. Defective mtDNA leads to organ dysfunction due to insufficient mtDNA-encoded protein synthesis, resulting in an inadequate energy production to meet the needs of affected organs. MDMDs are inherited as autosomal recessive or dominant traits, and are associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum ranging from mild adult-onset ophthalmoplegia to severe infantile fatal hepatic failure. To date, pathogenic variants in 20 nuclear genes known to be crucial for mtDNA maintenance have been linked to MDMDs, including genes encoding enzymes of mtDNA replication machinery (POLG, POLG2, TWNK, TFAM, RNASEH1, MGME1, and DNA2), genes encoding proteins that function in maintaining a balanced mitochondrial nucleotide pool (TK2, DGUOK, SUCLG1, SUCLA2, ABAT, RRM2B, TYMP, SLC25A4, AGK, and MPV17), and genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion (OPA1, MFN2, and FBXL4)."

"SURF1"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Mutations in SURFEIT1 (SURF1) genes affect cytochrome c oxidase (COX) levels in different prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In this work, we describe that Arabidopsis thaliana has two genes that potentially encode SURF1 proteins, due to a duplication that took place in Brassicaceae. Both genes encode mitochondrial proteins and mutation of AtSURF1a causes embryonic lethality. Mutation of AtSURF1b, instead, causes defects in hypocotyl elongation under growth stimulating conditions such as low light intensity, increased ambient temperature and incubation with glucose. Mutants in AtSURF1b show reduced expression of the auxin reporter DR5:GUS and increased levels of the gibberellin reporter GFP-RGA, suggesting that auxin and gibberellin homeostasis are affected. In agreement, growth defects caused by AtSURF1b mutation can be overcome by treatment with indole-3-acetic acid and gibberellin A<sub>3</sub> , and also by increasing the expression of the auxin biosynthesis gene YUC8 or the transcription factor PIF4, which shows lower abundance in AtSURF1b deficient plants. Mutants in AtSURF1b display lower COX levels, higher alternative oxidase and superoxide levels, and increased expression of genes that respond to mitochondrial dysfunction. Decreased hypocotyl growth and DR5:GUS expression can be reversed by treatment with reduced glutathione, suggesting that redox changes, probably related to mitochondrial dysfunction, are responsible for the effect of AtSURF1b deficiency on hormone responses. The results indicate that changes in AtSURF1b affect mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species production, which, in turn, impinges on a growth regulatory circuit that involves auxin, gibberellins and the transcription factor PIF4."	"Leigh syndrome (LS), the most common childhood mitochondrial disorder, has characteristic clinical and neuroradiologic features. Mutations in more than 75 genes have been identified in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genome, implicating a high degree of genetic heterogeneity in LS. To profile these genetic signatures and understand the pathophysiology of LS, we recruited 64 patients from 62 families who were clinically diagnosed with LS at Seoul National University Children's Hospital. Mitochondrial genetic analysis followed by whole-exome sequencing was performed on 61 patients. Pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA were identified in 18 families and nuclear DNA mutations in 22. The following 17 genes analyzed in 40 families were found to have genetic complexity: MTATP6, MTND1, MTND3, MTND5, MTND6, MTTK, NDUFS1, NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, SURF1, SLC19A3, ECHS1, PNPT1, IARS2, NARS2, VPS13D, and NAXE. Two treatable cases had biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease, and another three were identified as having defects in the newly recognized genes (VPS13D or NAXE). Variants in the nuclear genes that encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases were present in 27.3% of cases. Our findings expand the genetic and clinical spectrum of LS, showing genetic heterogeneity and highlighting treatable cases and those with novel genetic causes."	"Leigh syndrome is a major phenotype of mitochondrial diseases in children. With new therapeutic options being proposed, assessing the mortality and clinical condition of Leigh syndrome patients is crucial for evaluating therapeutics. As data are scarce in Japan, we analysed the mortality rate and clinical condition of Japanese Leigh syndrome patients that we diagnosed since 2007. Data from 166 Japanese patients diagnosed with Leigh syndrome from 2007 to 2017 were reviewed. Patients' present status, method of ventilation and feeding, and degree of disability as of April 2018 was analysed. Overall, 124 (74.7%) were living, 40 (24.1%) were deceased, and 2 (1.2%) were lost to follow-up. Median age of living patients was 8 years (1-39 years). Median length of disease course was 91 months for living patients and 23.5 months for deceased patients. Nearly 90% of deaths occurred by age 6. Mortality rate of patients with onset before 6 months of age was significantly higher than that of onset after 6 months. All patients with neonatal onset were either deceased or bedridden. MT-ATP6 deficiency caused by m.8993T&gt;G mutation and MT-ND5 deficiency induced a severe form of Leigh syndrome. Patients with NDUFAF6, ECHS1, and SURF1 deficiency had relatively mild symptoms and better survival. The impact of onset age on prognosis varied across the genetic diagnoses. The clinical condition of many patients was poor; however, few did not require mechanical ventilation or tube-feeding and were not physically dependent. Early disease onset and genetic diagnosis may have prognostic value."	"Decreased serum adiponectin levels in type 2 diabetes has been linked to the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic complications by impairing AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling via impaired adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) signaling. Here, we aimed to characterize the previously undefined role of disrupted AdipoR1 signaling on the mitochondrial protein composition of cardiac, renal, and hepatic tissues as three organs principally associated with diabetic complications. Comparative proteomics were performed in mitochondria isolated from the heart, kidneys and liver of <i>Adipor1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. A total of 790, 1,573, and 1,833 proteins were identified in cardiac, renal and hepatic mitochondria, respectively. While 121, 98, and 78 proteins were differentially regulated in cardiac, renal, and hepatic tissue of <i>Adipor</i>1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, respectively; only 15 proteins were regulated in the same direction across all investigated tissues. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed disproportionate representation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation conserved across tissue types. Curated pathway analysis identified HNF4, NRF1, LONP, RICTOR, SURF1, insulin receptor, and PGC-1α as candidate upstream regulators. In high fat-fed non-transgenic mice with obesity and insulin resistance, AdipoR1 gene expression was markedly reduced in heart (-70%), kidney (-80%), and liver (-90%) (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) as compared to low fat-fed mice. NRF1 was the only upstream regulator downregulated both in <i>Adipor</i>1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and in high fat-fed mice, suggesting common mechanisms of regulation. Thus, AdipoR1 signaling regulates mitochondrial protein composition across all investigated tissues in a functionally conserved, yet molecularly distinct, manner. The biological significance and potential implications of impaired AdipoR1 signaling are discussed."	"Uniparental disomy (UPD) leading to autosomal recessive (AR) diseases is rare. We found an unusual homozygous state in two nonconsanguineous families, and only one parent in each family was a heterozygote.Two patients with homozygosity for pathogenic variants were revealed by whole-exome sequencing (WES), further Sanger sequencing found that only one of the parents was a heterozygote. Initial genotype and copy number variations analysis from WES data of probands involving whole chromosomes 1 and 9 containing these two pathogenic variants were performed, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was used to confirm these results.Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous c.3423_3424delTG mutation in AGL in patient 1 and a homozygous c.241-1G&gt;C mutation in SURF1 in patient 2. Further parental testing found that only the two patients' healthy fathers were heterozygous. WES-based copy number and genotype analysis found a copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of whole chromosome 1 in patient 1 and of whole chromosomes 9 and 10 in patient 2. Further genome-wide SNP array and family haplotype analyses confirmed whole paternal uniparental isodisomy (UPiD) 1 in patient 1 and paternal UPiD 9 and maternal UPiD 10 in patient 2. Therefore, UPiD caused AR monogenic glycogen storage disease type-III (GSDIII) in patient 1 and Leigh syndrome in patient 2 through non-Mendelian inheritance of two mutant copies of a gene from each patient's father.Our report highlights that a single NGS-based analysis could allow us to find homozygous sequence variants and copy-neutral LOH in such cases. Our report also describes the first case of GSDIII caused by UPiD 1 and Leigh syndrome caused by UPiD 9."	"Respiration in aerobic Actinobacteria involves a cytochrome bc<sub>1</sub>-aa<sub>3</sub> supercomplex with a diheme cytochrome c<sub>1</sub>, first isolated from Corynebacterium glutamicum. Synthesis of a functional cytochrome c oxidase requires incorporation of Cu<sub>A</sub>, Cu<sub>B</sub>, heme a, and heme a<sub>3</sub>. In contrast to eukaryotes and α-proteobacteria, this process is poorly understood in Actinobacteria. Here, we analyzed the role of a Surf1 homolog of C. glutamicum in the formation of a functional bc<sub>1</sub>-aa<sub>3</sub> supercomplex. Deletion of the surf1 gene (cg2460) in C. glutamicum caused a growth defect and cytochrome spectra revealed reduced levels of cytochrome c and a and an increased level of cytochrome d. Membranes of the Δsurf1 strain had lost the ability to oxidize the artificial electron donor N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, suggesting that Surf1 is essential for the formation of a functional cytochrome aa<sub>3</sub> oxidase. In contrast to the wild type, a bc<sub>1</sub>-aa<sub>3</sub> supercomplex could not be purified from solubilized membranes of the Δsurf1 mutant. A transcriptome comparison revealed that the genes of the SigC regulon including those for cytochrome bd oxidase were upregulated in the Δsurf1 strain as well as the copper deprivation-inducible gene ctiP. Complementation studies showed that the Surf1 homologs of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis could at least partially abolish the growth defect of the C. glutamicum Δsurf1 mutant, suggesting that Surf1 is a conserved assembly factor for actinobacterial cytochrome aa<sub>3</sub> oxidase."	"Mitochondrial disease (MD) is a group of rare inherited disorders with clinical heterogeneous phenotypes. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow for rapid genetic diagnostics in patients who experience MD, resulting in significant strides in determining its etiology. This, however, has not been the case in many patient populations. We report on a molecular diagnostic study using mitochondrial DNA and targeted nuclear DNA (nDNA) NGS of an extensive cohort of predominantly sub-Saharan African pediatric patients with clinical and biochemically defined MD. Patients in this novel cohort presented mostly with muscle involvement (73%). Of the original 212 patients, a muscle respiratory chain deficiency was identified in 127 cases. Genetic analyses were conducted for these 127 cases based on biochemical deficiencies, for both mitochondrial (n = 123) and nDNA using panel-based NGS (n = 86). As a pilot investigation, whole-exome sequencing was performed in a subset of African patients (n = 8). These analyses resulted in the identification of a previously reported pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variant and seven pathogenic or likely pathogenic nDNA variants (ETFDH, SURF1, COQ6, RYR1, STAC3, ALAS2, and TRIOBP), most of which were identified via whole-exome sequencing. This study contributes to knowledge of MD etiology in an understudied, ethnically diverse population; highlights inconsistencies in genotype-phenotype correlations; and proposes future directions for diagnostic approaches in such patient populations."	"Mitochondrial dysfunction activates the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway, resulting in large scale changes in gene expression. Mitochondrial retrograde signaling in neurons is poorly understood and whether retrograde signaling contributes to cellular dysfunction or is protective is unknown. We show that inhibition of Ras-ERK-ETS signaling partially reverses the retrograde transcriptional response to alleviate neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. We have developed a novel genetic screen to identify genes that modify mitochondrial dysfunction in Drosophila. Knock-down of one of the genes identified in this screen, the Ras-ERK-ETS pathway transcription factor Aop, alleviates the damaging effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in the nervous system. Inhibition of Ras-ERK-ETS signaling also restores function in Drosophila models of human diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, Ras-ERK-ETS pathway inhibition partially reverses the mitochondrial retrograde transcriptional response. Therefore, mitochondrial retrograde signaling likely contributes to neuronal dysfunction through mis-regulation of gene expression."	"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been widely reported in AD due to its important role in cellular metabolism and energy production. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase, COX) of mitochondrial electron transport chain, is particularly vulnerable in AD. Defects of COX in AD have been well documented, but there is little evidence to support the genetic association of the COX-related genes with AD. In this study, we investigated the genetic association between 17 nuclear-encoded COX-related genes and AD in 1572 Han Chinese. The whole exons of these genes were also screened in 107 unrelated AD patients with a high probability of hereditarily transmitted AD. Variants in COX6B1, NDUFA4, SURF1, and COX10 were identified to be associated with AD. An integrative analysis with data of eQTL, expression and pathology revealed that most of the COX-related genes were significantly downregulated in AD patients and mouse models, and the AD-associated variants in COX6B1, SURF1, and COX10 were linked to altered mRNA levels in brain tissues. Furthermore, mRNA levels of Ndufa4, Cox5a, Cox10, Cox6b2, Cox7a2, and Lrpprc were significantly correlated with Aβ plaque burden in hippocampus of AD mice. Convergent functional genomics analysis revealed strong supportive evidence for the roles of COX6B1, COX10, NDUFA4, and SURF1 in AD. As the result of our comprehensive analysis of the COX-related genes at the genetic, expression, and pathology levels, we have been able to provide a systematic view for understanding the relationships of the COX-related genes in the pathology of AD."	"SURF1 is an assembly factor of mitochondrial complex IV, and its mutations are the primary cause of Leigh syndrome in infants. To date, over 100 SURF1 mutations have been reported worldwide, but the spectrum of the SURF1 mutations in China remains unclear. Here, using next-generation sequencing targeting mitochondrial protein-coding sequences, we sequenced 178 patients suspected to have mitochondrial diseases. Fifteen SURF1 mutations were identified in 12 Leigh syndrome patients, of which three, c.465_466delAA, c.532A &gt; T, and c.826_827ins AGCATCTGCAGTACATCG, were newly described. The percentage of SURF1 frameshift mutations (6/28, 21.4%) we detected in Chinese population is higher than other studies (21/106, 19.8%) with different populations, however, the percentage of missense mutations is lower in this study than others (4/28, 14.3% VS. 25/106, 23.6%). Since complex IV can be detected in cells carrying missense mutations (3/8) but not in cells carrying null mutations (0/4) by using cell model-based complementation assay, our results indicate that SURF1 mutations may be associated with worse clinical outcome in Chinese patients than other populations. However, studies with larger sample size are needed to verify this conclusion. Additionally, we found that the frameshift mutations resulting in protein truncation closer to the C-terminus are not associated with better disease prognosis. Lastly, we found that determining the levels of complex IV assembly using cell models or lymphocyte analysis rather than invasive muscle and skin fibroblast biopsy, may help predict disease progression in Leigh syndrome patients."	"Leigh syndrome is a progressive early onset neurodegenerative disease typically presenting with psychomotor regression, signs of brainstem and/or basal ganglia disease, lactic acidosis, and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings. At molecular level, deficiency of respiratory complexes and/or pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is usually observed. Nuclear gene SURF1 encodes an assembly factor for cytochrome c-oxidase complex of the respiratory chain and autosomal recessive mutations in SURF1 are one of the most frequent causes of cytochrome c-oxidase-related Leigh syndrome cases. Here, we aimed to elucidate the genetic basis of Leigh syndrome in three Slovak families.Three probands presenting with Leigh syndrome were selected for DNA analysis. The first proband, presenting with atypical LS onset without abnormal basal ganglia magnetic resonance imaging findings, was analyzed with whole exome sequencing. In the two remaining probands, SURF1 was screened by Sanger sequencing. Four different heterozygous mutations were identified in SURF1: c.312_321delinsAT:p.(Pro104Profs*1), c.588+1G&gt;A, c.823_833+7del:p. (?) and c.845_846del:p.(Ser282Cysfs*9). All the mutations are predicted to have a loss-of-function effect.We identified disease-causing mutations in all three probands, which points to the important role of SURF1 gene in etiology of Leigh syndrome in Slovakia. Our data showed that patients with atypical Leigh syndrome phenotype without lesions in basal ganglia may benefit from the whole exome sequencing method. In the case of probands presenting the typical phenotype, Sanger sequencing of the SURF1 gene seems to be an effective method of DNA analysis."	"Loss of SURF1, a Complex IV assembly protein, was reported to increase lifespan in mice despite dramatically lower cytochrome oxidase (COX) activity. Consistent with this, our previous studies found advantageous changes in metabolism (reduced adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial biogenesis) in Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The lack of deleterious phenotypes in Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice is contrary to the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to aging. We found only a modest (nonsignificant) extension of lifespan (7% median, 16% maximum) and no change in healthspan indices in Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> vs. Surf1<sup>+/+</sup> mice despite substantial decreases in COX activity (22%-87% across tissues). Dietary restriction (DR) increased median lifespan in both Surf1<sup>+/+</sup> and Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (36% and 19%, respectively). We measured gene expression, metabolites, and targeted expression of key metabolic proteins in adipose tissue, liver, and brain in Surf1<sup>+/+</sup> and Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Gene expression was differentially regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Many proteins and metabolites are downregulated in Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> adipose tissue and reversed by DR, while in brain, most metabolites that changed were elevated in Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Finally, mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup> )-associated proteins were not uniformly altered by age or genotype, suggesting the UPR<sup>mt</sup> is not a key player in aging or in response to reduced COX activity. While the changes in gene expression and metabolism may represent compensatory responses to mitochondrial stress, the important outcome of this study is that lifespan and healthspan are not compromised in Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that not all mitochondrial deficiencies are a critical determinant of lifespan."	"Leigh syndrome (LS) associated with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is an early onset, fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy, leading to multiple neurological failure and eventually death, usually in the first decade of life. Mutations in SURF1, a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial protein involved in COX assembly, are among the most common causes of LS. LS<sup>SURF1</sup> patients display severe, isolated COX deficiency in all tissues, including cultured fibroblasts and skeletal muscle. Recombinant, constitutive SURF1<sup>-/-</sup> mice show diffuse COX deficiency, but fail to recapitulate the severity of the human clinical phenotype. Pigs are an attractive alternative model for human diseases, because of their size, as well as metabolic, physiological and genetic similarity to humans. Here, we determined the complete sequence of the swine SURF1 gene, disrupted it in pig primary fibroblast cell lines using both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems, before finally generating SURF1<sup>-/-</sup> and SURF1<sup>-/+</sup> pigs by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT). SURF1<sup>-/-</sup> pigs were characterized by failure to thrive, muscle weakness and highly reduced life span with elevated perinatal mortality, compared to heterozygous SURF1<sup>-/+</sup> and wild type littermates. Surprisingly, no obvious COX deficiency was detected in SURF1<sup>-/-</sup> tissues, although histochemical analysis revealed the presence of COX deficiency in jejunum villi and total mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) showed that several COX subunit-encoding genes were significantly down-regulated in SURF1<sup>-/-</sup> skeletal muscles. In addition, neuropathological findings, indicated a delay in central nervous system development of newborn SURF1<sup>-/-</sup> piglets. Our results suggest a broader role of sSURF1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics."	"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder occurring in infancy. The most common clinical signs reported in LS are growth retardation, optic atrophy, ataxia, psychomotor retardation, dystonia, hypotonia, seizures and respiratory disorders. The paper reported a manifestation of 3 Tunisian patients presented with LS syndrome. The aim of this study is the MT[HYPHEN]ATP6 and SURF1 gene screening in Tunisian patients affected with classical Leigh syndrome and the computational investigation of the effect of detected mutations on its structure and functions by clinical and bioinformatics analyses. After clinical investigations, three Tunisian patients were tested for mutations in both MT-ATP6 and SURF1 genes by direct sequencing followed by in silico analyses to predict the effects of sequence variation. The result of mutational analysis revealed the absence of mitochondrial mutations in MT-ATP6 gene and the presence of a known homozygous splice site mutation c.516-517delAG in sibling patients added to the presence of a novel double het mutations in LS patient (c.752-18 A &gt; C/c. c.751 + 16G &gt; A). In silico analyses of theses intronic variations showed that it could alters splicing processes as well as SURF1 protein translation.

"Mitochondrial disease was a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases, thus the diagnosis was very difficult to clinicians. Our objective was to analyze clinical and genetic characteristics of children with mitochondrial disease in China. We tested 141 candidate patients who have been suspected of mitochondrial disorders by using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), and summarized the clinical and genetic data of gene confirmed cases from Neurology Department, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2012 to January 2015. In our study, 40 cases of gene confirmed mitochondrial disease including eight kinds of mitochondrial disease, among which Leigh syndrome was identified to be the most common type, followed by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The age-of-onset varies among mitochondrial disease, but early onset was common. All of 40 cases were gene confirmed, among which 25 cases (62.5%) with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation, and 15 cases (37.5%) with nuclear DNA (nDNA) mutation. M.3243A&gt;G (n=7) accounts for a large proportion of mtDNA mutation. The nDNA mutations include SURF1 (n=7), PDHA1 (n=2), and NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, RRM2B, and C12orf65, respectively."	"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is an essential transmembrane protein complex (Complex IV) in the mitochondrial respiratory electron chain. Mutations in genes responsible for the assembly of COX are associated with Leigh syndrome, cardiomyopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and other fatal metabolic disorders in humans. Previous studies have shown that mice lacking the COX assembly protein Surf1 (Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice) paradoxically show a number of beneficial metabolic phenotypes including increased insulin sensitivity, upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, induction of stress response pathways and increased lifespan. To determine whether these effects are specific to the Surf1 mutation or a more general effect of reduced COX activity, we asked whether a different mutation causing reduced COX activity would have similar molecular and physiologic changes. Sco2 knock-in/knock-out (KI/KO) mice in which one allele of the Sco2 gene that encodes a copper chaperone required for COX activity is deleted and the second allele is mutated, have previously been shown to be viable despite a 30-60% reduction in COX activity. In contrast to the Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we show that Sco2 KI/KO mice have increased fat mass, associated with reduced β-oxidation and increased adipogenesis markers, reduced insulin receptor beta (IR-β levels in adipose tissue, reduced muscle glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) levels and a impaired response to the insulin tolerance test consistent with insulin resistance. COX activity and protein are reduced approximately 50% in adipose tissue from the Sco2 KI/KO mice. Consistent with the increase in adipose tissue mass, the Sco2 KI/KO mice also show increased hepatosteatosis, elevated serum and liver triglyceride and increased serum cholesterol levels compared to wild-type controls. In contrast to the Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which show increased mitochondrial number, upregulation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>MT</sup>) pathway and no significant change in mitochondrial respiration in several tissues, Sco2 KI/KO mice do not upregulate the UPR<sup>MT</sup>, and tissue oxygen consumption and levels of several proteins involved in mitochondrial function are reduced in adipose tissue compared to wild type mice. Thus, the metabolic effects of the Sco2 and Surf1<sup>-/-</sup> mutations are opposite, despite comparable changes in COX activity, illuminating the complex impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on physiology and pointing to an important role for complex IV in regulating metabolism."	"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinically and genetic characteristics of children with Leigh syndrome. <b>Method:</b> Patients with clinically diagnosed Leigh syndrome(LS)in the department of Neurology, Beijing Children's Hospital from January 2013 to February 2016 underwent the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) detecting with next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The clinical data of gene confirmed cases were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The differences in the onset age, clinical manifestations, lactic acid level and MRI results between the mtDNA variation and nDNA variation were compared and analyzed.<i>t</i> test, Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. <b>Result:</b> Thirty-five cases were diagnosed by gene detection, including 20 males and 15 females. The median onset age was 1 year (ranging from the neonatal period to 4.4 years old). The age of onset within 2 years accounted for 74%(26 cases). The onset age of initial symptoms, including developmental delay, developmental regression, and seizures, were 6 (4, 12) months, 12 (8, 14) months, and 6 (1, 23) months respectively. The onset age of ptosis, extrapyramidal symptoms and ataxia were 26 (18, 44) months, 28 (23, 40) months and 28 (19, 35) months, respectively. There were significant differences in the onset age between the three groups (<i>H</i>=21.919, <i>P</i>=0.01). Within the 35 cases, 29 were manifested with developmental delay (83%), 26 with dystonia (74%), 18 with growth retardation, 15 with myasthenia, 13 with developmental regression, 11 with dysphagia, 10 with feeding difficulties, 4 with skeletal dysplasia, and 2 with digestive tract symptoms; nystagmus and respiratory abnormalities were observed in 9 cases respectively; extrapyramidal symptoms, peripheral nerve injury, ptosis, seizures were observed in 8 cases respectively; and ataxia, ophthalmoplegia and hypertrichiasis were found in 5 cases respectively.The blood lactic acid was measured in 32 LS patients, within which 23 cases (72%) had increased results; 8 out of 11 cases who underwent were cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid test had increased results. The results of neuroimaging revealed that all the patients were involved in the brainstem and (or) basal ganglia, of whom 27 (77%) had brainstem involvement, 24 (69%) had basal ganglia involvement. Thirteen out of 14 patients who had medulla oblongata involvement had nDNA variation; while 7 out of 8 patients with cerebellar involvement had nDNA variation. Genetic etiology was confirmed in all patients, among whom there were 17 cases (49%) with mtDNA mutation, including 8993T&gt;C/G (<i>n</i>=5), 14487T&gt;C (<i>n</i>=4), 13513G&gt;A (<i>n</i>=2), 9176T&gt;C, 10158T&gt;C, 3697G&gt;A, 10191T&gt;C, 14459A&gt;G and 11777C&gt;A (<i>n</i>=1) respectively. Remaining 18 cases(51%) had nDNA mutation, including SURF1 gene(<i>n</i>=10), PDHA1 gene(<i>n</i>=3) and one case each of NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, NDUFAF5, NDUFS1 and COQ7 genes. In this study, 27 types of mutations were founded, 15 of which had not been previously reported. Respiratory chain gene mutations have been found in 31 cases(89%); 3 cases had PDHc gene mutations, and 1 case had other mutation. <b>Conclusion:</b> LS usually occurs in infants. The most common primary symptoms are age-dependent abnormal movements, ocular symptoms, and seizures. Respiratory chain defects is the most common causes of LS.SURF1 is the most common variation, followed by 8993T&gt;C/G, 14487 T&gt;C and 13513G&gt;A mutation."	"Defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (CIV) frequently cause encephalocardiomyopathies. Human CIV assembly involves 14 subunits of dual genetic origin and multiple nucleus-encoded ancillary factors. Biogenesis of the mitochondrion-encoded copper/heme-containing COX1 subunit initiates the CIV assembly process. Here, we show that the intermembrane space twin CX<sub>9</sub>C protein CMC1 forms an early CIV assembly intermediate with COX1 and two assembly factors, the cardiomyopathy proteins COA3 and COX14. A TALEN-mediated <i>CMC1</i> knockout HEK293T cell line displayed normal COX1 synthesis but decreased CIV activity owing to the instability of newly synthetized COX1. We demonstrate that CMC1 stabilizes a COX1-COA3-COX14 complex before the incorporation of COX4 and COX5a subunits. Additionally, we show that CMC1 acts independently of CIV assembly factors relevant to COX1 metallation (COX10, COX11, and SURF1) or late stability (MITRAC7). Furthermore, whereas human COX14 and COA3 have been proposed to affect COX1 mRNA translation, our data indicate that CMC1 regulates turnover of newly synthesized COX1 prior to and during COX1 maturation, without affecting the rate of COX1 synthesis."	"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disorders account for a variety of neuromuscular disorders in children. In this study mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes were assayed in muscle tissue in a large cohort of children with varied neuromuscular presentations from June 2011 to December 2013. The biochemical enzyme deficiencies were correlated with the phenotypes, magnetic resonance imaging, histopathology and genetic findings to reach a final diagnosis. There were 85 children (mean age: 6.9±4.7years, M:F:2:1) with respiratory chain enzyme deficiency which included: isolated complex I (n=50, 60%), multiple complexes (n=24, 27%), complex IV (n=8, 9%) and complex III deficiencies (n=3, 4%). The most common neurological findings were ataxia (59%), hypotonia (59%) and involuntary movements (49%). A known mitochondrial syndrome was diagnosed in 27 (29%) and non-syndromic presentations in 57 (71%). Genetic analysis included complete sequencing of mitochondrial genome, SURF1, POLG1&amp;2. It revealed variations in mitochondrial DNA (n=8), SURF1 (n=5), and POLG1 (n=3). This study, the first of its kind from India, highlights the wide range of clinical and imaging phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity in children with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorders."	"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative mitochondrial disorder of infancy. It is a genetically heterogeneous disease. The mutations in SURF1 gene are the most frequently known cause. Here two cases of LS likely caused by SURF1 gene variants are reported: a 39-year-old male patient with a novel homozygous deletion (c.-11_13del), and a case of a 6-year-old boy with the same deletion and a nonsense mutation (c.868dupT), both in heterozygosity. Blue native PAGE showed absence of assembled complex IV. This is the first report of a variant that may abolish the SURF1 gene initiation codon in two LS patients."
"TTC19"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Intramembrane proteolysis, although once a controversial concept, is a widely studied field. Four classes of intramembrane proteases have been identified and are classified by their catalytic mechanism of peptide bond hydrolysis: metallo, glutamyl, aspartyl, and serine proteases. One of the most studied of these classes is the rhomboid superfamily of serine intramembrane proteases. Rhomboids consist of 6 or 7 transmembrane segments that form a helical bundle within the membrane and are involved in a multitude of cellular processes. These proteases are characterized by a catalytic dyad composed of a serine and a histidine residue which distinguishes them from classical serine proteases wherein a catalytic triad is utilized. Of all currently identified rhomboid proteases, one that is of great interest is the mammalian mitochondrial rhomboid protease PARL. Most well-known for its processing of the kinase PINK1 and potential link to Parkinson's disease, PARL has been shown to cleave a variety of substrates within the cell including PGAM5, Smac, TTC19, and others. While recent proteomic studies have provided insight on new potential substrates of PARL, its regulation, activity, and role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis remain largely unknown."	"Mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 2 is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in <i>TTC19</i> gene. <i>TTC19</i> is involved in the preservation of mitochondrial complex III, which is responsible for transfer of electrons from reduced coenzyme Q to cytochrome C and thus, contributes to the formation of electrochemical potential and subsequent ATP generation. Mutations in <i>TTC19</i> have been found to be associated with a wide range of neurological and psychological manifestations. Herein, we report on a 15-year-old boy born from first-degree cousin parents, who initially presented with psychiatric symptoms. He subsequently developed progressive ataxia, spastic paraparesis with involvement of caudate bodies and lentiform nuclei with cerebellar atrophy. Eventually, the patient developed gastrointestinal involvement. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in the <i>TTC19</i> gene in the patient (NM_017775.3, c.581delG: p.Arg194Asnfs<sup>*</sup>16). Advanced genetic sequencing technologies developed in recent years have not only facilitated identification of novel disease genes, but also allowed revelations about novel phenotypes associated with mutations in the genes already linked with other clinical features. Our findings expanded the clinical features of <i>TTC19</i> mutation to potentially include gastrointestinal involvement. Further functional studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."	"The mitochondrial intramembrane rhomboid protease PARL has been implicated in diverse functions in vitro, but its physiological role in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that <i>Parl</i> ablation in mouse causes a necrotizing encephalomyelopathy similar to Leigh syndrome, a mitochondrial disease characterized by disrupted energy production. Mice with conditional PARL deficiency in the nervous system, but not in muscle, develop a similar phenotype as germline <i>Parl</i> KOs, demonstrating the vital role of PARL in neurological homeostasis. Genetic modification of two major PARL substrates, PINK1 and PGAM5, do not modify this severe neurological phenotype. <i>Parl</i><sup>-<i>/</i>-</sup> brain mitochondria are affected by progressive ultrastructural changes and by defects in Complex III (CIII) activity, coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, and mitochondrial calcium metabolism. PARL is necessary for the stable expression of TTC19, which is required for CIII activity, and of COQ4, which is essential in CoQ biosynthesis. Thus, PARL plays a previously overlooked constitutive role in the maintenance of the respiratory chain in the nervous system, and its deficiency causes progressive mitochondrial dysfunction and structural abnormalities leading to neuronal necrosis and Leigh-like syndrome."	"A 7-year-old boy with family history of consanguinity presented with developmental delay and recurrent hemiplegia involving both sides of the body, with variable facial and ocular involvement. Brain MRI showed bilateral striatal necrosis with cystic degeneration and lactate peaks on spectroscopy. Biochemical testing demonstrated mildly elevated lactate and pyruvate. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous pathogenic frameshift mutation in gene TTC19, diagnostic of mitochondrial complex III deficiency."	"Regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain biogenesis is a matter of great interest because of its implications for mitochondrial disease. One of the mitochondrial disease genes recently discovered associated to encephalopathy and mitochondrial complex III (cIII) deficiency is TTC19. Our study of TTC19-deficient human and mouse models, has led us to propose a post-assembly quality control role or 'husbandry' function for this factor that is linked to Rieske Fe-S protein (UQCRFS1). UQCRFS1 is the last incorporated cIII subunit, and its presence is essential for enzymatic activity. During UQCRFS1 assembly, the precursor is cleaved and its N-terminal part remains bound to the complex, between the two core subunits (UQCRC1 and UQCRC2). In the absence of TTC19 there is a prominent accumulation of these UQCRFS1-derived N-terminal fragments that proved to be detrimental for cIII function. In this article we will discuss some ideas around the UQCRFS1 processing and assembly and its importance for the regulation of cIII activity and biogenesis."	"Vertebrate respiratory chain complex III consists of eleven subunits. Mutations in five subunits either mitochondrial (MT-CYB) or nuclear (CYC1, UQCRC2, UQCRB, and UQCRQ) encoded have been reported. Defects in five further factors for assembly (TTC19, UQCC2, and UQCC3) or iron-sulphur cluster loading (BCS1L and LYRM7) cause complex III deficiency. Here, we report a second patient with UQCC2 deficiency. This girl was born prematurely; pregnancy was complicated by intrauterine growth retardation and oligohydramnios. She presented with respiratory distress syndrome, developed epileptic seizures progressing to status epilepticus, and died at day 33. She had profound lactic acidosis and elevated urinary pyruvate. Exome sequencing revealed two homozygous missense variants in <i>UQCC2</i>, leading to a severe reduction of UQCC2 protein. Deficiency of complexes I and III was found enzymatically and on the protein level. A review of the literature on genetically distinct complex III defects revealed that, except TTC19 deficiency, the biochemical pattern was very often a combined respiratory chain deficiency. Besides complex III, typically, complex I was decreased, in some cases complex IV. In accordance with previous observations, the presence of assembled complex III is required for the stability or assembly of complexes I and IV, which might be related to respirasome/supercomplex formation."	"Loss-of-function mutations in TTC19 (tetra-tricopeptide repeat domain 19) have been associated with severe neurological phenotypes and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III deficiency. We previously demonstrated the mitochondrial localization of TTC19 and its link with complex III biogenesis. Here we provide detailed insight into the mechanistic role of TTC19, by investigating a Ttc19<sup>?/?</sup> mouse model that shows progressive neurological and metabolic decline, decreased complex III activity, and increased production of reactive oxygen species. By using both the Ttc19<sup>?/?</sup> mouse model and a range of human cell lines, we demonstrate that TTC19 binds to the fully assembled complex III dimer, i.e., after the incorporation of the iron-sulfur Rieske protein (UQCRFS1). The in situ maturation of UQCRFS1 produces N-terminal polypeptides, which remain bound to holocomplex III. We show that, in normal conditions, these UQCRFS1 fragments are rapidly removed, but when TTC19 is absent they accumulate within complex III, causing its structural and functional impairment."	"Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness. It is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression, often followed by transient or prolonged stabilization or even improvement, but inevitably resulting in eventual progressive neurologic decline, typically occurring in stepwise decrements. Neurologic manifestations include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertrichosis, anemia, renal tubulopathy, liver involvement, ptosis, and muscle weakness. Onset is typically between ages three and 12 months; about 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. Later onset (including in adulthood) and long-term survival may occasionally occur.The diagnosis of nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome is established in individuals with a characteristic clinical presentation, bilateral symmetric T<sub>2</sub>-weighted hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and/or brain stem on brain MRI, elevated lactate in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and either identification of pathogenic variants in a specific nuclear gene or exclusion of mutation of mtDNA. Note: The term &quot;Leigh-like syndrome&quot; is often used when clinical and other features strongly suggest Leigh syndrome but do not fulfill the stringent diagnostic criteria because of atypical or normal neuroimaging, normal blood and CSF lactate levels, atypical neuropathology, and/or incomplete evaluation.Nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome and Leigh-like syndrome are inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked manner.<i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Specific treatment is possible for the three nuclear gene-encoded Leigh-like syndromes: biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD), biotinidase deficiency, and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> deficiency caused by mutation of <i>PDSS2</i>. Supportive care for any of the causes of nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome includes treatment of acidosis, seizures, dystonia, and cardiomyopathy with attention to nutritional status and psychological support for caregivers. <i>Prevention of primary manifestations:</i> Prevention of manifestations is possible for biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD), biotinidase deficiency, and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> deficiency caused by mutation of <i>PDSS2</i>. See <i>Treatment of manifestations</i>. <i>Prevention of secondary complications:</i> Because anesthesia can potentially aggravate respiratory symptoms and precipitate respiratory failure, careful consideration should be given to its use and close monitoring prior to, during, and after its use. <i>Surveillance:</i> Affected individuals should be followed at regular intervals (typically every 6-12 months) to monitor progression and the appearance of new manifestations. Neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and cardiologic evaluations are recommended. <i>Agents/circumstances to avoid:</i> Sodium valproate, barbiturates, and dichloroacetate."	"Molecular analysis of proaerolysin selected glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (GPI-a) deficient isolates in the TK6 cell line was performed. Initial studies found that the expected X-linked PIGA mutations were rare among the spontaneous isolates but did increase modestly after ethyl methane sulfate (EMS) treatment (but to only 50% of isolates). To determine the molecular bases of the remaining GPI-a deficient isolates, real-time analysis for all the 25 autosomal GPI-a pathway genes was performed on the isolates without PIGA mutations, determining that PIGL mRNA was absent for many. Further analysis determined these isolates had several different homozygous deletions of the 5' region of PIGL (17p12-p22) extending 5' (telomeric) through NCOR1 and some into the TTC19 gene (total deletion &gt;250,000 bp). It was determined that the TK6 parent had a hemizygous deletion in 17p12-p22 (275,712 bp) extending from PIGL intron 2 into TTC19 intron 7. Second hit deletions in the other allele in the GPI-a deficient isolates led to the detected homozygous deletions. Several of the deletion breakpoints including the original first hit deletion were sequenced. As strong support for TK6 having a deletion, a number of the isolates without PIGA mutations nor homozygous PIGL deletions had point mutations in the PIGL gene. These studies show that the GPI-a mutation studies using TK6 cell line could be a valuable assay detecting point and deletion mutations in two genes simultaneously."	"Isolated mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III deficiency has been described in a heterogeneous group of clinical presentations in children and adults. It has been associated with mutations in MT-CYB, the only mitochondrial DNA encoded subunit, as well as in nine nuclear genes described thus far: BCS1L, TTC19, UQCRB, UQCRQ, UQCRC2, CYC1, UQCC2, LYRM7, and UQCC3. BCS1L, TTC19, UQCC2, LYRM7, and UQCC3 are complex III assembly factors. We report on an 8-year-old girl born to consanguineous Iraqi parents presenting with slowly progressive encephalomyopathy, severe failure to thrive, significant delays in verbal and communicative skills and bilateral retinal cherry red spots on fundoscopy. SNP array identified multiple regions of homozygosity involving 7.5% of the genome. Mutations in the TTC19 gene are known to cause complex III deficiency and TTC19 was located within the regions of homozygosity. Sequencing of TTC19 revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation at exon 6 (c.937C &gt; T; p.Q313X). We reviewed the phenotypes and genotypes of all 11 patients with TTC19 mutations leading to complex III deficiency (including our case). The consistent features noted are progressive neurodegeneration with Leigh-like brain MRI abnormalities. Significant variability was observed however with the age of symptom onset and rate of disease progression. The bilateral retinal cherry red spots and failure to thrive observed in our patient are unique features, which have not been described, in previously reported patients with TTC19 mutations. Interestingly, all reported TTC19 mutations are nonsense mutations. The severity of clinical manifestations however does not specifically correlate with the residual complex III enzyme activities."	"TTC19 deficiency is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with isolated mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complex III deficiency and loss-of-function mutations in the TT19 gene in the few patients reported so far.We performed exome sequencing and selective mutational analysis of TTC19, respectively, in patients from three unrelated families presenting with initially unspecific clinical signs of muscular hypotonia and global developmental delay followed by regression, ataxia, loss of speech, and rapid neurological deterioration. One patient showed severe lactic acidosis at the neonatal age and during intercurrent illness.We identified homozygous mutations in all three index cases, in two families novel missense mutations (c.544 T &gt; C/p.Leu185Pro; c.917 T &gt; C/p.Leu324Pro). The younger sister of the severely affected patient 3 showed only mild delay of motor skills and muscular hypotonia so far but is also homozygous for the same mutation. Notably, one patient revealed normal activities of MRC complex III in two independent muscle biopsies. Neuroimaging of the severely affected patients demonstrated lesions in putamen and caudate nuclei, cerebellar atrophy, and the unusual finding of hypertrophic olivary nuclei degeneration. Reviewing the literature revealed striking similarities regarding neuroimaging and clinical course in pediatric patients with TTC19 deficiency: patterns consistent with Leigh or Leigh-like syndrome were found in almost all, hypertrophic olivary nucleus degeneration in all patients reported so far. The clinical course in pediatric patients is characterized by an initially unspecific developmental delay, followed by regression, progressive signs and symptoms of cerebellar, basal ganglia and brainstem affection, especially loss of speech and ataxia. Subsequently, neurological deterioration leading to a vegetative state occurs.Our findings add to the phenotypic, genetic, and biochemical spectrum of TTC19 deficiency. However, TTC19 deficient patients do show characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features, which may facilitate diagnosis of this yet rare disorder. Normal MRC complex III activity does not exclude the diagnosis."	"We report about a patient with infantile-onset neurodegenerative disease associated with isolated mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (cIII) deficiency. The boy, now 13 years old, presented with language regression and ataxia at 4 years of age and then showed a progressive course resulting in the loss of autonomous gait and speaking during the following 2 years. Brain MRI disclosed bilateral striatal necrosis. Sequencing of a panel containing nuclear genes associated with cIII deficiency revealed a previously undescribed homozygous rearrangement (c.782_786delinsGAAAAG) in TTC19 gene, which results in a frameshift with premature termination (p.Glu261Glyfs(*)8). TTC19 protein was absent in patient's fibroblasts. TTC19 encodes tetratricopeptide 19, a putative assembly factor for cIII. To date TTC19 mutations have been reported only in few cases, invariably associated with cIII deficiency, but presenting heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. We reviewed the genetic, biochemical, clinical and neuroradiological features of TTC19 mutant patients described to date. "	"Mitochondrial complex III (CIII) deficiency comprises a group of complex and heterogeneous genetic disorders. TTC19 mutations constitute a rare cause of CIII deficiency and are associated with neurological disorders in childhood and adulthood. Herein, we describe a 27-year-old Japanese man with cerebellar ataxia, spastic paraparesis, loss of deep sensation, mild frontal lobe dysfunction and transient psychiatric symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebellar atrophy and bilateral high-intensity signals in the inferior olives and regions adjacent to periaqueductal gray matter, on T2-weighted images. On whole-exome sequencing, we detected a novel homozygous frameshift mutation c.157_158dup [p.Pro54Alafs*48] in TTC19. Mitochondrial enzyme assays confirmed mild impairment of CIII enzymatic activity in lymphoblasts, which was consistent with TTC19-related CIII deficiency. His symptoms and radiological findings demonstrated an early stage or mild form of this disease, and further clarify the characteristics of patients with rare TTC19 mutations. "	"Isolated complex III (cIII) deficiency is a rare biochemical finding in mitochondrial disorders, mainly associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA MTCYB gene, encoding cytochrome b, or in assembly factor genes (BCS1L, TTC19, UQCC2, and LYRM7), whereas mutations in nuclear genes encoding cIII structural subunits are extremely infrequent. We report here a patient, a 9 year old female born from first cousin related parents, with normal development till 18 months when she showed unsteady gait with frequent falling down, cognitive, and speech worsening. Her course deteriorated progressively. Brain MRI showed cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and bilateral lentiform nucleus high signal lesions. Now she is bed ridden with tetraparesis and severely impaired cognitive and language functions. Biochemical analysis revealed isolated cIII deficiency in muscle, and impaired respiration in fibroblasts. We identified a novel homozygous rearrangement in TTC19 (c.213_229dup), resulting in frameshift with creation of a premature termination codon (p.Gln77Argfs*30). Western blot analysis demonstrated the absence of TTC19 protein in patient's fibroblasts, while Blue-Native Gel Electrophoresis analysis revealed the presence of cIII-specific assembly intermediates. Mutations in TTC19 have been rarely associated with mitochondrial disease to date, being described in about ten patients with heterogeneous clinical presentations, ranging from early onset encephalomyopathy to adult forms with cerebellar ataxia. Contrariwise, the biochemical defect was a common hallmark in TTC19 mutant patients, confirming the importance of TTC19 in cIII assembly/stability. Therefore, we suggest extending the TTC19 mutational screening to all patients with cIII deficiency, independently from their phenotypes. "	"Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are heterogeneous diseases characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia associated with dysarthria, oculomotor abnormalities, and mental impairment. To identify the causative gene, we performed exome sequencing on a Japanese patient clinically diagnosed with recessive SCA.The patient is a 37-year-old Japanese woman with consanguineous parents. The head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebellar atrophy and T1 low/T2 high intensity at the bilateral inferior olives. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and next-generation sequencing were performed, and the variants obtained were filtered and prioritized.After these manipulations, we identified a homozygous nonsense mutation of the TTC19 gene (p.Q277*). TTC19 has been reported to be a causative gene of a neurodegenerative disease in Italian and Portuguese families and to be involved in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (cIII) deficiency. This report is the first description of a TTC19 mutation in an Asian population. Clinical symptoms and neuroimaging are consistent with previous reports. The head MRI already showed abnormal features four years before her blood lactate and pyruvate levels were elevated.We should consider the genetic analysis of TTC19 when we observe such characteristic MRI abnormalities. Genes associated with mitochondrial function cause many types of SCAs; the mutation we identified should help to elucidate the pathology of these disorders."	"We report a patient with Leigh syndrome shown to have two previously undescribed truncating mutations in the TTC19 gene. Our patient is a 4-year-old boy with global developmental delay, language regression at 13 months, and brain MRI showing T2 high-signal lesions involving the putamen, caudate body, and the brainstem, which appear to be progressing. Molecular testing showed our patient is heterozygous for two previously undescribed mutations in the TTC19 gene, c.577G&gt;A (p.Trp186Stop) and c.964_967delGGCT (p.Gly322MetfsX8), both of which are predicted to cause loss of protein function due to either protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. TTC19 encodes tetratricopeptide 19 (TTC19) and is thought to be a complex III (CIII) assembly factor that is embedded on the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of two high-molecular-weight complexes, one of which coincides with CIII. The initial presentations of previously described patients with TTC19 mutations are heterogeneous and can be from childhood to adulthood. In summary, TTC19 mutations have been shown to affect CIII complex function, which results in a heterogeneous clinical phenotype including Leigh syndrome. "	"Complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (CIII) catalyzes transfer of electrons from reduced coenzyme Q to cytochrome c. Low biochemical activity of CIII is not a frequent etiology in disorders of oxidative metabolism and is genetically heterogeneous. Recently, mutations in the human tetratricopeptide 19 gene (TTC19) have been involved in the etiology of CIII deficiency through impaired assembly of the holocomplex. We investigated a consanguineous Portuguese family where four siblings had reduced enzymatic activity of CIII in muscle and harbored a novel homozygous mutation in TTC19. The clinical phenotype in the four sibs was consistent with severe olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy, although their age at onset differed slightly. Interestingly, three patients also presented progressive psychosis. The mutation resulted in almost complete absence of TTC19 protein, defective assembly of CIII in muscle, and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species in cultured skin fibroblasts. Our findings add to the array of mutations in TTC19, corroborate the notion of genotype/phenotype variability in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies even within a single family, and indicate that psychiatric manifestations are a further presentation of low CIII."	"Mitochondrial complex III (CIII) deficiency is a relatively rare disease with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. CIII comprises 11 subunits encoded by one mitochondrial and 10 nuclear genes. Abnormalities of the nuclear genes such as BCS1L and TTC19 encoding mitochondrial assembly factors are well known, but an explanation of the majority of CIII deficiency remains elusive. Here, we report three patients from a consanguineous Mexican family presenting with neonatal onset of hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, ketosis, and hyperammonemia. We found a homozygous missense mutation in UQCRC2 that encodes mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein II by whole-exome sequencing combined with linkage analysis. On the basis of structural modeling, the mutation (p.Arg183Trp) was predicted to destabilize the hydrophobic core at the subunit interface of the core protein II homodimer. In vitro studies using fibroblasts from the index patient clearly indicated CIII deficiency, as well as impaired assembly of the supercomplex formed from complexes I, III, and IV. This is the first described human disease caused by a core protein abnormality in mitochondrial CIII."	"Although mutations in CYTB (cytochrome b) or BCS1L have been reported in isolated defects of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (cIII), most cIII-defective individuals remain genetically undefined. We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in the gene encoding tetratricopeptide 19 (TTC19) in individuals from two families affected by progressive encephalopathy associated with profound cIII deficiency and accumulation of cIII-specific assembly intermediates. We later found a second homozygous nonsense mutation in a fourth affected individual. We demonstrated that TTC19 is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of two high-molecular-weight complexes, one of which coincides with cIII. We then showed a physical interaction between TTC19 and cIII by coimmunoprecipitation. We also investigated a Drosophila melanogaster knockout model for TTC19 that showed low fertility, adult-onset locomotor impairment and bang sensitivity, associated with cIII deficiency. TTC19 is a putative cIII assembly factor whose disruption is associated with severe neurological abnormalities in humans and flies."	"Several subunits of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K-III) complex are known as tumour suppressors. Here we uncover a function for this complex and its catalytic product phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) in cytokinesis. We show that PtdIns(3)P localizes to the midbody during cytokinesis and recruits a centrosomal protein, FYVE-CENT (ZFYVE26), and its binding partner TTC19, which in turn interacts with CHMP4B, an endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit implicated in the abscission step of cytokinesis. Translocation of FYVE-CENT and TTC19 from the centrosome to the midbody requires another FYVE-CENT-interacting protein, the microtubule motor KIF13A. Depletion of the VPS34 or Beclin 1 subunits of PI(3)K-III causes cytokinesis arrest and an increased number of binucleate and multinucleate cells, in a similar manner to the depletion of FYVE-CENT, KIF13A or TTC19. These results provide a mechanism for the translocation and docking of a cytokinesis regulatory machinery at the midbody."
"PDHA1"	"Leigh syndrome"	"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder predominantly caused by the dysfunction of pancreatic β‑cells. This dysfunction is partly caused by the dysregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which acts as an important mediator of pyruvate oxidation after glycolysis and fuels the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Previous studies have reported decreased PDH expression in rodent models and humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), suggesting that PDH may play an important role in the development of T2DM. However, the mechanism by which PDH affects insulin secretion and β‑cell development is poorly understood. Using immunofluorescence staining, the present study found that the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1‑α subunit (PDHA1; encoded by the PDHA1 gene) in the islets of type 2 diabetic mice (db/db mice) was lower than in wild‑type mice, which indicated the possible association between PDHA1and diabetes. To further understand this mechanism, an inducible, islet‑specific PDHA1 knockout mouse (βKO) model was established. The phenotype was authenticated, and the blood glucose levels and islet function between the βKO and control mice were compared. Though no changes were found in food intake, development status, fasting blood glucose or weight between the groups, the level of insulin secretion at 30 min after glucose injection in the βKO group was significantly lower compared with the control group. Furthermore, the performed of the βKO mice on the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was visibly impaired when compared with the control mice. Pancreatic tissues were collected for hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical and confocal laser‑scanning microscopy analysis. Examination of the islets from the βKO mouse model indicated that abolishing the expression of PDH caused a compensatory islet enlargement and impaired insulin secretion."	"Perturbations in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism contribute to obesity-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D), though whether alterations in ketone body metabolism influence T2D pathology is unknown. We report here that activity of the rate-limiting enzyme for ketone body oxidation, succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT/Oxct1), is increased in muscles of obese mice. We also found that the diphenylbutylpiperidine pimozide, which is approved to suppress tics in individuals with Tourette syndrome, is a SCOT antagonist. Pimozide treatment reversed obesity-induced hyperglycemia in mice, which was phenocopied in mice with muscle-specific Oxct1/SCOTdeficiency. These actions were dependent on pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH/Pdha1) activity, the rate-limitingenzyme of glucose oxidation, as pimozide failed to alleviate hyperglycemia in obese mice with a muscle-specific Pdha1/PDH deficiency. This work defines a fundamental contribution of enhanced ketone body oxidation to the pathology of obesity-induced T2D, while suggesting pharmacological SCOT inhibition as a new class of anti-diabetes therapy."	"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder partly induced by dysregulation of different brain regions. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysregulation has been reported to associate with mental symptoms such as delusion, apathy, and depression in AD patients. However, the internal mechanisms have not yet been well-understood. This study aims to identify the potential therapeutic target genes and related pathways in PFC of AD. First, differential expression analyses were performed on transcriptome microarray of PFC between AD specimens and non-AD controls. Second, protein-protein interaction networks were constructed based on the identified differentially expressed genes to explore candidate therapeutic target genes. Finally, these candidate genes were validated through biological experiments. The enrichment analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in protein functions and pathways related to AD. Furthermore, the top ten hub genes in the protein-protein interaction network (ELAVL1, CUL3, MAPK6, FBXW11, YWHAE, YWHAZ, GRB2, CLTC, YWHAQ, and PDHA1) were proved to be directly or indirectly related to AD. Besides, six genes (PDHA1, CLTC, YWHAE, MAPK6, YWHAZ, and GRB2) of which were validated to significantly altered in AD mice by biological experiments. Importantly, the most significantly changed gene, PDHA1, was proposed for the first time that may be serve as a target gene in AD treatment. In summary, several genes and pathways that play critical roles in PFC of AD patients have been uncovered, which will provide novel insights on molecular targets for treatment and diagnostic biomarkers of AD."	"Porcine zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs along with global epigenetic remodeling at the 4-cell stage. These processes are regulated by histone acetylation, which requires acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a crucial enzyme in glucose metabolism that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. In mammalian cells, acetyl-CoA is produced by pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 1 (PDHA1) translocated into the nucleus in special conditions. To determine whether zygotic PDHA1 plays a critical role in promoting histone acetylation during ZGA, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system using multiple guide RNAs was employed to generate a PDHA1-targeted parthenogenetic embryo model. Results of immunofluorescent staining showed that the nuclear accumulation of PDHA1 during ZGA was significantly inhibited by PDHA1 targeting. Meanwhile, the 4-cell arrest rate significantly increased at 72 h after activation, indicating impeded embryonic development. In addition, nuclear histone acetylation significantly decreased when PDHA1 was targeted, and quantitative PCR showed that expression of several zygotic genes was significantly decreased in the PDHA1-targeting group compared to the control group. Overexpression of PDHA1 recovered the nuclear PDHA1, H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac and EIF1A expression levels. Moreover, the 5-to-8-cell-stage embryo development rate was only partially rescued. In conclusion, expression of zygotic origin PDHA1 contributes to porcine ZGA by maintaining histone acetylation in porcine embryos."	"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive neoplasm correlated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancers. The alterations in cellular metabolism are important to the survival of HHV8 latently infected cells. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) controls the flux of metabolites between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and is a key enzyme in cancer metabolic reprogramming. Glutaminolysis is required for the survival of PEL cells. Glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) converts glutamate into α-ketoglutarate supplying the TCA cycle with intermediates to support anaplerosis. Previously we have observed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can induce PEL cell death and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) attenuates EGCG induced PEL cell death. In this study, results showed that EGCG upregulated the expression of glucose transporter GLUT3, and reduced the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-alpha (PDHA1), the major regulator of PDH, and GDH1. NAC could partially reverse the effects of EGCG in PEL cells. Overexpression of PDHA1 in PEL cells or supplement of α-ketoglutarate attenuated EGCG induced cell death. EGCG also reduced the levels of oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). These results suggest that EGCG may modulate the metabolism of PEL cells leading to cell death."	"One of the remarkable metabolic characteristics of cancer cells is that they prefer glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit (PDHA1) is an important prerequisite for OXPHOS. Our previous studies have shown that low level of PDHA1 protein expression in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) was correlated with poor prognosis. However, the effect of PDHA1 inhibition on metabolism and biological behavior of esophageal cancer cells remains unclear.In this study, a KYSE450 PDHA1 knockout (KO) cell line of esophageal cancer was established by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Then, the glycose metabolism, cell proliferation and migration abilities, chemotherapeutic tolerance and angiogenesis of the PDHA1 KO cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo. In the PDHA1 KO cells, the glycolysis and the consumption of glucose and glutamine were significantly enhanced, while the OXPHOS was significantly suppressed, implying Warburg effect in the PDHA1 KO cells. Furthermore, it was also proved in vitro experiments that the PDHA1 KO cell obtained proliferation advantage, as well as significantly greater chemotherapy tolerance and migration ability. Xenograft experiments discovered not only larger tumors but also increased angiogenesis in the PDHA1 KO cell group.Inhibition of <i>PDHA1</i> gene expression in human ESCC leads to metabolic reprogramming of Warburg effect and increased malignancies. Targeting ESCC metabolic reprogramming may become a potential therapeutic target."	"Hyperpolarized (HP) <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate MRI is a stable-isotope molecular imaging modality that provides real-time assessment of the rate of metabolism through glycolytic pathways in human prostate cancer. Heretofore this imaging modality has been successfully utilized in prostate cancer only in localized disease. This pilot clinical study investigated the feasibility and imaging performance of HP <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate MR metabolic imaging in prostate cancer patients with metastases to the bone and/or viscera.Six patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were recruited. Carbon-13 MR examination were conducted on a clinical 3T MRI following injection of 250 mM hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate, where pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate (k<sub>PL</sub>) was calculated. Paired metastatic tumor biopsy was performed with histopathological and RNA-seq analyses.We observed a high rate of glycolytic metabolism in prostate cancer metastases, with a mean k<sub>PL</sub> value of 0.020 ± 0.006 (s<sup>-1</sup>) and 0.026 ± 0.000 (s<sup>-1</sup>) in bone (N = 4) and liver (N = 2) metastases, respectively. Overall, high k<sub>PL</sub> showed concordance with biopsy-confirmed high-grade prostate cancer including neuroendocrine differentiation in one case. Interval decrease of k<sub>PL</sub> from 0.026 at baseline to 0.015 (s<sup>-1</sup>) was observed in a liver metastasis 2 months after the initiation of taxane plus platinum chemotherapy. RNA-seq found higher levels of the lactate dehydrogenase isoform A (Ldha,15.7 ± 0.7) expression relative to the dominant isoform of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdha1, 12.8 ± 0.9).HP <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate MRI can detect real-time glycolytic metabolism within prostate cancer metastases, and can measure changes in quantitative k<sub>PL</sub> values following treatment response at early time points. This first feasibility study supports future clinical studies of HP <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate MRI in the setting of advanced prostate cancer."	"Water temperature can affect the metabolism of fish. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a representative eurythermic fish that can survive at a wide range of ambient temperatures, allowing it to live in an extensive geographical range. The goal of this work was to study the glucose metabolism of common carp at different temperatures and determine the miRNAs involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. We determined the indicators related to glucose metabolism after long-term temperature stress and constructed nine small RNA libraries of livers under different temperature stress (5 °C, 17 °C, and 30 °C, with three biological replicates for each temperature), and subjected these samples to high-throughput sequencing. A positive relationship was observed between weight gain rate (WGR) and temperature increase after 18 days of temperature stress. However, the glucose level in the plasma maintained a gentle decrease. Unexpectedly, liver lactic acid levels were elevated in HTG (high temperature group) and LTG (low temperature group). Six down-regulated miRNAs (miR-122, miR-30b, miR-15b-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-1, and miR-7b) were identified as involved in the regulation of glycolysis. Twelve genes were predicted as targets of these miRNAs, and these genes are in pathways related to pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle). The results allowed prediction of a potential regulatory network of miRNAs involved in the regulation of glycolysis. The target genes of six down-regulated miRNAs were up-regulated under temperature stress, including Aldolase C, fructose-bisphosphate, b (ALDOCB), multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (MINPP1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 (PDHA1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1a (ALDH9A1A), Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACSS), lactate dehydrogenase b (LDH-b), and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR). Other key genes of glycolysis, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), pyruvate kinase PKM (PKM), and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) were significantly up-regulated in LTG and HTG. Overall, the results suggest that miRNAs maintain their energy requirements by regulating glycolysis and play an important role in the molecular response to cold and heat stress of common carp. These data provide the foundation for further studies of the role of miRNAs in environmental adaptation in fish."	"Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency caused by mutations in the X-linked PDHA1 gene has a broad clinical presentation, and the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation has been proposed as a major factor contributing to its variable expressivity in heterozygous females. Here, we report the first set of monozygotic twin females with PDC deficiency, caused by a novel, de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 11 of PDHA1 (NM_000284.3: c.1100A&gt;T). Both twins presented in infancy with a similar clinical phenotype including developmental delay, episodes of hypotonia or encephalopathy, epilepsy, and slowly progressive motor impairment due to pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and cerebellar involvement. However, they exhibited clear differences in disease severity that correlated well with residual PDC activities (approximately 60% and 20% of mean control values, respectively) and levels of immunoreactive E1α subunit in cultured skin fibroblasts. To address whether the observed clinical and biochemical differences could be explained by the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, we undertook an androgen receptor assay in peripheral blood. In the less severely affected twin, a significant bias in the relative activity of the two X chromosomes with a ratio of approximately 75:25 was detected, while the ratio was close to 50:50 in the other twin. Although it may be difficult to extrapolate these results to other tissues, our observation provides further support to the hypothesis that the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation may influence the phenotypic expression of the same mutation in heterozygous females and broadens the clinical and genetic spectrum of PDC deficiency."	"<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinical and genetic characteristics of children with mitochondrial epilepsy. <b>Methods:</b> Clinical data of 62 children who were clinically and genetically diagnosed with mitochondrial epilepsy by the Department of Neurology, Beijing Children's Hospital from October 2011 to December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively, and the control of epilepsy was followed up. <i>T</i> test or χ(2) test were used to analyze the related factors affecting the prognosis of epilepsy between the effective group and the ineffective group. <b>Results:</b> Of the 62 patients, 33 were male and 29 were female. The age of onset was 3.38 (0-12.00) years; for the type of seizures, 68% (42/62) of the patients had focal seizures, generalized or secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures were seen in 32% (20/62), myoclonic seizures in 23% (14/62), spastic seizures in 7 cases, tonic seizures in 4 cases, absence seizure, atonic seizure and clonic seizure in 1 case each; 16 cases (26%) had status epilepticus, of whom 6 cases had epilepsia partialis continua; 52% (32/62) had 2 or more types of seizures. The clinical phenotypes were mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in 29 cases, Leigh syndrome (LS) in 11 cases, combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency in 6 cases, myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers in 5 cases, Alpers syndrome in 4 cases, pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 and mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 9 in 2 cases each, mitochondrial complex Ⅰ deficiency nuclear type 20, progressive cavitating leukoencephalopathy, and biotinidase deficiency in 1 case each. Of the 62 cases, 40 cases (65%) had mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations, of which 26 cases had m.3243A&gt;G variants, 6 cases had m.8344A&gt;G variants, and 3 cases had m.8993T&gt;G/C variants, m.3271T&gt;C, m.3481G&gt;A, m.3946G&gt;A, m.13094T&gt;C, m.14487T&gt;C variant was in 1 case each; nuclear DNA (nDNA) variations were identified in 22 cases (35%), of which 7 cases carrying variations in mitochondrial ammonia acyl tRNA synthetase coding gene, mutations in POLG and the gene encoding complex Ⅰ were in 4 cases each, variations in SUCLG1 and SDHA genes were in 2 cases each, and variations in PDHA1, BTD and TRIT1 genes were in 1 case each. Forty-three patients were followed up, and the follow-up time was 20 (3-84) months. According to the follow-up results, the anti-epilepsy treatment was effective in 19 cases (44%) and ineffective in other 24 cases (56%). The onset age of the effective group was 3.42 (0-11.50) years and that of the ineffective group was 0.92 (0-9.50) years. The onset duration of the effective group was 0 (0-7.00) years and that of the ineffective group was 0 (0-4.83) years. There was no significant difference between the effective group and the ineffective group (<i>t=</i>1.662, 0.860; <i>P=</i>0.104, 0.395). In the effective group and the ineffective group, 12 cases and 9 cases used less than 2 kinds of antiepileptic drugs, 7 cases and 15 cases used more than or equal to 2 kinds of antiepileptic drugs, 13 and 15 cases had first epilepsy, 6 and 9 cases had non-first epilepsy, 14 and 11 cases had mtDNA variation, 5 and 13 cases had nDNA variation, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups (χ(2)=2.794, 0.164, 3.380; <i>P=</i>0.095, 0.686, 0.066). <b>Conclusions:</b> The types of seizures with mitochondrial epilepsy in children varied, with focal motor seizures being the most common, followed by generalized or secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Most children have more than two types of seizures. MELAS is the most common clinical phenotype, followed by LS; mtDNA variation is the dominant gene variation, of which m.3243A&gt;G variation is the most common hotspot variation, followed by gene variation encoding mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthase."	"Ηeat and calcium treatments reprogram sweet cherry fruit metabolism during postharvest senescence as evidenced by changes in respiration, amino acid metabolism, sugars, and secondary metabolites shift. Heat and calcium treatments are used to improve postharvest fruit longevity; however, the exact mechanism remains poorly understood. To characterize the impact of these treatments on sweet cherries metabolism, 'Lapins' fruits were treated with heat or CaCl<sub>2</sub> solutions and their combination and subsequently were exposed at room temperature, for up to 4 days, defined as senescence period. Single and combined heat and calcium treatments partially delayed fruit senescence, as evidenced by changes in fruit colour darkening, skin penetration force, and respiration activity. Calcium content was noticeably increased by heat in Ca-treated fruit. Several primary metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids, and alcohols, were decreased in response to both treatments, while many soluble sugars and secondary metabolites were increased within 1 day post-treatment. Changes of several metabolites in heat-treated fruits, especially esculetin, peonidin 3-O-glucoside and peonidin 3-O-galactoside, ribose, pyroglutamate, and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, were detected. The metabolome of fruit exposed to calcium also displayed substantial modulations, particularly in the levels of galactose, glycerate, aspartate, tryptophan, phospharate rutin, and peonidin 3-O-glucoside. The expression of several genes involved in TCA cycle (MDH1, IDH1, OGDH, SUCLA2, and SDH1-1), pectin degradation (ADPG1) as well as secondary (SK1, 4CL1, HCT, and BAN), amino acids (ALDH18A1, ALDH4A1, GS, GAD, GOT2, OPLAH, HSDH, and SDS), and sugar (PDHA1 and DLAT) metabolism were affected by both treatments. Pathway-specific analysis further revealed the regulation of fruit metabolic programming by heat and calcium. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of metabolic regulation in response to heat and calcium during fruit senescence."	"During sprouting angiogenesis, an individual endothelial tip cell grows out from a pre-existing vascular network and guides following and proliferating stalk cells to form a new vessel. Metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration as the major sources of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) for energy production are differentially activated in these types of endothelial cells (ECs) during angiogenesis. Therefore, we studied energy metabolism during angiogenesis in more detail in tip cell and non-tip cell human umbilical vein ECs. Small interfering RNA was used to inhibit transcription of glycolytic enzymes PFKFB3 or LDHA and mitochondrial enzyme PDHA1 to test whether inhibition of these specific pathways affects tip cell differentiation and sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We show that glycolysis is essential for tip cell differentiation, whereas both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration occur during proliferation of non-tip cells and in sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration causes adaptation of EC metabolism by increasing glycolysis and vice versa. In conclusion, our studies show a complex but flexible role of the different metabolic pathways to produce ATP in the regulation of tip cell and non-tip cell differentiation and functioning during sprouting angiogenesis."	"Previous study indicated that Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a central regulator of adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we investigate the role of SIRT3 in the modulation of cellular phenotype in BAT under high salt intake (HS). HS downregulated SIRT3 level in BAT, accompanied by decreased oxygen consumption rate, and caused a severe loss of BAT characteristics. Mechanically, SIRT3 interacted with pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α (PDHA1) and deacetylated Lys-83 both in vitro and in vivo under HS. In parallel, HS suppressed salt-induced kinase (Sik) 2 phosphorylation. Silencing Sik2 further diminished SIRT3 activity and enhanced acetylation of PDHA1 K83 level. Reconstruction of SIRT3 restored PDH activity and thermogenic markers expression in differentiated brown adipocytes from SIRT3 knockout (KO) mice. In addition, loss of SIRT3 induced selective remodelling of phospholipids and glycerolipids in BAT exposure to HS. These data indicate that SIRT3 is an essential enzymatic switch that controls brown adipose cell phenotype."	"Tumor cells rely heavily on glycolysis regardless of oxygen tension, a phenomenon called the Warburg effect. Hexokinase II (HKII) catalyzes the first irreversible step of glycolysis and is often overexpressed in tumor cells. Mitochondrial HKII couples glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation while maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity. In this study, we investigated the role of HKII in promoting the Warburg effect in cancer cells.HKII-mediated phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1) was tested in HEK293T cells and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) specimens using gene knockdown, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.It was determined that HKII could not only transform glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, but also transfer the phosphate group of ATP onto PDHA1. In addition, it was found that HKII increased the phosphorylation of Ser293 on PDHA1, decreasing pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex activity and thus rerouting the metabolic pathway and promoting the Warburg effect. The overexpression of HKII correlated with the phosphorylation of PDHA1 and disease progression in ccRCC.The data presented here suggest that HKII is an important biomarker in the evaluation and treatment of cancer."	"Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder associated with abnormal mitochondrial metabolism. Structural brain abnormalities are common in PDCD. A case of a patient with PDCD with an unusual presentation is described. A 20-month-old boy with hypotonia and developmental delay, presented with hypoxia and respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis. During hospitalisation, he was prescribed PediaSure® feeds. Two days after starting these feeds, he developed respiratory arrest requiring intubation. His blood gas before arrest revealed lactate of 8.9 mmol/L despite normal haemodynamics. After stabilisation and a period of compulsory fasting, subsequent feeding with PediaSure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis. A metabolic workup revealed an elevated serum pyruvate level. Brain MRI was normal. Skeletal muscle biopsy confirmed PDCD. The most common cause of PDCD is a mutation in the X-linked PDHA1 gene. The severity of PDCD can range from neonatal death to more delayed onset of symptoms as in our index case. Normal brain MRI is reported in only 2% of patients with PDCD. There is no effective treatment for PDCD. In patients with proximal muscle weakness and feeding intolerance with glucose-containing feeds, the presence of lactic acidosis should raise the suspicion of PDCD irrespective of the patient's age and normal MRI."	"Even with increasing evidence for roles of glycolytic enzymes in controlling cancerous characteristics, the best target of candidate metabolic enzymes for lessening malignancy remains under debate. Pyruvate is a main glycolytic metabolite that could be mainly converted into either lactate by Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA) or acetyl-CoA by Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 component α subunit (PDHA1) catalytic complex. In tumor cells, accumulating lactate is produced whereas the conversion of pyruvate into mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is less active compared with their normal counterparts. This reciprocal molecular association makes pyruvate metabolism a potential choice of anti-cancer target. Cellular and molecular changes were herein assayed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) cells in response to LDHA and PDHA1 loss in vitro, in vivo and in clinic. By using various human cancer databases and clinical samples, LDHA and PDHA1 levels exhibit reversed prognostic roles. In vitro analysis demonstrated that decreased cell growth and motility accompanied by an increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was found in cells with LDHA loss whereas PDHA1-silencing exhibited opposite phenotypes. At the molecular level, it was found that oncogenic Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) singling pathways contribute to pyruvate metabolism mediated HNSCC cell growth. Furthermore, LDHA/PDHA1 changes in HNSCC cells resulted in a broad metabolic reprogramming while intracellular molecules including polyunsaturated fatty acids and nitrogen metabolism related metabolites underlie the malignant changes. Collectively, our findings reveal the significance of pyruvate metabolic fates in modulating HNSCC tumorigenesis and highlight the impact of metabolic plasticity in HNSCC cells."	"Cerebral energy deficiency is a key pathophysiologic cascade that results in neuronal injury and necrosis after ischemic stroke. Shengui Sansheng San (SSS) has been used to treat stroke for more than 300 years. In present study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of SSS extraction on cerebral energy deficiency post-stroke. In permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo) model of rats, it suggested that SSS extraction in dose-dependent manner improved neurological function, cerebral blood flow (CBF), <sup>18</sup>F-2-deoxy-glucose uptake and the density and diameter of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive vasculature in ipsilateral area, as well as decreased infarcted volume. Meanwhile, the metabolomics study in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed by using 5-(diisopropylamino)amylamine (DIAAA) derivatization-UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS approach. Eighty-eight endogenous metabolites were identified, and mainly involved in citrate cycle, fatty acid biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, amino acids metabolism and biosynthesis, etc. The remarkable increase of citrate in CSF after treatment with three dosages indicated that the therapeutic mechanism of SSS extraction might be related with citrate cycle. Simultaneously, it showed that high dosage group significantly increased peripheral blood glucose level, the expressions of glucose transporter (GLUT) 1, GLUT3, and monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1), which contributed to the transportation of glucose and lactate. By the regulations of phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-alpha (p-PDHA1), acetyl CoA synthetase and citrate synthetase (CS), the levels of citrate and its upstream molecules (pyruvate and acetyl CoA) in peri-infarction zone further enhanced, which ultimately caused the massive yield of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Our study first demonstrated that SSS extraction could ameliorate cerebral energy deficiency after ischemia by citrate cycle, which is characterized by the enhancements of glucose supply, transportation, utilization, and metabolism."	"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an extremely invasive malignancy with late diagnosis and unfavorable prognosis. Surgery and chemotherapy are still not effective in improving outcomes in CCA patients. It is crucial to explore a novel therapeutic target for treating CCA. An NAD-dependent deacetylase also known as Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) has been shown to regulate cellular metabolism in various cancers dynamically. However, the biological function of SIRT3 in CCA remains unclear. In this study, bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes and pathways enriched. CCA samples were collected for immunohistochemical analysis. Three human CCA cell lines (HuCCT1, RBE, and HCCC9810) were used to explore the molecular mechanism of SIRT3 regulation of metabolic reprogramming and malignant behavior in CCA. A CCA xenograft model was then established for further validation in vivo. The data showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and glycolysis was enhanced in CCA. Similar metabolic reprogramming was also observed in SIRT3 knockout mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SIRT3 could play an anti-Warburg effect by inhibiting the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α)/pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1)/pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1) pathway in CCA cells. CCA cell proliferation and apoptosis were regulated by SIRT3-mediated metabolic reprogramming. These findings were further confirmed in CCA clinical samples and the xenograft model. Collectively, this study suggests that in the inhibition of CCA progression, SIRT3 acts through an anti-Warburg effect on the downstream pathway HIF1α/PDK1/PDHA1."	"Non-progressive genetic disorders may present with motor dysfunction resembling cerebral palsy (CP). Such patients are often characterized as CP mimics. The purpose of this work was to delineate the clinical manifestations and molecular findings of CP mimic patients, with the ultimate goal to offer specific disease-modifying therapy and genetic counseling.Retrospective study of 47 patients diagnosed with CP and no acquired etiology. Chart review of clinical, neuroradiological, biochemical and molecular data was performed.31,91% of patients manifested with features resembling dyskinetic CP, 19,14% spastic CP, 10,63% ataxic CP and 38,30% mixed CP. In 23 patients molecular diagnosis was reached and included 5 hereditary spastic paraplegia genes (SPG) in spastic CP mimics; HPRT1, TH, QDPR, DDC in dystonic CP mimics; ADCY5 and NIKX2-1 in choreic CP mimics; CANA1A in ataxic CP mimics; and SPG, PDHA1, NIKX2-1, AT, SLC2A1 and SPR in mixed CP mimics. In 14 patients, the etiological diagnosis led to specific treatment.CP mimics show a number of features that differ from classic CP and can be used as diagnostic clues, including presence of mixed motor features, minor dysmorphic features, oculogyric movements, multiple features of autonomic dysfunction, and acquired microcephaly. A more stringent use of the concept of CP focused on acquired lesions during the perinatal and infancy periods, and excluding disorders that could be of genetic origin, could contribute to a purer use of the term. Identification of a specific genetic cause for CP mimics may in certain cases lead to etiologic treatment."	"Notwithstanding the numerous drugs available for liver cancer, emerging evidence suggests that chemotherapeutic resistance is a significant issue. HGF and its receptor MET play critical roles in liver carcinogenesis and metastasis, mainly dependent on the activity of receptor tyrosine kinase. However, for unknown reasons, all HGF-MET kinase activity-targeted drugs have failed or have been suspended in clinical trials thus far. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a protective 'self-eating' process for resisting metabolic stress by recycling obsolete components, whereas the impact of autophagy-mediated reprogrammed metabolism on therapeutic resistance is largely unclear, especially in liver cancer. In the present study, we first observed that HGF stimulus facilitated the Warburg effect and glutaminolysis to promote biogenesis in multiple liver cancer cells. We then identified the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and GLS/GLS1 as crucial substrates of HGF-activated MET kinase; MET-mediated phosphorylation inhibits PDHC activity but activates GLS to promote cancer cell metabolism and biogenesis. We further found that the key residues of kinase activity in MET (Y1234/1235) also constitute a conserved LC3-interacting region motif (Y1234-Y1235-x-V1237). Therefore, on inhibiting HGF-mediated MET kinase activation, Y1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET induced autophagy to maintain biogenesis for cancer cell survival. Moreover, we verified that Y1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET correlated with autophagy in clinical liver cancer. Finally, a combination of MET inhibitor and autophagy suppressor significantly improved the therapeutic efficiency of liver cancer <i>in vitro</i> and in mice. Together, our findings reveal an HGF-MET axis-coordinated functional interaction between tyrosine kinase signaling and autophagy, and establish a MET-autophagy double-targeted strategy to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in liver cancer. <b>Abbreviations:</b> ALDO: aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate; CQ: chloroquine; DLAT/PDCE2: dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; ENO: enolase; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLS/GLS1: glutaminase; GLUL/GS: glutamine-ammonia ligase; GPI/PGI: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; HGF: hepatocyte growth factor; HK: hexokinase; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LIHC: liver hepatocellular carcinoma; LIR: LC3-interacting region; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDHA1: pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 subunit; PDHX: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component X; PFK: phosphofructokinase; PK: pyruvate kinase; RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas."
"ACTC1"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"The microgravity conditions of prolonged spaceflight are known to result in skeletal muscle atrophy that leads to diminished functional performance. To assess if inhibition of the growth factor myostatin has potential to reverse these effects, mice were treated with a myostatin antibody while housed on the International Space Station. Grip strength of ground control mice increased 3.1% compared to baseline values over the 6 weeks of the study, whereas grip strength measured for the first time in space showed flight animals to be -7.8% decreased in strength compared to baseline values. Control mice in space exhibited, compared to ground-based controls, a smaller increase in DEXA-measured muscle mass (+3.9% vs +5.6% respectively) although the difference was not significant. All individual flight limb muscles analyzed (except for the EDL) weighed significantly less than their ground counterparts at the study end (range -4.4% to -28.4%). Treatment with myostatin antibody YN41 was able to prevent many of these space-induced muscle changes. YN41 was able to block the reduction in muscle grip strength caused by spaceflight and was able to significantly increase the weight of all muscles of flight mice (apart from the EDL). Muscles of YN41-treated flight mice weighed as much as muscles from Ground IgG mice, with the exception of the soleus, demonstrating the ability to prevent spaceflight-induced atrophy. Muscle gene expression analysis demonstrated significant effects of microgravity and myostatin inhibition on many genes. Gamt and Actc1 gene expression was modulated by microgravity and YN41 in opposing directions. Myostatin inhibition did not overcome the significant reduction of microgravity on femoral BMD nor did it increase femoral or vertebral BMD in ground control mice. In summary, myostatin inhibition may be an effective countermeasure to detrimental consequences of skeletal muscle under microgravity conditions."	"Emerging evidence demonstrates that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis has played a role in molecular biological mechanisms of cancer occurrence and development. But the effect of ceRNA network in bladder cancer (BC), especially lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of BC, was not completely expounded. By means of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we compared the expression of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data between 19 normal bladder tissue and 414 primary bladder tumours. Then, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to analyse the correlation between two sets of genes with traits. Interactions between miRNAs, lncRNAs and target mRNAs were predicted by MiRcode, miRDB, starBase, miRTarBase and TargetScan. Next, by univariate Cox regression and LASSO regression analysis, the 86 mRNAs obtained by prediction were used to construct a prognostic model which contained 4 mRNAs (ACTC1 + FAM129A + OSBPL10 + EPHA2). Then, by the 4 mRNAs in the prognostic model, a ceRNA regulatory network with 48 lncRNAs, 14 miRNAs and 4 mRNAs was constructed. To sum up, the ceRNA network can further explore gene regulation and predict the prognosis of BC patients."	"This research communication describes a genome-wide association study for Italian buffalo mammary gland morphology. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (AX-85117983, AX-8509475 and AX-85117518) were identified to be significantly associated with buffalo anterior teat length, posterior teat length and distance between anterior and posterior teat, respectively. Two significant signals for buffalo mammary gland morphology were observed in two genomic regions on the chromosome 10, and chromosome 20. One of the regions located on the chromosome 10 has the most likely candidate genes ACTC1 and GJD2, both of which have putative roles in the regulation of mammary gland development. This study provides new insights into the genetic variants of buffalo mammary gland morphology and may be beneficial for understanding of the genetic regulation of mammary growth."	"High-quality chicken meat is an important source of animal protein for humans. Gene expression profiles in breast muscle tissue were determined, aiming to explore the common regulatory genes relevant to muscle and intramuscular fat (IMF) during the developmental stage in chickens. Results show that breast muscle weight (BMW), breast meat percentage (BMP, %), and IMF (%) continuously increased with development. A total of 256 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the developmental stage were screened. Among them, some genes related to muscle fiber hypertrophy were upregulated (e.g., CSRP3, LMOD2, MUSTN1, MYBPC1), but others (e.g., ACTC1, MYL1, MYL4) were downregulated from Week 3 to Week 18. During this period, expression of some DEGs related to the cells cycle (e.g., CCNB3, CCNE2, CDC20, MCM2) changed in a way that genetically suggests possible inhibitory regulation on cells number. In addition, DEGs associated with energy metabolism (e.g., ACOT9, CETP, LPIN1, DGAT2, RBP7, FBP1, PHKA1) were found to regulate IMF deposition. Our data identified and provide new insights into the common regulatory genes related to muscle growth, cell proliferation, and energy metabolism at the developmental stage in chickens."	"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is genetically heterogeneous, with &gt;100 purported disease genes tested in clinical laboratories. However, many genes were originally identified based on candidate-gene studies that did not adequately account for background population variation. Here we define the frequency of rare variation in 2538 patients with DCM across protein-coding regions of 56 commonly tested genes and compare this to both 912 confirmed healthy controls and a reference population of 60 706 individuals to identify clinically interpretable genes robustly associated with dominant monogenic DCM.We used the TruSight Cardio sequencing panel to evaluate the burden of rare variants in 56 putative DCM genes in 1040 patients with DCM and 912 healthy volunteers processed with identical sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines. We further aggregated data from 1498 patients with DCM sequenced in diagnostic laboratories and the Exome Aggregation Consortium database for replication and meta-analysis.Truncating variants in <i>TTN</i> and <i>DSP</i> were associated with DCM in all comparisons. Variants in <i>MYH7, LMNA, BAG3, TNNT2, TNNC1, PLN, ACTC1, NEXN, TPM1</i>, and <i>VCL</i> were significantly enriched in specific patient subsets, with the last 2 genes potentially contributing primarily to early-onset forms of DCM. Overall, rare variants in these 12 genes potentially explained 17% of cases in the outpatient clinic cohort representing a broad range of adult patients with DCM and 26% of cases in the diagnostic referral cohort enriched in familial and early-onset DCM. Although the absence of a significant excess in other genes cannot preclude a limited role in disease, such genes have limited diagnostic value because novel variants will be uninterpretable and their diagnostic yield is minimal.In the largest sequenced DCM cohort yet described, we observe robust disease association with 12 genes, highlighting their importance in DCM and translating into high interpretability in diagnostic testing. The other genes analyzed here will need to be rigorously evaluated in ongoing curation efforts to determine their validity as Mendelian DCM genes but have limited value in diagnostic testing in DCM at present. This data will contribute to community gene curation efforts and will reduce erroneous and inconclusive findings in diagnostic testing."	"In this study, we assessed the importance of cytoskeleton organization in the mammalian cells used to produce therapeutic proteins. Two cytoskeletal genes, Actin alpha cardiac muscle 1 (ACTC1) and a guanosine triphosphate GTPase-activating protein (TAGAP), were found to be upregulated in highly productive therapeutic protein-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells selected by the deprivation of vitamin B5. We report here that the overexpression of the ACTC1 protein was able to improve significantly recombinant therapeutic production, as well as to decrease the levels of toxic lactate metabolic by-products. ACTC1 overexpression was accompanied by altered as well as decreased polymerized actin, which was associated with high protein production by CHO cell cultured in suspension. We suggest that the depolymerization of actin and the possible modulation of integrin signaling, as well as changes in basal metabolism, may be driving the increase of protein secretion by CHO cells."	"We recently reported a novel, heterozygous, and non-synonymous ACTC1 mutation (p.Gly247Asp or G247D) in a large, multi-generational family, causing atrial-septal defect followed by late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We also found that the G247D ACTC1 mutation negatively regulated serum response (SRF)-signaling thereby contributing to the late-onset DCM observed in human patients carrying this mutation (&quot;A cardiac α-actin (ACTC1) p. Gly247Asp mutation inhibits SRF-signaling in vitro in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes&quot; [1]). There are some ACTC1 mutations known to date, majority of which, though, have not been investigated for their functional consequence. We thus aimed at determining the functional impact of various ACTC1 gene mutations on SRF-signaling using SM22-response element driven firefly luciferase activity assays in C2C12 cells."	"Background A genetic cause can be identified in 30% of noncompaction cardiomyopathy patients (NCCM) with clinical features ranging from asymptomatic cardiomyopathy to heart failure with major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Methods and Results To investigate genotype-phenotype correlations, the genotypes and clinical features of genetic NCCM patients were collected from the literature. We compared age at diagnosis, cardiac features and risk for MACE according to mode of inheritance and molecular effects for defects in the most common sarcomere genes and NCCM subtypes. Geno- and phenotypes of 561 NCCM patients from 172 studies showed increased risk in children for congenital heart defects (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and MACE (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). In adult NCCM patients the main causes were single missense mutations in sarcomere genes. Children more frequently had an X-linked or mitochondrial inherited defect (<i>P</i>=0.001) or chromosomal anomalies (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). <i>MYH7</i> was involved in 48% of the sarcomere gene mutations. <i>MYH7</i> and <i>ACTC1</i> mutations had lower risk for MACE than <i>MYBPC3</i> and <i>TTN</i> (<i>P</i>=0.001). The NCCM/dilated cardiomyopathy cardiac phenotype was the most frequent subtype (56%; <i>P</i>=0.022) and was associated with an increased risk for MACE and high risk for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (&lt;0.001). In multivariate binary logistic regression analysis <i>MYBPC3</i>, <i>TTN,</i> arrhythmia -, non-sarcomere non-arrhythmia cardiomyopathy-and X-linked genes were genetic predictors for MACE. Conclusions Sarcomere gene mutations were the most common cause in adult patients with lower risk of MACE. Children had multi-systemic disorders with severe outcome, suggesting that the diagnostic and clinical approaches should be adjusted to age at presentation. The observed genotype-phenotype correlations endorsed that DNA diagnostics for NCCM is important for clinical management and counseling of patients."	"Treatment and prognosis of Fanconi anaemia (FA) and acquired aplastic anaemia (AA) differ. However, delayed and inappropriate treatments are administered in FA due to its similarities to AA in presentation. The objective of the current study was to elucidate differences between the molecular mechanisms underlying FA and AA as well as to identify biomarkers and pathways associated with FA via bioinformatics analyses. Proteomic data were obtained from bone marrow samples of patients with FA and AA. Gene ontology analysis was performed using a Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the ClueGO plug-in in Cytoscape. A DEP-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. A total of 114 DEPs, including 71 upregulated proteins and 43 downregulated proteins, were present in the FA samples, compared with those in the AA samples. Upregulated proteins were enriched in the nucleosome assembly, canonical glycolysis, glycolytic process, and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, whereas downregulated proteins were enriched in relation to immune response, negative regulation of apoptosis, proteolysis and CoA biosynthesis. Eight hub proteins with a high degree of connectivity were obtained as follows: alpha-enolase (ENO1), HSP90AA1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), HSP90AB1, ACTC1, ACTBL2, EEF1A1 and CFL1. Upregulation of ENO1 and CFL1 in patients with FA was confirmed through a WB experiment, and substantiated by the results of data analyses. Bioinformatics analyses are useful for identification of biomarkers and pathways associated with FA and AA. Some crucial DEPs, such as ENO1, PGK1, ACTC1, ACTBL2, EEF1A1 and CFL1, may play an important role in FA and show potential as serological markers for its early diagnosis."	"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded (GAA) trinucleotide repeat in the FXN gene. The extended repeats expansion results in reduced transcription and, thereby, decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Given the ongoing drug trials, identification of reliable and easily accessible biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic intervention is a foremost requirement. In this study, comparative proteomic profiling of PBMC proteins from FRDA patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls was done using 2D-Differential in-Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed using BioGRID and STRING pathway analysis tools. Using biological variance analysis (BVA) and LC/MS, we found eight differentially expressed proteins with fold change ≥1.5; <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05. Based on their cellular function, the identified proteins showed a strong pathological role in neuroinflammation, cardiomyopathy, compromised glucose metabolism, and iron transport, which are the major clinical manifestations of FRDA. Protein-protein network analysis of differentially expressed proteins with frataxin further supports their involvement in the pathophysiology of FRDA. Considering their crucial role in the cardiac and neurological complications, respectively, the two down-regulated proteins, actin α cardiac muscle 1 (ACTC1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit β (PDHE1), are suggested as potential prognostic markers for FRDA."	"Colon cancer is prone to distant metastases to other sites and the risk of recurrence is relatively high. Therefore, the identification of liver metastasis-related factors is important for the diagnosis or treatment of colon cancer. The aim of this study was to identify the metastasis-related factors that are differentially expressed in synchronous solitary liver metastasis compared to primary colon cancer.Tissues of primary colon cancer and associated with liver metastases of five patients were used for mass spectrometry. Identified proteins were validated by western blotting. The in silico analysis was performed using the STRING database and GeneMANIA.We identified 58 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 51 under-expressed and 7 over-expressed proteins among a total of 164 identified proteins. Major hubs of protein-protein networks were ACTC1, PRDX6, TPI1, and ALDH1A1. DEPs were located in the extracellular region and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity. The metabolic process was significantly enriched in biological processes and an involvement in the KEGG pathway.These DEPs can potentially be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of liver metastasis and they may provide a new strategy for developing anti-metastatic liver drugs in colon cancer patients."	"We recently identified a novel, heterozygous, and non-synonymous ACTC1 mutation (p.Gly247Asp or G247D) in a large, multi-generational family, causing atrial-septal defect followed by late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Molecular dynamics studies revealed possible actin polymerization defects as G247D mutation resides at the juncture of side-chain interaction, which was indeed confirmed by in vitro actin polymerization assays. Since polymerization/de-polymerization is important for the activation of Rho-GTPase-mediated serum response factor (SRF)-signaling, we studied the effect of G247D mutation using luciferase assay. Overexpression of native human ACTC1 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRVCMs) strongly activated SRF-signaling both in C2C12 cells and NRVCMs, whereas, G247D mutation abolished this activation. Mechanistically, we found reduced GTP-bound Rho-GTPase and increased nuclear localization of globular actin in NRVCMs overexpressing mutant ACTC1 possibly causing inhibition of SRF-signaling activation. In conclusion, our data suggests that human G247D ACTC1 mutation negatively regulates SRF-signaling likely contributing to the late-onset DCM observed in mutation carrier patients."	"Familial atrial septal defect (ASD) has previously been attributed primarily to mutations in cardiac transcription factors. Here, we report a large, multi-generational family (78 members) with ASD combined with a late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy and further characterize the consequences of mutant α-actin.We combined a genome-wide linkage analysis with cell biology, microscopy, and molecular biology tools to characterize a novel ACTC1 (cardiac α-actin) mutation identified in association with ASD and late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy in a large, multi-generational family.Using a genome-wide linkage analysis, the ASD disease locus was mapped to chromosome 15q14 harboring the ACTC1 gene. In 15 affected family members, a heterozygous, nonsynonymous, and fully penetrant mutation (p. Gly247Asp) was identified in exon 5 of ACTC1 that was absent in all healthy family members (n=63). In silico tools predicted deleterious consequences of this variant that was found absent in control databases. Ultrastructural analysis of myocardial tissue of one of the mutation carriers showed sarcomeric disarray, myofibrillar degeneration, and increased apoptosis, while cardiac proteomics revealed a significant increase in extracellular matrix proteins. Consistently, structural defects and increased apoptosis were also observed in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes overexpressing the mutant, but not native human ACTC1. Molecular dynamics studies and additional mechanistic analyses in cardiomyocytes confirmed actin polymerization/turnover defects, thereby affecting contractility.A combined phenotype of ASD and late-onset heart failure was caused by a heterozygous, nonsynonymous ACTC1 mutation. Mechanistically, we found a shared molecular mechanism of defective actin signaling and polymerization in both cardiac development and contractile function. Detection of ACTC1 mutations in patients with ASD may thus have further clinical implications with regard to monitoring for (late-onset) dilated cardiomyopathy."	"The cardiac muscle proteins, generating and regulating energy transduction during a heartbeat, assemble in the sarcomere into a cyclical machine repetitively translating actin relative to myosin filaments. Myosin is the motor transducing ATP free energy into actin movement against resisting force. Cardiac myosin binding protein C (mybpc3) regulates shortening velocity probably by transient N-terminus binding to actin while its C-terminus strongly binds the myosin filament. Inheritable heart disease associated mutants frequently modify these proteins involving them in disease mechanisms. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cause single residue substitutions with independent characteristics (sequence location, residue substitution, human demographic, and allele frequency) hypothesized to decide dependent phenotype and pathogenicity characteristics in a feed-forward neural network model. Trial models train and validate on a dynamic worldwide SNP database for cardiac muscle proteins then predict phenotype and pathogenicity for any single residue substitution in myosin, mybpc3, or actin. A separate Bayesian model formulates conditional probabilities for phenotype or pathogenicity given independent SNP characteristics. Neural/Bayes forecasting tests SNP pathogenicity vs (in)dependent SNP characteristics to assess individualized disease risk and in particular to elucidate gender and human subpopulation bias in disease. Evident subpopulation bias in myosin SNP pathogenicities imply myosin normally engages multiple sarcomere proteins functionally. Consistent with this observation, mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin interaction competing with myosin essential light chain N-terminus suggesting a novel strain-dependent mechanism adapting myosin force-velocity to load dynamics. The working models, and the integral myosin/mybpc3 motor concept, portends the wider considerations involved in understanding heart disease as a systemic maladaptation."	"Previously, we detected that 14-3-3 protein epsilon (YWHAE) was involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and tyrosinase-mediated pigmentation. In this study, we aimed to identify critical factors associated with YWHAE in human keratinocytes using high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches to reveal its functions in skin. We overexpressed YWHAE in human HaCaT keratinocytes and then conducted serial HTS studies, including RNA sequencing integrated with antibody arrays and the implementation of bioinformatics algorithms. Cumulatively, these approaches identified several novel genes in keratinocytes associated with the function of YWHAE including KRT9, KRT1, KRT6C, BST2, CIB2, APH1B, ACTC1, IFI27, TUBA1A, CAPN6, UTY, MX2, and MAPK15, based on RNA sequencing data, and MAPK1, MMP2, TYK2, NOS3, and CASP3, based on antibody array data. In particular, CD37 is a unique gene that was detected and validated in all the methods applied in this study. By integrating the datasets obtained from these HTS studies and utilizing the strengths of each method, we obtained new insights into the functional role of YWHAE in skin keratinocytes. The approach used here could contribute to the clinical understanding of YWHAE-associated applications in the treatment of AD disease.

"High pressure processing (HPP) is currently being developed to increase the shelf-life of sliced dry-cured ham in convenience package without detrimental effects on texture and sensorial characteristics. This study is focused on protein degradation under pressure conditions and its contribution to taste and aroma. Samples of sliced dry-cured ham undergone HPP (600 Pa, 0-35 °C) were analyzed from different approaches including proteomic and chemical analysis (amino acids and volatile compounds). Proteomic analysis revealed that high-pressure conditions caused a higher level of proteolysis, displaying that actin (ACTC1) was differentially degraded, unlike myosin. Furthermore, main Strecker metabolites-isoleucine and leucine-were more abundant at lower temperatures as opposed to 2-methyl butanal and 3-methyl butanal under HPP. Moreover, this study confirmed that HPP affected positively linear aldehydes (pentanal, hexanal, heptanal and nonanal) because of produce a decrease of them, which could improve flavor and taste of dry-cured ham."	"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratification in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), even though SCD may occur with LVEF &gt; 35%. Family history of unexplained SCD, especially in the young, raises concern about potential inheritable risk factors. It remains largely unknown how genetic tests can be integrated into clinical practice, particularly in the selection of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) candidates. We aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of genetic testing in DCM patients with a class I recommendation for ICD implantation, based on current guidelines.We included ambulatory stable adult patients with idiopathic or familial DCM with previously implanted ICD. Molecular analysis included 15 genes (<i>LMNA</i>, <i>MYH7</i>, <i>MYBPC3</i>, <i>TNNT2</i>, <i>ACTC1</i>, <i>TPM1</i>, <i>CSRP3</i>, <i>TCAP</i>, <i>SGCD</i>, <i>PLN</i>, <i>MYL2</i>, <i>MYL3</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>TAZ</i>, and <i>LDB3</i>) using next-generation sequencing.We evaluated 21 patients, 12 (57%) males and 9 (43%) with familial DCM, including 3 (14%) with a family history of premature unexplained SCD. Mean age at DCM diagnosis was 40 ± 2 years, and mean age at ICD implantation was 50 ± 12 years. LVEF was 27 ± 9%, and LV end-diastolic diameter was 65 ± 7 mm. Genetic variants were found in six (29%) patients, occurring in 5 genes: <i>TPM1</i>, <i>TNNT2</i>, <i>MYH7</i>, <i>PLN</i>, and <i>MYBPC3</i>. The majority were classified as variants of uncertain significance. Family history of SCD was present in both patients with <i>PLN</i> variants.In patients with DCM and ICD, genetic variants could be identified in a significant proportion of patients in several genes, highlighting the potential role of genetics in DCM SCD risk stratification."	"The purpose of this overview is to increase clinician awareness of the genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the benefits of early diagnosis and management to individuals with genetic HCM. The goals of this overview are the following. GOAL 1: Define HCM. GOAL 2: Identify the categories of HCM. GOAL 3: Provide the evaluation strategy for a proband with HCM to establish (when possible) the specific genetic cause. GOAL 4: Provide a basic view of genetic risk assessment of at-risk asymptomatic relatives of a proband with HCM to inform cardiac surveillance and to allow early detection and treatment of HCM to improve long-term outcome."	"Copy number variation (CNV) refers to a kind of structural variation, having functional and evolutionary effects on phenotypes. Thus far, further elucidation of the CNVs in different Chinese indigenous cattle breeds by whole genome sequencing have yet not been done. In this study, a comprehensive genomic analysis was performed on 75 cattle individuals including six Chinese indigenous cattle breeds and two non-native specialized beef cattle breeds. Based on the 11,486 CNVRs discovered, population analysis was performed, showed that all the cattle breeds clustered in to three clades, consistent with their lineages Bos taurus, Bos taurus × Bos indicus and Bos indicus. Importantly, a set of CNVRs related genes were found to be associated with the traits of interest, which include meat production or quality (CAST, ACTC1, etc.), adaption (BLA-DQB, EGLN2, etc.) and coat color (KIT, MITF, etc.). These results provide valuable full genome variation resources for Chinese bovine genome research and would be helpful for cattle breeding and selection programs in the future."	"Left ventricular non-compaction has been increasingly diagnosed in recent years. However, it is still debated whether non-compaction is a pathological condition or a physiological trait. In this meta-analysis and systematic review, we compare studies, which investigated these two different perspectives. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview on the clinical outcome as well as genetic background of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy in adult patients.We retrieved PubMed/Medline literatures in English language from 2000 to 19/09/2018 on clinical outcome and genotype of patients with non-compaction. We summarized and extensively reviewed all studies that passed selection criteria and performed a meta-analysis on key phenotypic parameters. Altogether, 35 studies with 2271 non-compaction patients were included in our meta-analysis. The mean age at diagnosis was the mid of their fifth decade. Two-thirds of patients were male. Congenital heart diseases including atrial or ventricular septum defect or Ebstein anomaly were reported in 7% of patients. Twenty-four percent presented with family history of cardiomyopathy. The mean frequency of neuromuscular diseases was 5%. Heart rhythm abnormalities were reported frequently: conduction disease in 26%, supraventricular tachycardia in 17%, and sustained or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 18% of patients. Three important outcome measures were reported including systemic thromboembolic events with a mean frequency of 9%, heart transplantation with 4%, and adequate ICD therapy with 15%. Nine studies investigated the genetics of non-compaction cardiomyopathy. The most frequently mutated gene was TTN with a pooled frequency of 11%. The average frequency of MYH7 mutations was 9%, for MYBPC3 mutations 5%, and for CASQ2 and LDB3 3% each. TPM1, MIB1, ACTC1, and LMNA mutations had an average frequency of 2% each. Mutations in PLN, HCN4, TAZ, DTNA, TNNT2, and RBM20 were reported with a frequency of 1% each. We also summarized the results of eight studies investigating the non-compaction in altogether 5327 athletes, pregnant women, patients with sickle cell disease, as well as individuals from population-based cohorts, in which the presence of left ventricular hypertrabeculation ranged from 1.3 to 37%.The summarized data indicate that non-compaction may lead to unfavorable outcome in different cardiomyopathy entities. The presence of key features in a multimodal diagnostic approach could distinguish between benign morphological trait and manifest cardiomyopathy."
"MYH7"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least common type of cardiomyopathy, being defined by diastolic dysfunction and often unimpaired systolic function. Restrictive cardiomyopathies can be classified as familial or non-familial. Patients with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy can develop signs and symptoms of this condition anytime from childhood to adulthood. The evolution of the disease is towards signs and symptoms of pulmonary and systemic congestion and, without treatment, there is a five-year mortality rate of approximately 30% in these patients. We discuss the case of a 43-year-old patient diagnosed with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy with positive genetic tests for mutations of MYH7 gene and ABCC9 gene, who was first hospitalized in 2011 for palpitations. The echocardiography performed in evolution showed a continuous alteration of right ventricle function, without important differences of left ventricular function.  She developed heart failure symptoms six years after diagnosis and she had seven hospitalizations in the past two years, currently with an increasing need of diuretics and persistent hepatic dysfunction. Cardiac transplantation or left ventricular assist device therapy should be considered in patients with severe heart failure symptoms and no longer effective treatment. However, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance excludes the patient from cardiac transplantation."	"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) represent an attractive model to investigate CM function and disease mechanisms. One characteristic marker of ventricular specificity of human CMs is expression of the ventricular, slow β-myosin heavy chain (MyHC), as opposed to the atrial, fast α-MyHC. The main aim of this study was to investigate at the single-cell level whether contraction kinetics and electrical activity of hESC-CMs are influenced by the relative expression of α-MyHC versus β-MyHC. For effective assignment of functional parameters to the expression of both MyHC isoforms at protein and mRNA levels in the very same hESC-CMs, we developed a single-cell mapping technique. Surprisingly, α- versus β-MyHC was not related to specific contractile or electrophysiological properties of the same cells. The multiparametric cell-by-cell analysis suggests that in hESC-CMs the expression of genes associated with electrical activity, contraction, calcium handling, and MyHCs is independently regulated."	"Mutations in the human <i>MYH7</i> gene, encoding a slow skeletal muscle/β-cardiac myosin heavy chain, cause different types of myopathies. The nematode model <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> has frequently been employed to study the molecular and physiological consequences of <i>MYH7</i> mutations in muscle function by introducing mutations into the <i>unc-54</i> gene, the worm <i>MYH7</i> ortholog. We report here that the <i>C. elegans</i> model is not appropriate for such studies if they involve expression of the UNC-54 protein (wild-type or fused to green fluorescent protein) above endogenous levels."	"Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by café-au-lait spots, intertriginous freckling, and multiple neurofibromas. Classically, it has been described that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may be a cardiovascular manifestation of neurofibromatosis 1, although the relationship between these two entities has not been fully established. We report a large Spanish family carrying a pathogenic truncating variant in NF1 (p.Arg2258Ter) causing neurofibromatosis 1, and a pathogenic missense variant in MYH7 (p. Arg453Cys), causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy independently. A complete penetrance was observed in both genetic diseases, reinforcing the notion of deleterious effects of both rare variants. According to our report, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in patients with NF1 should not be considered as part of the clinical spectrum in all cases. A careful and comprehensive assessment, including family evaluation and genetic testing for HCM should be considered as part of the diagnostic work-up in individuals presenting with both phenotypes."	"Few histological studies have directly examined age-related changes within the lips, although noninvasive investigations of such changes are increasing. Therefore, this study aimed to provide histological and molecular data on age-dependent alterations in the vermilion.Upper vermilion specimens from 15 female Caucasian cadavers (age range, 27-78 years) were investigated histologically or immunohistochemically.Histologically, age-dependent decreases in areas occupied by hyaluronan and collagenous fibers in the dermis of upper vermilion were demonstrated. Elastic fiber content varied widely between individuals. The area occupied by muscle fibers in the orbicularis oris muscle region within the vermilion also correlated negatively with age. Immunohistochemically, signals of four proteins were attenuated in vermilion from older individuals compared with young individuals: procollagen type I, hyaluronan synthase (HAS)1, myosin heavy chain (MYH)2 (a component of fast-twitch oxidative muscle fibers), and MYH7 (a component of slow-twitch muscle fibers). In contrast, signals of cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 1 (CEMIP) were intensified in vermilion from older individuals. No marked differences between young and older individuals were seen in procollagen type III, HAS2, HAS3, hyaluronidase (HYAL)1, HYAL2, MYH1 or MYH4.Age-dependent decreases of hyaluronan in the dermis of vermilion were prominent, possibly due to both the decrease in synthesis (HAS1) and the increase in degradation (CEMIP). Furthermore, age-dependent decreases in collagenous fibers and two types of muscle fiber in the vermilion were also identified histologically. Type I collagen, MYH2 and MYH7 appear to represent the molecules responsible for these respective decrements."	"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a relatively common arrhythmia affecting ~1-3/1,000 individuals. Mutations in PRKAG2 have been described in rare patients in association with cardiomyopathy. However, the genetic basis of WPW in individuals with a structurally normal heart remains poorly understood. Sudden death due to atrial fibrillation (AF) can also occur in these individuals. Several studies have indicated that despite ablation of an accessory pathway, the risk of AF remains high in patients compared to general population.We applied exome sequencing in 305 subjects, including 65 trios, 80 singletons, and 6 multiple affected families. We used de novo analysis, candidate gene approach, and burden testing to explore the genetic contributions to WPW.A heterozygous deleterious variant in PRKAG2 was identified in one subject, accounting for 0.6% (1/151) of the genetic basis of WPW in this study. Another individual with WPW and left ventricular hypertrophy carried a known pathogenic variant in MYH7. We found rare de novo variants in genes associated with arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy (ANK2, NEBL, PITX2, and PRDM16) in this cohort. There was an increased burden of rare deleterious variants (MAF ≤ 0.005) with CADD score ≥ 25 in genes linked to AF in cases compared to controls (P = .0023).Our findings show an increased burden of rare deleterious variants in genes linked to AF in WPW syndrome, suggesting that genetic factors that determine the development of accessory pathways may be linked to an increased susceptibility of atrial muscle to AF in a subset of patients."	"To better understand the host response to porcine reproductive and respiratory virus-2 (PRRSV2) we evaluated circulating thyroid hormone and associated gene expression in a late gestation challenge model. Pregnant gilts were inoculated at gestation day 85 and fetal samples collected at either 12 or 21 days post-infection (dpi). A subset of fetuses was selected for analysis based on viability and viral load categorized as either uninfected-viable (UNIF), high viral load viable (HV-VIA) or high viral load meconium stained (HV-MEC) and were compared with gestational age matched controls (CON). In dams, circulating levels of total T3 and T4 decreased in the acute period following infection and rebounded by 21 dpi. A similar effect was observed in fetuses, but was largely restricted to HV-VIA and HV-MEC, with minimal decrease noted in UNIF relative to CON at 21 dpi. Gene expression in fetal heart at 12 dpi showed significant decompensatory transcription of thyroid hormone transporters (SLC16A2) and deiodinases (DIO2, DIO3), which was not observed in brain. Correspondingly, genes associated with cell cycle progression (CDK1,2,4) were downregulated in only the heart of highly infected fetuses, while expression of their inhibitor (CDKN1A) was upregulated in both tissues. Finally, expression of genes associated with cardiac stress including CAMKD and AGT were upregulated in the hearts of highly infected fetuses, and a shift in expression of MYH6 to MYH7 was observed in HV-MEC fetuses specifically. Collectively, the results suggest PRRSV2 infection causes a hypothyroid state that disproportionally impacts the fetal heart over the brain."	"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by an abnormal increase in myocardial mass that affects cardiac structure and function. HCM is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease in humans (0.2%) and the most common cardiovascular disease in cats (14.7%). Feline HCM phenotype is very similar to the phenotype found in humans, but the time frame for the development of the disease is significantly shorter. Similar therapeutic agents are used in its treatment and it has the same complications, such as heart failure, thromboembolism and sudden cardiac death. In contrast to humans, in whom thousands of genetic variants have been identified, genetic studies in cats have been limited to fragment analysis of two sarcomeric genes identifying two variants in MYBPC3 and one in MYH7. Two of these variants have also been associated with human disease. The high prevalence of the reported variants in non-affected cats hinders the assumption of their pathogenicity in heterozygotes. An in-depth review of the literature about genetic studies on feline HCM in comparison with the same disease in humans is presented here. The close similarity in the phenotype and genotype between cats and humans makes the cat an excellent model for the pathophysiological study of the disease and future therapeutic agents."	"Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a hereditary cardiomyopathy that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Recently, LVNC was classified into several phenotypes including congenital heart disease (CHD). However, although LVNC and CHD are frequently observed, the role and clinical significance of genetics in these cardiomyopathies has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact on the perioperative outcomes of children with concomitant LVNC and CHD using next-generation sequencing (NGS).From May 2000 to August 2018, 53 Japanese probands with LVNC (25 males and 28 females) were enrolled and we screened 182 cardiomyopathy-associated genes in these patients using NGS.The age at diagnosis of the enrolled patients ranged from 0 to 14 years (median: 0.3 months). A total of 23 patients (43.4%) were diagnosed with heart failure, 14 with heart murmur (26.4%), and 6 with cyanosis (11.3%). During the observation period, 31 patients (58.5%) experienced heart failure and 13 (24.5%) developed arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and atrioventricular block. Moreover, 29 patients (54.7%) had ventricular septal defects (VSDs), 17 (32.1%) had atrial septal defects, 10 had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and 7 (13.2%) had Ebstein's anomaly and double outlet right ventricle. Among the included patients, 30 underwent surgery, 19 underwent biventricular repair, and 2 underwent pulmonary artery banding, bilateral pulmonary artery banding, and PDA ligation. Overall, 30 genetic variants were identified in 28 patients with LVNC and CHD. Eight variants were detected in <i>MYH7</i> and two in <i>TPM1.</i> Echocardiography showed lower ejection fractions and more thickened trabeculations in the left ventricle in patients with LVNC and CHD than in age-matched patients with VSDs. During follow-up, 4 patients died and the condition of 8 worsened postoperatively. The multivariable proportional hazards model showed that heart failure, LV ejection fraction of &lt; 24%, LV end-diastolic diameter z-score of &gt; 8.56, and noncompacted-to-compacted ratio of the left ventricular apex of &gt; 8.33 at the last visit were risk factors for survival.LVNC and CHD are frequently associated with genetic abnormalities. Knowledge of the association between CHD and LVNC is important for the awareness of clinical implications during the preoperative and postoperative periods to identify the populations who are at an increased risk of additional morbidity."	"Fetal dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an uncommon prenatal diagnosis associated with significant morbidity and mortality.This report describes a patient with a diagnosis of fetal DCM at 31<sup>0</sup> weeks gestation, several weeks after a maternal flu-like illness. Spontaneous improvement was noted on serial echocardiograms. Maternal Coxsackievirus B titers were significantly elevated at 1:80, although post-natal cord blood test results were negative. Genetic panel testing for DCM demonstrated two heterozygous variants of uncertain significance in the MYH7 and DSG2 genes. Although an early post-natal echocardiogram demonstrated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular dysfunction was noted with subsequent cardiac decompensation requiring temporary inotropic support. An echocardiogram at the age of 2 years confirmed normal biventricular function.The finding of fetal DCM should trigger a broad evaluation. In the setting of limited fetal cardiac reserve, the significant hemodynamic changes that occur post-natally may trigger additional decompensation. Clinicians should be aware of the prognostic value of right ventricular function, as measured by fractional area change, in addition to the limitations of serologic and genetic testing."	"The hypothesis of the Dilated Cardiomyopathy Precision Medicine Study is that most dilated cardiomyopathy has a genetic basis. The study returns results to probands and, when indicated, to relatives. While both the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology and ClinGen's <i>MYH7</i>-cardiomyopathy specifications provide relevant guidance for variant interpretation, further gene- and disease-specific considerations were required for dilated cardiomyopathy. To this end, we tailored the ClinGen <i>MYH7</i>-cardiomyopathy variant interpretation framework; the specifications implemented for the study are presented here.Modifications were created and approved by an external Variant Adjudication Oversight Committee. After a pilot using 81 probands, further adjustments were made, resulting in 27 criteria (9 modifications of the ClinGen <i>MYH7</i> framework and reintroduction of 2 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association of Molecular Pathology criteria that were deemed not applicable by the ClinGen <i>MYH7</i> working group).These criteria were applied to 2059 variants in a test set of 97 probands. Variants were classified as benign (n=1702), likely benign (n=33), uncertain significance (n=71), likely pathogenic (likely pathogenic; n=12), and pathogenic (P; n=3). Only 2/15 likely pathogenic/P variants were identified in Non-Hispanic African ancestry probands.We tailored the ClinGen <i>MYH7</i> criteria for our study. Our preliminary data show that 15/97 (15.5%) probands have likely pathogenic/P variants, most of which were identified in probands of Non-Hispanic European ancestry. We anticipate continued evolution of our approach, one that will be informed by new insights on variant interpretation and a greater understanding of the genetic architecture of dilated cardiomyopathy.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03037632."	"Chagas cardiomyopathy is caused by <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> (<i>Tc</i>). We identified two candidate antigens (TcG2 and TcG4) that elicit antibodies and T cell responses in naturally infected diverse hosts. In this study, we cloned <i>TcG2</i> and <i>TcG4</i> in a nanovector and evaluated whether nano-immunotherapy (referred as nano2/4) offers resistance to chronic Chagas disease. For this, C57BL/6 mice were infected with <i>Tc</i> and given nano2/4 at 21 and 42 days post-infection (pi). Non-infected, infected, and infected mice treated with pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid encoding <i>TcG2/TcG4</i> (referred as p2/4) were used as controls. All mice responded to <i>Tc</i> infection with expansion and functional activation of splenic lymphocytes. Flow cytometry showed that frequency of splenic, poly-functional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing interferon-γ, perforin, and granzyme B were increased by immunotherapy (<i>Tc.</i>nano2/4 &gt; <i>Tc.</i>p2/4) and associated with 88%-99.7% decline in cardiac and skeletal (SK) tissue levels of parasite burden (<i>Tc.</i>nano2/4 &gt; <i>Tc.</i>p2/4) in Chagas mice. Subsequently, <i>Tc.</i>nano2/4 mice exhibited a significant decline in peripheral and tissues levels of oxidative stress (e.g., 4-hydroxynonenal, protein carbonyls) and inflammatory infiltrate that otherwise were pronounced in Chagas mice. Further, nano2/4 therapy was effective in controlling the tissue infiltration of pro-fibrotic macrophages and established a balanced environment controlling the expression of collagens, metalloproteinases, and other markers of cardiomyopathy and improving the expression of <i>Myh7</i> (encodes β myosin heavy chain) and <i>Gsk3b</i> (encodes glycogen synthase kinase 3) required for maintaining cardiac contractility in Chagas heart. We conclude that nano2/4 enhances the systemic T cell immunity that improves the host's ability to control chronic parasite persistence and Chagas cardiomyopathy."	"Musk compounds are often used as to treat heart-related diseases and are widely used in Asia. Muscone is one of the most important physiologically active compounds of natural musk. Muscone is a chiral compound and can be further classified into S-muscone and R-muscone and both are present in synthetic musk. While these two chiral isomers have significant differences in odor properties, their difference in toxicity is still unknown. This study used zebrafish as an animal model to compare cardiac toxicities of S-muscone and R-muscone. Results showed that both compounds were acutely toxic to zebrafish embryos causing mortality, decreased hatching rate, pericardial edema, and decreased heart beat rate. These toxicities were modulated through increased Myh6 and Myh7 mRNA expression, and decreased thyroid genes (Trh, Thrβ, and Dio3) expression. R-muscone caused higher toxicity than S-muscone at the same concentration. For safety, the chiral isomer composition of synthetic muscone should be carefully regulated in the future."	"Hundreds of dominant-negative myosin mutations have been identified that lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the biomechanical link between mutation and disease is heterogeneous across this patient population. To increase the therapeutic feasibility of treating this diverse genetic population, we investigated the ability of locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to selectively knock down mutant myosin transcripts by targeting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were found to be common in the myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) gene. We identified three SNPs in MYH7 and designed ASO libraries to selectively target either the reference or alternate MYH7 sequence. We identified ASOs that selectively knocked down either the reference or alternate allele at all three SNP regions. We also show allele-selective knockdown in a mouse model that was humanized on one allele. These results suggest that SNP-targeting ASOs are a promising therapeutic modality for treating cardiac pathology."	"Cardiac and renal dysfunction are often co-morbid pathologies leading to worsening prognosis resulting in difficulty in therapy of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The aim of the current study was to determine the changes in expression of human ortholog genes of hypertension, vascular and cardiac remodeling and hypertensive nephropathy phenotypes under normal, disease and upon treatment with gasotransmitter including H<sub>2</sub>S (hydrogen sulphide), NO (nitric oxide) and combined (H<sub>2</sub>S + NO).A total of 72 Wistar Kyoto rats (with equivalent male and female animals) were recruited in the present study where LVH rat models were treated with H<sub>2</sub>S and NO individually as well as with both combined. Cardiac and renal physical indices were recorded and relative gene expression were quantified.Both cardiac and renal physical indices were significantly modified with individual as well as combined H<sub>2</sub>S + NO treatment in control and LVH rats. Expression analysis revealed, hypertension, vascular remodeling genes ACE, TNFα and IGF1, mRNAs to be significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in the myocardia and renal tissues of LVH rats, while individual and combined H<sub>2</sub>S + NO treatment resulted in lowering the gene expression to normal/near to normal levels. The cardiac remodeling genes MYH7, TGFβ, SMAD4 and BRG1 expression were significantly up-regulated (P ≤ 0.05) in the myocardia of LVH where the combined H<sub>2</sub>S + NO treatment resulted in normal/near to normal expression more effectively as compared to individual treatments. In addition individual as well as combined H<sub>2</sub>S and NO treatment significantly decreased PKD1 expression in renal tissue, which was up-regulated in LVH rats (P ≤ 0.05).The reduction in hemodynamic parameters and cardiac indices as well as alteration in gene expression on treatment of LVH rat model indicates important therapeutic potential of combined treatment with H<sub>2</sub>S + NO gasotransmitters in hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy when present as co-morbidity with renal complications."	"Meat quality prediction is a priority for the beef industry. Label free shotgun proteomics was performed on Longissimus muscle and plasma from 20 crossbred Charolais x Aubrac beef heifers, classified as subgroups of 5 extreme tender and 5 extreme tough meat according to sensory evaluation, Warner Bratzler shear force, and a synthetic tenderness index. This technique identified 268 proteins in muscle and 136 in plasma. Among them, 71 muscle proteins and 21 plasma proteins discriminated tender and tough groups. These proteins were analyzed to select the most correlated and explicative ones which were used in a linear regression on the 20 heifers. The results validated in heifers 33 muscle proteins previously identified as related with tenderness, and revealed 38 new candidates. Twelve are localized in shear force or tenderness score QTL. Among them ACTN2, ADSSL1, GOT1, HPX, OGDH, OGN, TNNC1 and VCL are proposed as robust candidates with 3 other proteins known to be related with tenderness (MYBPH, CAPZB, MYH1). Examination of the plasma proteome showed 8 putative biomarkers (MYH7, CFH, ENO3, PLA2G2D5, FHL1, GAPDH, MASP2 and SERPINF2). Three of them (MYH7, ENO3 and FHL1) were identified as discriminative of tenderness both in Longissimus muscle and in plasma. SIGNIFICANCE: The label free proteomic approach used in this study allowed to complete the atlas of biomarkers for tenderness of the Longissimus muscle. This innovative proteomic approach applied on plasma samples allowed to identify circulating candidate biomarkers for beef tenderness. This low-invasive approach constitutes an interesting alternative to evaluate early the &quot;beef meat potential&quot; of living animals in farm or of the carcass in slaughterhouses."	"Studies of the gene and miRNA expression profiles associated with the postnatal late growth, development, and aging of skeletal muscle are lacking in sika deer. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the growth and development of sika deer skeletal muscle, we used de novo RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) analyses to determine the differentially expressed (DE) unigenes and miRNAs from skeletal muscle tissues at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years in sika deer. A total of 51,716 unigenes, 171 known miRNAs, and 60 novel miRNAs were identified based on four mRNA and small RNA libraries. A total of 2,044 unigenes and 11 miRNAs were differentially expressed between adolescence and juvenile sika deer, 1,946 unigenes and 4 miRNAs were differentially expressed between adult and adolescent sika deer, and 2,209 unigenes and 1 miRNAs were differentially expressed between aged and adult sika deer. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that DE unigenes and miRNA were mainly related to energy and substance metabolism, processes that are closely associate with the growth, development, and aging of skeletal muscle. We also constructed mRNA-mRNA and miRNA-mRNA interaction networks related to the growth, development, and aging of skeletal muscle. The results show that mRNA (Myh1, Myh2, Myh7, ACTN3, etc.) and miRNAs (miR-133a, miR-133c, miR-192, miR-151-3p, etc.) may play important roles in muscle growth and development, and mRNA (WWP1, DEK, UCP3, FUS, etc.) and miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR-378b, miR-199a-5p, miR-7, etc.) may have key roles in muscle aging. In this study, we determined the dynamic miRNA and unigenes transcriptome in muscle tissue for the first time in sika deer. The age-dependent miRNAs and unigenes identified will offer insights into the molecular mechanism underlying muscle development, growth, and maintenance and will also provide valuable information for sika deer genetic breeding."	"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cardiovascular disease with genetic transmission, characterized by the hypertrophy of any segment of the left ventricle (LV), not totally explained by improper loading conditions, with LV systolic function preserved, increased, or reduced. The histopathological mechanism involved in HCM refers to the primary injury of the myocardium, as follows: disorganized array of myocytes, extracellular matrix modification, microvascular dysfunction, with subsequent appearance of myocardial fibrosis. Multiple sarcomere proteins mutations are responsible for HCM, but two of them are involved in 70% of the cases of HCM: β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3). The development of new genetic techniques involving genome editing is promising to discover a gene therapy for patients with HCM. Clinical presentation may differ from asymptomatic to sudden cardiac death (SCD), the last one targeting younger adults. In this case, the diagnosis and evaluation of SCD risk factors is extremely important. The common method of diagnosis is transthoracic echocardiography, but cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging represents &quot;gold standard&quot; in the evaluation of HCM patients. Treatment includes pharmacological therapy, surgery, alcohol ablation, and not least SCD prevention."	"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. military and competitive athletes. In this study, we simulate how genetic screening may be implemented in the military to prevent an SCD endpoint resulting from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We created a logistic regression model to predict variant pathogenicity in the most common HCM associated genes MYH7 and MYBPC3. Model predictions were used in conjunction with the gnomAD database to identify frequencies of pathogenic variants. Extrapolating these variants to a military population, lives saved and cost benefit analyses were conducted for screening for HCM related to pathogenic variants in MYH7 and MYBPC3. Genetic screening for HCM followed by echocardiography in individuals with pathogenic variants is predicted to save an average of 2.9 lives per accession cohort, based on historical cohort sizes, and result in a break-even cost of ~$7 per test. The false positives, defined as disqualified individuals for military service who do not have HCM, are predicted to be 0 individuals per accession cohort. This study suggests that the main barriers for the implementation of genetic screening for the U.S. military are the low detection rate and variant interpretation."	"The vast majority of cardiomyopathies have an autosomal dominant inheritance; hence, genetic testing is typically offered to patients with a positive family history. A de novo mutation is a new germline mutation not inherited from either parent. The purpose of our study was to search for de novo mutations in patients with cardiomyopathy and no evidence of the disease in the family. Using next-generation sequencing, we analyzed cardiomyopathy genes in 12 probands. In 8 (66.7%), we found de novo variants in known cardiomyopathy genes (<i>TTN</i>, <i>DSP</i>, <i>SCN5A</i>, <i>TNNC1</i>, <i>TPM1</i>, <i>CRYAB</i>, <i>MYH7</i>). In the remaining probands, the analysis was extended to whole exome sequencing in a trio (proband and parents). We found de novo variants in genes that, so far, were not associated with any disease (<i>TRIB3</i>, <i>SLC2A6</i>), a possible disease-causing biallelic genotype (<i>APOBEC</i> gene family), and a de novo mosaic variant without strong evidence of pathogenicity (<i>UNC45A</i>). The high prevalence of de novo mutations emphasizes that genetic screening is also indicated in cases of sporadic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, we have identified novel cardiomyopathy candidate genes that are likely to affect immunological function and/or reaction to stress that could be especially relevant in patients with disease onset associated with infection/infestation."
"MYL3"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"Traditional serum biomarkers used to assess skeletal muscle damage, such as activity of creatine kinase (CK), lack tissue specificity and sensitivity, hindering early detection of drug-induced myopathies. Recently, a novel four-factor skeletal muscle injury panel (MIP) of biomarkers consisting of skeletal troponin I (sTnI), CK mass (CKm), fatty acid binding protein 3 (Fabp3), and myosin light chain 3 (Myl3), has been shown to have increased tissue specificity and sensitivity in rodent models of skeletal muscle injury. Here, we evaluated if a previously established model of tissue-engineered functional human skeletal muscle (&quot;myobundle&quot;) can allow detection of the MIP biomarkers after injury or drug-induced myotoxicity in vitro. We found that concentrations of three MIP biomarkers (sTnI, CKm and Fabp3) in myobundle culture media significantly increased in response to injury by a known snake venom (notexin). Cerivastatin, a known myotoxic statin, but not pravastatin, induced significant loss of myobundle contractile function, myotube atrophy, and increased release of both traditional and novel biomarkers. In contrast, dexamethasone induced significant loss of myobundle contractile function and myotube atrophy, but decreased the release of both traditional and novel biomarkers. Dexamethasone also increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -3 in the culture media which correlated with increased remodeling of myobundle extracellular matrix. In conclusion, this proof of concept study demonstrates that tissue-engineered human myobundles can provide an in vitro platform to probe patient-specific drug-induced myotoxicity and identify of novel injury biomarkers to guide preclinical and clinical drug development studies."	"BACKGROUND Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a progressive autoimmune disorder caused by the production of antibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of grilled nux vomica (GNV) in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Rat 97-116 peptides were used to mediate disease in the EAMG model in SPF female Lewis rats. The treatment groups received grilled nux vomica (75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 225 mg/kg). The autoantibody and inflammatory cytokines levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RNA profiling was performed on high-dose and model group rats. Profiling results and TLR-4/NF-kappaB signaling were validated by q-PCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS The results showed that GNV could attenuate the symptoms of EAMG rats. There was a decreased level of AChR-ab, IFN-γ, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17 levels, and an increased level of TGF-ß1. In total, 235 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), consisting of 175 upregulated DEGs and 60 downregulated DEGs, were identified. Functional annotation demonstrated that DEGs were largely associated with leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, muscle contraction, and cardiac muscle contraction pathway. Rac2, Itgb2, Lcp2, Myl3, and Tnni1 were considered as hub genes with a higher degree value in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The q-PCR and Western blot results of hub genes were consistent with RNA profiles. GNV treatment also significantly reduced the TLR-4 and NF-kappaB p65 protein expression in EAMG rats. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that grilled nux vomica ameliorates EAMG by depressing the TLR-4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, and hub genes may serve as potential targets for MG treatment."	"The aim of this study was to find out neuron (-like) cells in peripheral organs by cell markers in rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized. Their organs including brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, stomach, duodenum, and ileum were harvested. The mRNA and protein in these organs were extracted. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was carried out, and NeuN, a &quot;specific&quot; marker for neuronal soma, was assayed with Western blotting. The sections of the aforementioned organs were obtained after a routine fixation (4% methanal)-dehydration (ethanol)-embedding (paraffin) process. NeuN in the sections and seven non-neuronal cell lines was analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). Neuronal markers, such as Eno2, NeuN (Rbfox3), choline acetyltransferase (Chat), as well as tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), and neuronal-glial markers, e.g., glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), S100b, 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (Cnp), and other related markers, were positively expressed in all the organs at mRNA level. NeuN was further analyzed by Western blotting. The IF and IHC assays showed that NeuN-positive cells were distributed in all the peripheral tissues (mainly peri-nuclear NeuN-positive cells) though with different patterns from that in brain (nuclear NeuN-positive cells), and a NeuN-negative tissue could not be found. Especially, NeuN and Myl3 co-expressed in the cytoplasm of myocardial cells, suggesting that NeuN could possess other functions than neuronal differentiation. Also, the protein was positively expressed in seven non-neuronal cell lines. Our findings suggested that NeuN-positive cells exist widely, and without identification of its distribution pattern, the specificity of NeuN for neurons could be limited."	"Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Although great efforts have been made to understand the pathogenesis and development of ES, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify new key genes as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, targeted therapy or prognosis of ES. mRNA expression profile chip data sets GSE17674, GSE17679 and GSE45544 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the R software limma package, and functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the enrichplot package and GSEA software. The NetworkAnalyst online tool, as well as Cytoscape and its plug-ins cytoHubba and NetworkAnalyzer, were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and conduct module analysis to screen key (hub) genes. LABSO COX regression and overall survival (OS) analysis of the Hub genes were performed. A total of 211 DEGs were obtained by integrating and analyzing the three data sets. The functions and pathways of the DEGs were mainly associated with the regulation of small-molecule metabolic processes, cofactor-binding, amino acid, proteasome and ribosome biosynthesis in eukaryotes, as well as the Rac1, cell cycle and P53 signaling pathways. A total of one important module and 20 hub genes were screened from the PPI network using the Maximum Correlation Criteria algorithm of cytoHubba. LASSO COX regression results revealed that titin (<i>TTN</i>), fast skeletal muscle troponin T, skeletal muscle actin α-actin, nebulin, troponin C type 2 (fast), myosin light-chain 3 (<i>MYL3</i>), slow skeletal muscle troponin T (<i>TNNT1</i>), myosin-binding protein C1 slow-type, tropomyosin 3 and myosin heavy-chain 7 were associated with prognosis in patients with ES. The Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that high mRNA expression levels of <i>TNNT1</i> (P&lt;0.001), <i>TTN</i> (P=0.049), titin-cap (P=0.04), tropomodulin 1 (P=0.011), troponin I2 fast skeletal type (P=0.021) and <i>MYL3</i> (P=0.017) were associated with poor OS in patients with ES. In conclusion, the DEGs identified in the present study may be key genes in the pathogenesis of ES, three of which, namely <i>TNNT1, TTN</i> and <i>MYL3</i>, may be potential prognostic biomarkers for ES."	"<b>Background:</b> A proportion of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM) is caused by mutations in the <i>TTR</i> gene. Our aim was to study the prevalence of potentially amyloidogenic <i>TTR</i> variants in a whole-exome sequencing (WES) study of a large HCM cohort. <b>Methods and results:</b> 770 consecutive HCM probands underwent WES and clinical characterisation. Patients with rare or known pathogenic variants in <i>TTR</i> underwent 99mTechnetium labelled 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) scintigraphy and were retrospectively re-assessed for clinical features of amyloidosis. Two patients had rare <i>TTR</i> variants of unknown significance and four had the known pathogenic V122I (<i>p.V142I</i>) variant (one homozygous and also heterozygous for a likely pathogenic <i>MYL3</i> variant and another double heterozygous for a likely pathogenic <i>MYBPC3</i> variant). Four out of 6 patients with <i>TTR</i> variants underwent DPD scintigraphy; the only positive study was in the patient with the homozygous V122I (<i>p.V142I</i>) variant. <b>Conclusions:</b> Pathogenic <i>TTR</i> variants are rare in carefully assessed HCM patients and may occur in double heterozygosity with pathogenic sarcomere variants. The lack of evidence for an amyloidosis phenotype in all but one <i>TTR</i> variant carrier illustrates the importance of complete clinical evaluation of HCM patients that harbour pathogenic <i>TTR</i> variants."	"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary mulberry leaves on the transcriptome profiles of finishing pigs. RNA-Seq was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the longissimus dorsi of 56 pigs fed either a traditional diet or diets supplemented with 3%, 6% or 9% mulberry leaf powder, and both gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the subnet module analysis were used to identify genes with beneficial potential, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the expression patterns revealed by RNA-Seq.Pigs fed with the 6% mulberry diet exhibited greater average daily gain, lower water loss and lower shear force than the control group and yielded 531 DEGs, including 271 and 260 upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. Function analysis revealed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in functions related to muscle growth and development. Furthermore, several genes (i.e. ACOT4, ECHS1, HACD1, NPR1, ADCY2, MGLL and IRS1) were enriched in a KEGG pathway that was associated with fatty acid metabolism, and in the PPI subnet module, four of eight node genes, namely TNNC1, MYL3, TCAP and TNNT1, were associated with muscle formation and development. The upregulation of these genes, including TNNC1, TNNT1 and MYL3, was confirmed by qRT-PCR.Dietary mulberry leaves (6%) may improve the muscle quality of pigs by modulating the expression of several key genes, such as TNNC1, MYL3 and TNNT1."	"Gene expression has become an interesting research area in forensic pathology to investigate the process of death at the molecular level. The aims of this study were to analyze changes in gene expression patterns in relation to the cause of death, and to propose new molecular markers of myocardial ischemia of potential use for the postmortem diagnosis of early ischemic heart damage in cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD). We determined mRNA levels of five proteins related with ischemic myocardial damage and repair - TNNI3, MYL3, TGFB1, MMP9 and VEGFA - in specific sites of the myocardium, blood and pericardial fluid in samples from 30 cadavers with different causes of death (SCD, multiple trauma, mechanical asphyxia, and other natural deaths). TNNI3 expression in blood, and MMP9 expression in pericardial fluid, were significantly higher when the cause of death was mechanical asphyxia, probably because of the more sensitive response of these proteins to acute systemic hypoxia/ischemia. Specifically, among SCD cases, increased MYL3, VEGFA and MMP9 values in the anterior wall of the right ventricle were found when the confirmed cause of death was acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Higher TGFB1 expression was found in the interventricular septum when AMI was not the cause of death, most likely as a reflection of the short duration of ischemia. Molecular biology techniques can provide complementary tools for the forensic diagnosis of early ischemic myocardial damage and AMI, and may make it possible to determine the duration and severity of myocardial ischemia."	"The positive perception of deer meat among consumers is growing. Consequently, further efforts are needed to control its meat quality. Specifically, the aim of this study was to search protein biomarkers in connection with tenderness and intramuscular fat (IMF) content of Iberian wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) meat. Twelve venison samples classified as tender, intermediate and tough meat, as well as with different IMF were studied, using quantitative proteomic by SWATH-MS combined with bioinformatic analyses. The study of muscle proteome showed significant differences among these three groups of meat samples, since five differentially abundant proteins (IVD, LAMB1, MYL3, SDHC and SDHA) and six (FABP4, IVD, LAMB1, MYL3, CRYZ and SERPINB6) were strongly correlated with tenderness and IMF, respectively. The proteomic approach provides protein biomarkers linked to venison meat quality and marked changes in proteins related to oxidoreductase complex in skeletal muscle. SIGNIFICANCE: Meat tenderness and IMF are major concerns in game meat. The proteomic approach demonstrated a strong correlation between proteins and these quality traits, despite the complexity of samples (wild animals hunted at different ages). Our results suggest that several proteins can be biomarkers and provide a molecular insight."	"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratification in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), even though SCD may occur with LVEF &gt; 35%. Family history of unexplained SCD, especially in the young, raises concern about potential inheritable risk factors. It remains largely unknown how genetic tests can be integrated into clinical practice, particularly in the selection of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) candidates. We aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of genetic testing in DCM patients with a class I recommendation for ICD implantation, based on current guidelines.We included ambulatory stable adult patients with idiopathic or familial DCM with previously implanted ICD. Molecular analysis included 15 genes (<i>LMNA</i>, <i>MYH7</i>, <i>MYBPC3</i>, <i>TNNT2</i>, <i>ACTC1</i>, <i>TPM1</i>, <i>CSRP3</i>, <i>TCAP</i>, <i>SGCD</i>, <i>PLN</i>, <i>MYL2</i>, <i>MYL3</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>TAZ</i>, and <i>LDB3</i>) using next-generation sequencing.We evaluated 21 patients, 12 (57%) males and 9 (43%) with familial DCM, including 3 (14%) with a family history of premature unexplained SCD. Mean age at DCM diagnosis was 40 ± 2 years, and mean age at ICD implantation was 50 ± 12 years. LVEF was 27 ± 9%, and LV end-diastolic diameter was 65 ± 7 mm. Genetic variants were found in six (29%) patients, occurring in 5 genes: <i>TPM1</i>, <i>TNNT2</i>, <i>MYH7</i>, <i>PLN</i>, and <i>MYBPC3</i>. The majority were classified as variants of uncertain significance. Family history of SCD was present in both patients with <i>PLN</i> variants.In patients with DCM and ICD, genetic variants could be identified in a significant proportion of patients in several genes, highlighting the potential role of genetics in DCM SCD risk stratification."	"The purpose of this overview is to increase clinician awareness of the genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the benefits of early diagnosis and management to individuals with genetic HCM. The goals of this overview are the following. GOAL 1: Define HCM. GOAL 2: Identify the categories of HCM. GOAL 3: Provide the evaluation strategy for a proband with HCM to establish (when possible) the specific genetic cause. GOAL 4: Provide a basic view of genetic risk assessment of at-risk asymptomatic relatives of a proband with HCM to inform cardiac surveillance and to allow early detection and treatment of HCM to improve long-term outcome."	"Lung injury due to zinc chloride smoke inhalation is very common in military personnel and leads to a high incidence of pulmonary complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to uncover the underlying mechanisms of lung injury due to zinc chloride smoke inhalation using a rat model.Histopathology analysis of rat lungs after zinc chloride smoke inhalation was performed by using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Mallory staining. A lung injury rat model of zinc chloride smoke inhalation (smoke inhalation for 1, 2, 7 and 14 days) was developed. First, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantization (iTRAQ) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify important differentially expressed proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were used to study the biological functions of differentially expressed proteins. Then, analysis of lung injury repair-related differentially expressed proteins in the early (day 1 and day 2) and middle-late stages (day 7 and day 14) of lung injury after smoke inhalation was performed, followed by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of these differentially expressed proteins. Finally, the injury repair-related proteins PARK7 and FABP5 were validated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.Morphological changes were observed in the lung tissues after zinc chloride smoke inhalation. A total of 27 common differentially expressed proteins were obtained on days 1, 2, 7 and 14 after smoke inhalation. WGCNA showed that the turquoise module (which involved 909 proteins) was most associated with smoke inhalation time. Myl3, Ckm, Adrm1 and Igfbp7 were identified in the early stages of lung injury repair. Gapdh, Acly, Tnni2, Acta1, Actn3, Pygm, Eno3 and Tpi1 (hub proteins in the PPI network) were identified in the middle-late stages of lung injury repair. Eno3 and Tpi1 were both involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis signalling pathway. The expression of PARK7 and FABP5 was validated and was consistent with the proteomics analysis.The identified hub proteins and their related signalling pathways may play crucial roles in lung injury repair due to zinc chloride smoke inhalation."	"Genetic testing for families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) provides a significant opportunity to improve care. Recent trends to increase gene panel sizes often mean variants in genes with questionable association are reported to patients. Classification of HCM genes and variants is critical, as misclassification can lead to genetic misdiagnosis. We show the validity of previously reported HCM genes using an established method for evaluating gene-disease associations.A systematic approach was used to assess the validity of reported gene-disease associations, including associations with isolated HCM and syndromes including left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes were categorized as having definitive, strong, moderate, limited, or no evidence of disease causation. We also reviewed current variant classifications for HCM in ClinVar, a publicly available variant resource.Fifty-seven genes were selected for curation based on their frequent inclusion in HCM testing and prior association reports. Of 33 HCM genes, only 8 (24%) were categorized as definitive ( MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, ACTC1, MYL2, and MYL3); 3 had moderate evidence ( CSRP3, TNNC1, and JPH2; 33%); and 22 (66%) had limited (n=16) or no evidence (n=6). There were 12 of 24 syndromic genes definitively associated with isolated left ventricular hypertrophy. Of 4191 HCM variants in ClinVar, 31% were in genes with limited or no evidence of disease association.The majority of genes previously reported as causative of HCM and commonly included in diagnostic tests have limited or no evidence of disease association. Systematically curated HCM genes are essential to guide appropriate reporting of variants and ensure the best possible outcomes for HCM families."	"Myosin is a hexameric contractile protein composed of 2 heavy chains associated with 4 light chains of 2 distinct classes - 2 regulatory light chains (MYL2) and 2 essential light chains (MYL3). The myosin light chains stabilize the long alpha helical neck of the myosin head and regulate the myosin ATPase activities.Mutations in MYL2 and MYL3 are reported to be associated with cardiomyopathies. However, there is no study available on these genes in Indian cardiomyopathies, and therefore we planned to study them.For the first time we sequenced MYL2 and MYL3 genes in a total of 248 clinically well-characterized cardiomyopathies consisting of 101 hypertrophic and 147 dilated cases along with 207 healthy controls from south India.Our study revealed a total of 10 variations - 7 in MYL2 and 3 in MYL3, of which 3 are novel variations observed exclusively in cases. However, the 15 causative missense mutations previously reported are totally absent in our study, which showed that the sequences of MYL2 and MYL3 are highly conserved in Indian cases/controls.MYL2 and MYL3 mutations are rare and the least cause of cardiomyopathies in Indians."	"Seasonal temperature changes markedly effect the swimming performance of some cyprinid fish acutely tested at different temperatures, involving a restructuring of skeletal muscle phenotype including changes in contractile properties and myosin heavy chain expression. We analyzed the transcriptome of fast myotomal muscle from goldfish (<i>Carassius auratus</i> L.) acclimated to either 8 or 25°C for 4 weeks (12 h light: 12 h dark) and identified 10 myosin heavy chains (<i>myh</i>) and 13 myosin light chain (<i>myl</i>) transcripts. Goldfish orthologs were classified based on zebrafish nomenclature as <i>myhz1.1α</i>, <i>myhz1.1β</i>, <i>myhz1.1γ</i>, <i>myha</i>, <i>myhb</i>, <i>embryo_myh1, myh9b, smyh2</i>, <i>symh3</i>, and <i>myh11</i> (myosin heavy chains) <i>and myl1a</i>, <i>myl1b</i>, <i>myl2</i>, <i>myl9a</i>, <i>myl9b</i>, <i>myl3</i>, <i>myl13</i>, <i>myl6, myl12.1a, myl12.1b, myl12.2a, myl12.2b</i>, and <i>myl10</i> (myosin light chains). The most abundantly expressed transcripts <i>myhz1.1α</i>, <i>myhz1.1β</i>, <i>myhz1.1γ</i>, <i>myha</i>, <i>myl1a</i>, <i>myl1b</i>, <i>myl2</i>, and <i>myl3</i>) were further investigated in fast skeletal muscle of goldfish acclimated to either 4, 8, 15, or 30°C for 12 weeks (12 h light:12 h dark). Total copy number for the myosin heavy chains showed a distinct optimum at 15°C (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Together m<i>yhz1.1α</i> and <i>myhz1.1β</i> comprised 90 to 97% of myhc transcripts below 15°C, but only 62% at 30°C. Whereas <i>myhz1.1α</i> and <i>myhz1.1β</i> were equally abundant at 4 and 8°C, <i>myhz1.1β</i> transcripts were 17 and 12 times higher than <i>myhz1.1α</i> at 15 and 30°C, respectively, (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). M<i>yhz1.1γ</i> expression was at least nine-fold higher at 30°C than at cooler temperatures (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). In contrast, the expression of <i>myha</i> and myosin light chains showed no consistent pattern with acclimation temperature. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the previously reported ability of goldfish and common carp to alter contractile properties and myofibrillar ATPase activity with temperature acclimation was related to the duplication of a single <i>myhz1.1</i> fast muscle myosin heavy chain found in basal cyprinids such as the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)."	"The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between oxidative damage to proteins (represented by protein carbonylation) and beef tenderness. Three experimental groups were selected by shear force (SF): tender (38.2 ± 2.9 N), intermediate (51.9 ± 6.8 N), and tough meat (74.5 ± 7.8 N). Two-dimensional electrophoresis with hydrazide fluorophore derivatization was used. The structural proteins actin (ACTA1), myosin (MYL1 and MYL3), desmin (DES) and troponin T (TNNT1 and TNNT3), antioxidant proteins (PRDX1, PRDX2 and PARK7) and heat shock proteins (HSPB1, CRYAB and HSPB6) showed an increase in the oxidative damage in tender meat when compared to the intermediate and tough meat (P &lt; .05). Decrease in oxidative damage of the metabolic enzymes (TPI1, GAPDH and ENO3) were observed in tender meat group (P &lt; .05). The present results suggest that oxidation act on the proteins of different metabolic pathways and consequently affect meat tenderness in Angus crossbred cattle."	"Branched-chain amino acids promote both protein and mRNA synthesis through mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. A previous report demonstrated that chronic branched-chain amino acid supplementation increased mitochondrial biogenesis in the skeletal muscle of middle-aged mice through activation of mTOR signaling. In this study, we hypothesized that the acute oral administration of L-leucine alone has the ability to alter the gene expression related to fiber type and metabolism in skeletal muscle of young rats through the activation of mTOR signaling. Although the gene expression of representative glycolytic enzymes (Hk2 and Eno3) was not altered, L-leucine administration (135 mg/100 g body weight) upregulated the expression of slow-fiber-related genes (Myh7, Myl3, and Tnni1) and a mitochondrial biogenesis-related gene (Ppargc1a) in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles compared with the control. In addition, L-leucine treatment also upregulated the slow-fiber genes and mitochondrial gene expression in cultured C2C12 myotubes, whereas rapamycin inhibited the effects of L-leucine. However, L-alanine, L-phenylalanine, and L-valine treatment did not alter the expression of the fiber type- and metabolism-related genes as observed in L-leucine. Our results suggest that L-leucine may have the ability to alter skeletal muscle fiber type toward slow fiber and oxidative metabolism by upregulation of gene expression through mTOR signaling."	"The progression toward low-cost and rapid next-generation sequencing has uncovered a multitude of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in both patients and asymptomatic &quot;healthy&quot; individuals. A VUS is a rare or novel variant for which disease pathogenicity has not been conclusively demonstrated or excluded, and thus cannot be definitively annotated. VUS, therefore, pose critical clinical interpretation and risk-assessment challenges, and new methods are urgently needed to better characterize their pathogenicity.To address this challenge and showcase the uncertainty surrounding genomic variant interpretation, we recruited a &quot;healthy&quot; asymptomatic individual, lacking cardiac-disease clinical history, carrying a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)-associated genetic variant (NM_000258.2:c.170C&gt;A, NP_000249.1:p.Ala57Asp) in the sarcomeric gene MYL3, reported by the ClinVar database to be &quot;likely pathogenic.&quot; Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from the heterozygous VUS MYL3<sub>(170C&gt;A)</sub> carrier, and their genome was edited using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate 4 isogenic iPSC lines: (1) corrected &quot;healthy&quot; control; (2) homozygous VUS MYL3<sub>(170C&gt;A</sub><sub>)</sub>; (3) heterozygous frameshift mutation MYL3<sup>(170C&gt;A/fs</sup><sup>)</sup>; and (4) known heterozygous MYL3 pathogenic mutation (NM_000258.2:c.170C&gt;G), at the same nucleotide position as VUS MYL3<sub>(170C&gt;A)</sub>, lines. Extensive assays including measurements of gene expression, sarcomere structure, cell size, contractility, action potentials, and calcium handling were performed on the isogenic iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).The heterozygous VUS MYL3<sub>(170C&gt;A)</sub>-iPSC-CMs did not show an HCM phenotype at the gene expression, morphology, or functional levels. Furthermore, genome-edited homozygous VUS MYL3<sub>(170C&gt;A)</sub>- and frameshift mutation MYL3<sup>(170C&gt;A/fs)</sup>-iPSC-CMs lines were also asymptomatic, supporting a benign assessment for this particular MYL3 variant. Further assessment of the pathogenic nature of a genome-edited isogenic line carrying a known pathogenic MYL3 mutation, MYL3<sub>(170C&gt;G)</sub>, and a carrier-specific iPSC-CMs line, carrying a MYBPC3<sub>(961G&gt;A)</sub> HCM variant, demonstrated the ability of this combined platform to provide both pathogenic and benign assessments.Our study illustrates the ability of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 genome-editing of carrier-specific iPSCs to elucidate both benign and pathogenic HCM functional phenotypes in a carrier-specific manner in a dish. As such, this platform represents a promising VUS risk-assessment tool that can be used for assessing HCM-associated VUS specifically, and VUS in general, and thus significantly contribute to the arsenal of precision medicine tools available in this emerging field."	"In the poultry industry, the most important economic traits are meat quality and carcass yield. Thus, many studies were conducted to investigate the regulatory pathways during muscle differentiation. To gain insight of muscle differentiation mechanism during growth period, we identified and validated calcium-related genes which were highly expressed during muscle differentiation through mRNA sequencing analysis.We conducted next-generation-sequencing (NGS) analysis of mRNA from undifferentiated QM7 cells and differentiated QM7 cells (day 1 to day 3 of differentiation periods). Subsequently, we obtained calcium related genes related to muscle differentiation process and examined the expression patterns by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).Through RNA sequencing analysis, we found that the transcription levels of six genes (troponin C1, slow skeletal and cardiac type [TNNC1], myosin light chain 1 [MYL1], MYL3, phospholamban [PLN], caveolin 3 [CAV3], and calsequestrin 2 [CASQ2]) particularly related to calcium regulation were gradually increased according to days of myotube differentiation. Subsequently, we validated the expression patterns of calcium-related genes in quail myoblasts. These results indicated that TNNC1, MYL1, MYL3, PLN, CAV3, CASQ2 responded to differentiation and growth performance in quail muscle.These results indicated that calcium regulation might play a critical role in muscle differentiation. Thus, these findings suggest that further studies would be warranted to investigate the role of calcium ion in muscle differentiation and could provide a useful biomarker for muscle differentiation and growth."	"Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization image mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) has been developed for the identification of peptides in various tissues. The MALDI-IMS signal distribution patterns and quantification of the signal intensities of the regions of interest (ROI) with healthy regions were compared for identification of the disease specific biomarkers. We performed a new ROI analysis using the conventional t-test and data number independent Cohen's d-value analysis. Using these techniques, we analysed heart tissues after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). As a result, IMS signals of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase alpha subunit (ATP5A), myosin-6/7(MYH6/7), aortic actin, and the myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) were identified in the infarcted region. In particular, the signals of MYH7 are significantly greater in the infarcted region using ROI analysis. ROI analysis using MALDI-IMS may be a promising technique for the identification of biomarkers for pathological studies that involve the comparison of diseased and control areas."	"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Currently 60% of patients meeting Task Force Criteria (TFC) have an identifiable mutation in one of the desmosomal genes. As much overlap is described between other cardiomyopathies and ARVC, we examined the prevalence of rare, possibly pathogenic sarcomere variants in the ARVC population.One hundred and thirty-seven (137) individuals meeting 2010 TFC for a diagnosis of ARVC, negative for pathogenic desmosomal variants, TMEM43, SCN5A, and PLN were screened for variants in the sarcomere genes (ACTC1, MYBPC3, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, and TPM1) through either clinical or research genetic testing.Six probands (6/137, 4%) were found to carry rare variants in the sarcomere genes. These variants have low prevalence in controls, are predicted damaging by Polyphen-2, and some of the variants are known pathogenic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations. Sarcomere variant carriers had a phenotype that did not differ significantly from desmosomal mutation carriers. As most of these probands were the only affected individuals in their families, however, segregation data are noninformative.These data show variants in the sarcomere can be identified in individuals with an ARVC phenotype. Although rare and predicted damaging, proven functional and segregational evidence that these variants can cause ARVC is lacking. Therefore, caution is warranted in interpreting these variants when identified on large next-generation sequencing panels for cardiomyopathies."
"PRKAG2"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"PRKAG2 syndrome (PS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome that mainly presents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular preexcitation, and conduction abnormalities. Few reports have demonstrated the morphologic manifestation of patients with PRKAG2 gene defect. This case report demonstrates the cardiac magnetic resonance characteristics of the PS patients from a Chinese family."	"Paraquat (PQ) is an herbicide used in many countries, including the USA. It is also implicated as a risk factor for sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD), especially in those living in agricultural areas and drinking well water. Studies linking PQ to sPD are not consistent however and there appears to be inter-individual differential susceptibility. One likely reason is genetically based differential susceptibility to paraquat neurotoxicity in sub-populations. To address this issue, we tested the effects of paraquat in a genetic reference population of mice (the BXD recombinant inbred strain family). In our earlier work, we showed that in genetically susceptible mice, paraquat increases iron in the ventral midbrain, the area containing the substantia nigra. Our hypothesis is that genetic variability contributes to diverse PQ-related susceptibility and iron concentration. To test this hypothesis, we treated male mice from 28-39 BXD strains plus the parental strains with one of 3 doses of paraquat, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg three times on a weekly basis. At the end of the treatment period, we analyzed the ventral midbrain for concentrations of iron, copper, and zinc, also we measured the concentration of paraquat in cerebellum, and proinflammatory cytokines in serum and cerebellum. The effect on paraquat treated mice with 5 mg/kg and principal component analysis of iron showed suggestive QTL on chromosome 5. Overall, our results suggest that gene Prkag2 and related networks may serve as potential targets against paraquat toxicity and demonstrate the utility of genetically diverse mouse models for the study of complex human toxicity."	"Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, etc. Only a few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for UAE have been conducted in the European population, but not in the Asian population. Here we conducted GWAS and identified several candidate genes harboring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for UAE in the Japanese population.We conducted GWAS for UAE in 7805 individuals of Asian ancestry from health-survey data collected by Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (ToMMo) and Iwate Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (IMM). The SNP genotype data were obtained with a SNP microarray. After imputation using a haplotype panel consisting of 2000 genome sequencing, 4,962,728 SNP markers were used for the GWAS.Eighteen SNPs at 14 loci (GRM7, EXOC1/NMU, LPA, STEAP1B/RAPGEF5, SEMA3D, PRKAG2, TRIQK, SERTM1, TPT1-AS1, OR5AU1, TSHR, FMN1/RYR3, COPRS, and BRD1) were associated with UAE in the Japanese individuals. A locus with particularly strong associations was observed on TSHR, chromosome 14 [rs116622332 (p = 3.99 × 10<sup>-10</sup>)].In this study, we successfully identified UAE-associated variant loci in the Japanese population. Further study is required to confirm this association."	"Although 21 causative mutations have been associated with PRKAG2 syndrome, our understanding of the syndrome remains incomplete. The aim of this project is to further investigate its unique genetic background, clinical manifestations, and underlying structural changes.We recruited 885 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) probands and their families internationally. Targeted next-generation sequencing of sudden cardiac death (SCD) genes was performed. The role of the identified variants was assessed using histological techniques and computational modeling.Twelve PRKAG2 syndrome kindreds harboring 5 distinct variants were identified. The clinical penetrance of 25 carriers was 100.0%. Twenty-two family members died of SCD or heart failure (HF). All probands developed bradycardia (HRmin, 36.3 ± 9.8 bpm) and cardiac conduction defects, and 33% had evidence of atrial fibrillation/paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and 67% had ventricular preexcitation, respectively. Some carriers presented with apical hypertrophy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal insufficiency. Histological study revealed reduced AMPK activity and major cardiac channels in the heart tissue with K485E mutation. Computational modelling suggests that K485E disrupts the salt bridge connecting the β and γ subunits of AMPK, R302Q/P decreases the binding affinity for ATP, T400N and H401D alter the orientation of H383 and R531 residues, thus altering nucleotide binding, and N488I and L341S lead to structural instability in the Bateman domain, which disrupts the intramolecular regulation.Including 4 families with 3 new mutations, we describe a cohort of 12 kindreds with PRKAG2 syndrome with novel pathogenic mechanisms by computational modelling. Severe clinical cardiac phenotypes may be developed, including HF, requiring close follow-up."	"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a relatively common arrhythmia affecting ~1-3/1,000 individuals. Mutations in PRKAG2 have been described in rare patients in association with cardiomyopathy. However, the genetic basis of WPW in individuals with a structurally normal heart remains poorly understood. Sudden death due to atrial fibrillation (AF) can also occur in these individuals. Several studies have indicated that despite ablation of an accessory pathway, the risk of AF remains high in patients compared to general population.We applied exome sequencing in 305 subjects, including 65 trios, 80 singletons, and 6 multiple affected families. We used de novo analysis, candidate gene approach, and burden testing to explore the genetic contributions to WPW.A heterozygous deleterious variant in PRKAG2 was identified in one subject, accounting for 0.6% (1/151) of the genetic basis of WPW in this study. Another individual with WPW and left ventricular hypertrophy carried a known pathogenic variant in MYH7. We found rare de novo variants in genes associated with arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy (ANK2, NEBL, PITX2, and PRDM16) in this cohort. There was an increased burden of rare deleterious variants (MAF ≤ 0.005) with CADD score ≥ 25 in genes linked to AF in cases compared to controls (P = .0023).Our findings show an increased burden of rare deleterious variants in genes linked to AF in WPW syndrome, suggesting that genetic factors that determine the development of accessory pathways may be linked to an increased susceptibility of atrial muscle to AF in a subset of patients."	"Background Genetic testing is helpful for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mimics. Little data are available regarding the yield of such testing and its clinical impact. Methods The HCM genetic database at our center was used for identification of patients who underwent HCM-directed genetic testing including at least 1 gene associated with an HCM mimic (<i>GLA</i>, <i>TTR</i>, <i>PRKAG2</i>, <i>LAMP2</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, and <i>DES</i>). Charts were retrospectively reviewed and genetic and clinical data extracted. Results There were 1731 unrelated HCM patients who underwent genetic testing for at least 1 gene related to an HCM mimic. In 1.45% of cases, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in one of these genes was identified. This included a yield of 1% for Fabry disease, 0.3% for familial amyloidosis, 0.15% for <i>PRKAG2</i>-related cardiomyopathy, and 1 patient with Noonan syndrome. In the majority of patients, diagnosis of the HCM mimic based on clinical findings alone would have been challenging. Accurate diagnosis of an HCM mimic led to change in management (eg, enzyme replacement therapy) or family screening in all cases. Conclusions Genetic testing is helpful in the diagnosis of HCM mimics in patients with no or few extracardiac manifestations. Adding these genes to all HCM genetic panels should be considered."	"Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a common type of colon cancer, and post-operative recurrence and metastasis may occur in COAD patients. This study is designed to build a risk score system for COAD patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of COAD (the training set) was downloaded, and GSE17538 and GSE39582 (the validation sets) from Gene Expression Omnibus database were obtained. The differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) were analyzed by limma package. Using survival package, the independent prognosis-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were selected for constructing risk score system. After the independent clinical prognostic factors were screened out using survival package, a nomogram survival model was constructed using rms package. Furthermore, competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network and enrichment analyses separately were performed using Cytoscape software and DAVID tool. Totally 404 DERs between recurrence and non-recurrence groups were identified. Based on the six independent prognosis-associated lncRNAs (including <i>H19, KCNJ2-AS1, LINC00899, LINC01503, PRKAG2-AS1</i>, and <i>SRRM2-AS1</i>), the risk score system was constructed. After the independent clinical prognostic factors (Pathologic M, pathologic T, and RS model status) were identified, the nomogram survival model was built. In the ceRNA regulatory network, there were three lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and 77 mRNAs. Additionally, PPAR signaling pathway and hedgehog signaling pathway were enriched for the mRNAs in the ceRNA regulatory network. The risk score system and the nomogram survival model might be used for predicting COAD recurrence. Besides, PPAR signaling pathway and hedgehog signaling pathway might affect the recurrence of COAD patients."	"Increased amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation associated with abnormal autophagy-lysosomal activity and nutrient kinase dysregulation are common features in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Recent studies have identified PRKAG2 and TIPRL genes that control nutrient kinase regulated autophagy, and here we determined if their expression is altered in postmortem AD brains. Gene and protein expression of TIPRL were unchanged. However, gene expression of PRKAG2 was increased 3-fold and its protein levels positively correlated with Aβ accumulation in the AD brain. In summary, our findings suggest that increased PRKAG2 is an important contributing factor to Aβ accumulation in the AD brain."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Whole-exome sequencing studies have shown that de novo single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) play an important role in sporadic ASD. The present study aimed to search for de novo SNVs using whole-exome sequencing in 59 unrelated Chinese ASD sporadic trios, and found 24 genes (including five reported ASD candidate genes CACNA1D, ACHE, YY1, TTN, and FBXO11) with de novo harmful SNVs. Five genes (CACNA1D, JAK2, ACHE, MAPK7, and PRKAG2) classified as &quot;medium-confidence&quot; genes were found to be related to ASD using the Phenolyzer gene analysis tool, which predicts the correlation between the candidate genes and the ASD phenotype. De novo SNVs in JAK2, MAPK7, and PRKAG2 were first found in ASD. Both JAK2 and MAPK7 were involved in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Gene co-expression and inter-gene interaction networks were constructed and gene expression data in different brain regions were further extracted, revealing that JAK2 and MAPK7 genes were associated with certain previously reported ASD genes and played an important role in early brain development. The findings of this study suggest that the aforementioned five reported ASD genes and JAK2 and MAPK7 may be related to ASD susceptibility. Further investigations of expression studies in cellular and animal models are needed to explore the mechanism underlying the involvement of JAK2 and MAPK7 in ASD."	"We describe the case of a novel PRKAG2 mutation that manifested with a ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest in a child. The previously healthy 13-year old boy, was subsequently diagnosed with Wolff-White-Parkinson syndrome, mild left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation. His father had also been diagnosed in the past with Wolff-White-Parkinson syndrome and developed left ventricular hypertrophy. A novel heterozygous likely pathogenic variant, c.911C&gt;G, p.Ala304Gly was identified in the father and his son, which is absent from population databases. PRKAG2 gene variants have previously been shown to cause a familial syndrome of ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular pre-excitation, supraventricular tachycardia, and conduction abnormalities. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of this rare syndrome manifesting with a more severe phenotype in a second generation relative within the same family."	"Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme and central regulator of cellular energy metabolism. The impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all 7 AMPK subunit genes on adiposity, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism has not yet been systematically studied.To analyze the associations of common SNPs in all AMPK genes, and of different scores thereof, with adiposity, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.A cohort of 2789 nondiabetic participants from the Tübingen Family study of type 2 diabetes, metabolically characterized by oral glucose tolerance test and genotyped by genome-wide SNP array, was analyzed.We identified 6 largely nonoverlapping SNP sets across 4 AMPK genes (PRKAA1, PRKAA2, PRKAG2, PRKAG3) associated with adiposity, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, blood glucose, total/LDL cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol, respectively. A genetic score of body-fat-increasing alleles revealed per-allele effect sizes on body mass index (BMI) of +0.22 kg/m2 (P = 2.3 × 10-7), insulin sensitivity of -0.12 × 1019 L2/mol2 (P = 9.9 × 10-6) and 2-hour blood glucose of +0.02 mmol/L (P = 0.0048). Similar effects on blood glucose were observed with scores of insulin-sensitivity-reducing, insulin-secretion-reducing and glucose-raising alleles, respectively. A genetic cholesterol score increased total and LDL cholesterol by 1.17 mg/dL per allele (P = 0.0002 and P = 3.2 × 10-5, respectively), and a genetic HDL score decreased HDL cholesterol by 0.32 mg/dL per allele (P = 9.1 × 10-6).We describe largely nonoverlapping genetic determinants in AMPK genes for diabetes-/atherosclerosis-related traits, which reflect the metabolic pathways controlled by the enzyme. Formation of trait-specific genetic scores revealed additivity of allele effects, with body-fat-raising alleles reaching a marked effect size. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab XX: 0-0, 2019)."	"PRKAG2 syndrome (PS) is a rare, early-onset autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by mutations in PRKAG2, the gene encoding the regulatory γ2 subunit of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. PRKAG2 syndrome is associated with many cardiac manifestations, including pre-excitation, arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy, and chronotropic incompetence frequently leading to early pacemaker placement. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association data in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) identified a susceptibility locus in an intron of PRKAG2, which has been replicated in other studies. However, CKD has not been reported in patients with PS or mutations in PRKAG2.We report a case of a woman diagnosed at age 27 with PS when she presented with atrial fibrillation and pre-excitation on electrocardiogram. By age 35, she had developed mild renal insufficiency and a biopsy demonstrated IgA nephropathy (IGAN).This is the first reported case of IGAN in a patient with PS. We discuss both PS and IGAN and the potential mechanisms by which they could be related."	"The deletion of the distal 7q region is a rare chromosomal syndrome characterized by wide phenotypic manifestations including growth and psychomotor delay, facial dysmorphisms, and genitourinary malformations.We describe a 6-year-old child with a 12-Mb deletion of the region 7q35q36.3.Among the deleted genes, two genes have cardiac implications: PRKAG2 (OMIM #602743), associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac conduction disease, and sudden death, and KCNH2 (OMIM #152427), coding for a cardiac potassium channel involved in long QT syndrome, unmasked by the chlorpheniramine treatment. At same time, the SHH gene (OMIM #600725), encoding sonic hedgehog, a secreted protein that is involved in the embryonic development, is deleted.Our report underlines potential cardiac complications linked to the common pharmacological treatment in this rare multiorgan and proteiform disease."	"A multi-disciplinary approach to promote engagement, inform decision-making and support clinicians and patients is increasingly advocated to realise the potential of genome-scale sequencing in the clinic for patient benefit. Here we describe the results of establishing a genomic medicine multi-disciplinary team (GM-MDT) for case selection, processing, interpretation and return of results.We report a consecutive case series of 132 patients (involving 10 medical specialties with 43.2% cases having a neurological disorder) undergoing exome sequencing over a 10-month period following the establishment of the GM-MDT in a UK NHS tertiary referral hospital. The costs of running the MDT are also reported.In total 76 cases underwent exome sequencing following triage by the GM-MDT with a clinically reportable molecular diagnosis in 24 (31.6%). GM-MDT composition, operation and rationale for whether to proceed to sequencing are described, together with the health economics (cost per case for the GM-MDT was £399.61), the utility and informativeness of exome sequencing for molecular diagnosis in a range of traits, the impact of choice of sequencing strategy on molecular diagnostic rates and challenge of defining pathogenic variants. In 5 cases (6.6%), an alternative clinical diagnosis was indicated by sequencing results. Examples were also found where findings from initial genetic testing were reconsidered in the light of exome sequencing including TP63 and PRKAG2 (detection of a partial exon deletion and a mosaic missense pathogenic variant respectively); together with tissue-specific mosaicism involving a cytogenetic abnormality following a normal prenatal array comparative genomic hybridization.This consecutive case series describes the results and experience of a multidisciplinary team format that was found to promote engagement across specialties and facilitate return of results to the responsible clinicians."	"Selection of antihypertensive treatment according to self-defined ethnicity is recommended by some guidelines but might be better guided by individual genotype rather than ethnicity or race. We compared the extent to which variation in blood pressure response across different ethnicities may be explained by genetic factors: genetically defined ancestry and gene variants at loci known to be associated with blood pressure. We analyzed data from 5 trials in which genotyping had been performed (n=4696) and in which treatment responses to β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic and calcium channel blocker were available. Genetically defined ancestry for proportion of African ancestry was computed using the 1000 genomes population database as a reference. Differences in response to the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the β-blockers atenolol and metoprolol, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, and the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan were more closely associated to genetically defined ancestry than self-defined ethnicity in admixed subjects. A relatively small number of gene variants related to loci associated with drug-signaling pathways (KCNK3, SULT1C3, AMH, PDE3A, PLCE1, PRKAG2) with large effect size (-3.5 to +3.5 mm Hg difference in response per allele) and differing allele frequencies in black versus white individuals explained a large proportion of the difference in response to candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide between these groups. These findings suggest that a genomic precision medicine approach can be used to individualize antihypertensive treatment within and across populations without recourse to surrogates of genetic structure such as self-defined ethnicity."	"PRKAG2 is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome that mainly presents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular preexcitation, and conduction abnormalities. This case report demonstrates that the PRKAG2 mutation presents with various phenotypes already in pediatric patients.We describe the clinical and investigative findings in two families with a PRKAG2 mutation from the different variants in the gene on chromosome 7q36.1, emphasising that the variability of phenotypes and that presentation in childhood is common. Furthermore, we highlight that skeletal myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are significant debilitating characteristics of the PRKAG2 mutation.In our report of adult and pediatric patients, early presentation in childhood with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle involvement was common, demonstrating the challenges of the clinical management of PRKAG2 mutations."	"The liver kinase B1-AMP-activated protein kinase (LKB1-AMPK) pathway has been identified as a new target for cancer therapy, because it controls the glucose and lipid metabolism in response to alterations in nutrients and intracellular energy levels. In the present study, we aimed to identify genetic variants of the LKB1-AMPK pathway genes and their associations with pancreatic cancer (PanC) risk using 15 418 participants of European ancestry from two previously published PanC genome-wide association studies. We found that six novel tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (i.e, MAP2 rs35075084 T &gt; deletion, PRKAG2 rs2727572 C &gt; T and rs34852782 A &gt; deletion, TP53 rs9895829 A &gt; G, and RPTOR rs62068300 G &gt; A and rs3751936 G &gt; C) were significantly associated with an increased PanC risk. The multivariate logistic regression model incorporating the number of unfavorable genotypes (NUGs) with adjustment for age and sex showed that carriers with five to six NUGs had an increased PanC risk (odds ratio = 1.24, 95% confidence interval = 1.16-1.32 and P &lt; 0.0001), compared to those with zero to four NUGs. Subsequent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis further revealed that these SNPs were associated with significantly altered mRNA expression levels either in 373 normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (TP53 SNP rs9895829, P &lt; 0.05) or in whole blood cells of 369 normal donors from the genotype-tissue expression project (GTEx) database [RPTOR SNP rs60268947 and rs28434589, both in high linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2</sup>  &gt; 0.9) withRPTOR rs62068300, P &lt; 0.001]. Collectively, our findings suggest that these novel SNPs in the LKB1-AMPK pathway genes may modify susceptibility to PanC, possibly by influencing gene expression."	"Myocyte disarray of &gt;10% in the heart is broadly accepted as a diagnostic pitfall for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) at postmortem. The present study aims to propose an additional diagnostic criterion of HCM. Heart specimens from 1387 serial forensic autopsy cases were examined. Cases with myocyte disarray were extracted and applied to morphometric analysis to determine the amount of myocyte disarray. Comprehensive genetic analysis by using next-generation sequencing was subsequently applied for cases with myocyte disarray. Fifteen cases with myocyte disarray were extracted as candidate cases (1.1%, 11 men and 4 women, aged 48⁻94 years). In terms of the cause of death, only 2 cases were cardiac or possible cardiac death, and the other was non-cardiac death. Six cases showed myocyte disarray of &gt;10% and 3 cases showed myocyte disarray of 5% to 10%. The other 6 cases showed myocyte disarray of &lt;5%. Nine rare variants in 5 HCM-related genes (MYBPC3, MYH7, MYH6, PRKAG2, and CAV3) were found in 8 of 9 cases with myocyte disarray of &gt;5%. The remaining 1 and 6 cases with myocyte disarray of &lt;5% did not have any such variant. Myocyte disarray of &gt;5% with rare variants in related genes might be an appropriate postmortem diagnostic criterion for HCM, in addition to myocyte disarray of 10%."	"Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) are furthering our knowledge of epigenetic modifications involved in the regulation of lipids' metabolism. Furthermore, epigenetic patterns associated with lipid levels may play an important role in predicting the occurrence of cardiovascular events. To further investigate the relationship between methylation status and lipids, we performed an EWAS in 211 individuals from the STANISLAS Family study (SFS). Methylation at two CpG sites (<i>PRKAG2</i>; <i>p</i> = 1.39 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; <i>KREMEN2</i>; <i>p</i> = 5.75 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) were significantly associated with lipidomic profiles. Replication was sought in adipose tissue where one probe, cg08897188, was found to be nominally significant (<i>KREMEN2</i>; <i>p</i> = 0.0196). These results could provide new insight in the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases and contribute to new therapeutic interventions."	NA
"TNNI3"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"Troponin (TNN)-encoded cardiac troponins (Tn) are critical for sensing calcium and triggering myofilament contraction. TNN variants are associated with development of cardiomyopathy; however, recent advances in genetic analysis have identified rare population variants. It is unclear how certain variants are associated with disease while others are tolerated.To compare probands with TNNT2, TNNI3, and TNNC1 variants and utilize high-resolution variant comparison mapping of pathologic and rare population variants to identify loci associated with disease pathogenesis.Cardiomyopathy-associated TNN variants were identified in the literature and topology mapping conducted. Clinical features were compiled and compared. Rare population variants were obtained from the gnomAD database. Signal-to-noise (S:N) normalized pathologic variant frequency against population variant frequency. Abstract review of clinical phenotypes was applied to &quot;significant&quot; hot spots.Probands were compiled (N = 70 studies, 224 probands) as were rare variants (N = 125,748 exomes; 15,708 genomes, MAF &lt;0.001). TNNC1-positive probands demonstrated the youngest age of presentation (20.0 years; P = .016 vs TNNT2; P = .004 vs TNNI3) and the highest death, transplant, or ventricular fibrillation events (P = .093 vs TNNT2; P = .024 vs TNNI3; Kaplan Meir: P = .025). S:N analysis yielded hot spots of diagnostic significance within the tropomyosin-binding domains, α-helix 1, and the N-Terminus in TNNT2 with increased sudden cardiac death and ventricular fibrillation (P = .004). The inhibitory region and C-terminal region in TNNI3 exhibited increased restrictive cardiomyopathy (P =.008). HCM and RCM models tended to have increased calcium sensitivity and DCM decreased sensitivity (P &lt; .001). DCM and HCM studies typically showed no differences in Hill coefficient which was decreased in RCM models (P &lt; .001). CM models typically demonstrated no changes to F<sub>max</sub> (P = .239).TNNC1-positive probands had younger ages of diagnosis and poorer clinical outcomes. Mapping of TNN variants identified locations in TNNT2 and TNNI3 associated with heightened pathogenicity, RCM diagnosis, and increased risk of sudden death."	"TNNI3 encoding cTnI, the inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex, is the main target for mutations leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Here we investigate two cTnI-R170G/W amino acid replacements, identified in infantile RCM patients, which are located in the regulatory C-terminus of cTnI. The C-terminus is thought to modulate the function of the inhibitory region of cTnI. Both cTnI-R170G/W strongly enhanced the Ca2+-sensitivity of skinned fibres, as is typical for RCM-mutations. Both mutants strongly enhanced the affinity of troponin (cTn) to tropomyosin compared to wildtype cTn, whereas binding to actin was either strengthened (R170G) or weakened (R170W). Furthermore, the stability of reconstituted thin filaments was reduced as revealed by electron microscopy. Filaments containing R170G/W appeared wavy and showed breaks. Decoration of filaments with myosin subfragment S1 was normal in the presence of R170W, but was irregular with R170G. Surprisingly, both mutants did not affect the Ca2+-dependent activation of reconstituted cardiac thin filaments. In the presence of the N-terminal fragment of cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC-C0C2) cooperativity of thin filament activation was increased only when the filaments contained wildtype cTn. No effect was observed in the presence of cTn containing R170G/W. cMyBPC-C0C2 significantly reduced binding of wildtype troponin to actin/tropomyosin, but not of both mutant cTn. Moreover, we found a direct troponin/cMyBPC-C0C2 interaction using microscale thermophoresis and identified cTnI and cTnT, but not cTnC as binding partners for cMyBPC-C0C2. Only cTn containing cTnI-R170G showed a reduced affinity towards cMyBPC-C0C2. Our results suggest that the RCM cTnI variants R170G/W impair the communication between thin and thick filament proteins and destabilize thin filaments."	"Sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) affects children &gt;1-year-old whose cause of death remains unexplained following comprehensive case investigation and is often associated with hippocampal abnormalities. We prospectively performed systematic neuropathologic investigation in 20 SUDC cases, including (i) autopsy data and comprehensive ancillary testing, including molecular studies, (ii) ex vivo 3T MRI and extensive histologic brain samples, and (iii) blinded neuropathology review by 2 board-certified neuropathologists. There were 12 girls and 8 boys; median age at death was 33.3 months. Twelve had a history of febrile seizures, 85% died during apparent sleep and 80% in prone position. Molecular testing possibly explained 3 deaths and identified genetic mutations in TNNI3, RYR2, and multiple chromosomal aberrations. Hippocampal abnormalities most often affected the dentate gyrus (altered thickness, irregular configuration, and focal lack of granule cells), and had highest concordance between reviewers. Findings were identified with similar frequencies in cases with and without molecular findings. Number of seizures did not correlate with hippocampal findings. Hippocampal alterations were the most common finding on histological review but were also found in possibly explained deaths. The significance and specificity of hippocampal findings is unclear as they may result from seizures, contribute to seizure pathogenesis, or be an unrelated phenomenon."	"The aim of this study was to identify the genetic causes of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) within a family. Most of the previous studies found point mutations as the genetic causes for HCM, whole-gene deletion was rarely reported.Although, clinical genetic testing has been widely used for identifying variants in HCM patients, structural variations are understudied, partly owing to the inadequacy of the available methodology. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing validation was used to identify the genetic causes in patients with familial HCM.A genomic deletion in Chromosome 19 containing the whole of troponin I3 gene (TNNI3), and the p.Ile736Thr variant in the myosin heavy chain 7 gene (MYH7) were identified in two patients with familial HCM by WES. The p.Ile736Thr variant is further validated by Sanger sequencing and is predicted as a pathogenic variant by in silico analysis.We added the notion that not only p.Ile736Thr variant of MYH7, but also TNNI3 deletion might potentially contribute to HCM pathogenesis. Our study also suggested WES was a powerful tool to identify the genetic variants causing HCM."	"Clinical trials using human adipogenic mesenchymal stem cells (hAdMSCs) for the treatment of cardiac diseases have shown improvement in cardiac function and were proven safe. However, hAdMSCs do not convert efficiently into cardiomyocytes (CMs) or vasculature. Thus, reprogramming hAdMSCs into myocyte progenitors may fare better in future investigations. To reprogramme hAdMSCs into electrically conductive cardiac progenitor cells, we pioneered a three-step reprogramming strategy that uses proven MESP1/ETS2 transcription factors, β-adrenergic and hypoxic signalling induced in three-dimensional (3D) cardiospheres. In Stage 1, ETS2 and MESP1 activated NNKX2.5, TBX5, MEF2C, dHAND, and GATA4 during the conversion of hAdMSCs into cardiac progenitor cells. Next, in Stage 2, β2AR activation repositioned cardiac progenitors into de novo immature conductive cardiac cells, along with the appearance of RYR2, CAV2.1, CAV3.1, NAV1.5, SERCA2, and CX45 gene transcripts and displayed action potentials. In Stage 3, electrical conduction that was fostered by 3D cardiospheres formed in a Synthecon®, Inc. rotating bioreactor induced the appearance of hypoxic genes: HIF-1α/β, PCG 1α/β, and NOS2, which coincided with the robust activation of adult contractile genes including MLC2v, TNNT2, and TNNI3, ion channel genes, and the appearance of hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN1-4). Conduction velocities doubled to ~200 mm/s after hypoxia and doubled yet again after dissociation of the 3D cell clusters to ~400 mm/s. By comparison, normal conduction velocities within working ventricular myocytes in the whole heart range from 0.5 to 1 m/s. Epinephrine stimulation of stage 3 cardiac cells in patches resulted in an increase in amplitude of the electrical wave, indicative of conductive cardiac cells. Our efficient protocol that converted hAdMSCs into highly conductive cardiac progenitors demonstrated the potential utilization of stage 3 cells for tissue engineering applications for cardiac repair."	"Delivery of stem cells to the failing heart is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, the improvement in cardiac function in animal studies has not fully translated to humans. To help bridge the gap between species, we investigated the effects of adult human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) on contractile function of human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs) as a species-specific model of the human myocardium.Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyoctes (hCMs) were mixed with Collagen/Matrigel to fabricate control hECTs, with an experimental group of hCSC-supplemented hECT fabricated using a 9:1 ratio of hCM to hCSC. Functional testing was performed starting on culture day 6, under spontaneous conditions and also during electrical pacing from 0.25 to 1.0 Hz, measurements repeated at days 8 and 10. hECTs were then frozen and processed for gene analysis using a Nanostring assay with a cardiac targeted custom panel.The hCSC-supplemented hECTs displayed a twofold higher developed force vs. hCM-only controls by day 6, with approximately threefold higher developed stress and maximum rates of contraction and relaxation during pacing at 0.75 Hz. The spontaneous beat rate characteristics were similar between groups, and hCSC supplementation did not adversely impact beat rate variability. The increased contractility persisted through days 8 and 10, albeit with some decrease in the magnitude of the difference of the force by day 10, but with developed stress still significantly higher in hCSC-supplemented hECT; these findings were confirmed with multiple hCSC and hCM cell lines. The force-frequency relationship, while negative for both, control (- 0.687 Hz<sup>- 1</sup>; p = 0.013 vs. zero) and hCSC-supplemented (- 0.233 Hz<sup>- 1</sup>;p = 0.067 vs. zero) hECTs, showed a significant rectification in the regression slope in hCSC-supplemented hECT (p = 0.011 vs. control). Targeted gene exploration (59 genes) identified a total of 14 differentially expressed genes, with increases in the ratios of MYH7/MHY6, MYL2/MYL7, and TNNI3/TNNI1 in hCSC-supplemented hECT versus controls.For the first time, hCSC supplementation was shown to significantly improve human cardiac tissue contractility in vitro, without evidence of proarrhythmic effects, and was associated with increased expression of markers of cardiac maturation. These findings provide new insights about adult cardiac stem cells as contributors to functional improvement of human myocardium."	"Current differentiation protocols to produce cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of generating highly pure cardiomyocyte populations as determined by expression of cardiac troponin T. However, these cardiomyocytes remain immature, more closely resembling the fetal state, with a lower maximum contractile force, slower upstroke velocity, and immature mitochondrial function compared with adult cardiomyocytes. Immaturity of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes may be a significant barrier to clinical translation of cardiomyocyte cell therapies for heart disease. During development, cardiomyocytes undergo a shift from a proliferative state in the fetus to a more mature but quiescent state after birth. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-signaling pathway plays a key role in nutrient sensing and growth. We hypothesized that transient inhibition of the mTOR-signaling pathway could lead cardiomyocytes to a quiescent state and enhance cardiomyocyte maturation.Cardiomyocytes were differentiated from 3 human iPSC lines using small molecules to modulate the Wnt pathway. Torin1 (0 to 200 nmol/L) was used to inhibit the mTOR pathway at various time points. We quantified contractile, metabolic, and electrophysiological properties of matured iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. We utilized the small molecule inhibitor, pifithrin-α, to inhibit p53 signaling, and nutlin-3a, a small molecule inhibitor of MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog) to upregulate and increase activation of p53.Torin1 (200 nmol/L) increased the percentage of quiescent cells (G<sub>0</sub> phase) from 24% to 48% compared with vehicle control (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Torin1 significantly increased expression of selected sarcomere proteins (including TNNI3 [troponin I, cardiac muscle]) and ion channels (including Kir2.1) in a dose-dependent manner when Torin1 was initiated after onset of cardiomyocyte beating. Torin1-treated cells had an increased relative maximum force of contraction, increased maximum oxygen consumption rate, decreased peak rise time, and increased downstroke velocity. Torin1 treatment increased protein expression of p53, and these effects were inhibited by pifithrin-α. In contrast, nutlin-3a independently upregulated p53, led to an increase in TNNI3 expression and worked synergistically with Torin1 to further increase expression of both p53 and TNNI3.Transient treatment of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with Torin1 shifts cells to a quiescent state and enhances cardiomyocyte maturity."	"The underlying genetic mechanisms and early pathological events of children with primary cardiomyopathy (CMP) are insufficiently characterized. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mutational spectrum of primary CMP in a large cohort of patients ≤18 years referred to a tertiary center. Eighty unrelated index patients with pediatric primary CMP underwent genetic testing with a panel-based next-generation sequencing approach of 89 genes. At least one pathogenic or probably pathogenic variant was identified in 30/80 (38%) index patients. In all CMP subgroups, patients carried most frequently variants of interest in sarcomere genes suggesting them as a major contributor in pediatric primary CMP. In MYH7, MYBPC3, and TNNI3, we identified 18 pathogenic/probably pathogenic variants (MYH7 n = 7, MYBPC3 n = 6, TNNI3 n = 5, including one homozygous (TNNI3 c.24+2T&gt;A) truncating variant. Protein and transcript level analysis on heart biopsies from individuals with homozygous mutation of TNNI3 revealed that the TNNI3 protein is absent and associated with upregulation of the fetal isoform TNNI1. The present study further supports the clinical importance of sarcomeric mutation-not only in adult-but also in pediatric primary CMP. TNNI3 is the third most important disease gene in this cohort and complete loss of TNNI3 leads to severe pediatric CMP."	"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are a unique source of human cardiomyocytes for cardiac disease modeling. Incomplete functional maturation remains a major limitation, however. One of the determinants of iPSC-CM maturation is somatic cell origin. We therefore compared iPSC-CMs derived from different somatic cell sources.Cardiac-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (CPCs), bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMCs), and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) from same patients were reprogrammed into iPSCs and differentiated into iPSC-CMs. Expression of cardiac-specific genes, caffeine-responsive cells, and electrophysiological properties of differentiated cells were analyzed. To assess the contribution of epigenetic memory toward differences in gene expression observed during cardiac differentiation, DNA methylation patterns were determined in the early mesodermal cardiac promoter NKX2-5 and KCNQ1, which encodes for the pore-forming α-subunit of the slow component of delayed-rectifier potassium current (I<sub>Ks</sub>).Cardiac genes (MYH6, TNNI3, KCNQ1, KCNE1) were upregulated in CPC-vs. BMC- and HDF-iPSC-CMs. At early differentiation stages, CPC-iPSC-CMs displayed higher numbers of caffeine-responsive cells than BMC- and HDF-iPSC-CMs. The hERG1 (KV11.1) blocker, E4031, followed by the IKs blocker, JNJ303, increased extracellular field potential duration in CPC-iPSC-CMs to a greater extent than in BMC- and HDF-iPSC-CMs. The promoter region of NKX2-5 was more highly methylated in BMCs and HDFs compared to CPCs, and to a lesser extent in BMC-iPSCs compared to CPC-iPSCs.These results suggest that human iPSCs from cardiac somatic cell sources may display enhanced capacity toward cardiac re-differentiation compared to non-cardiac cell sources, and that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in this regard."	"Establishing connections between changes in linear DNA sequences and complex downstream mesoscopic pathology remains a major challenge in biology. Herein, we report a novel, multi-modal and multiscale imaging approach for comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular physiology in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> We employed high-speed angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy to reveal functional and structural abnormalities in the <i>hdp<sup>2</sup></i> mutant, pre-pupal heart tube and aorta relative to controls. <i>hdp<sup>2</sup></i> harbor a mutation in <i>wupA</i>, which encodes an ortholog of human troponin I (<i>TNNI3</i>). <i>TNNI3</i> variants frequently engender cardiomyopathy. We demonstrate that the <i>hdp<sup>2</sup></i> aortic and cardiac muscle walls are disrupted and that shorter sarcomeres are associated with smaller, stiffer aortas, which consequently result in increased flow and pulse wave velocities. The mutant hearts also displayed diastolic and latent systolic dysfunction. We conclude that <i>hdp<sup>2</sup></i> pre-pupal hearts are exposed to increased afterload due to aortic hypoplasia. This may in turn contribute to diastolic and subtle systolic dysfunction via vascular-heart tube interaction, which describes the effect of the arterial loading system on cardiac function. Ultimately, the cardiovascular pathophysiology caused by a point mutation in a sarcomeric protein demonstrates that complex and dynamic micro- and mesoscopic phenotypes can be mechanistically explained in a gene sequence- and molecular-specific manner."	"Gene expression has become an interesting research area in forensic pathology to investigate the process of death at the molecular level. The aims of this study were to analyze changes in gene expression patterns in relation to the cause of death, and to propose new molecular markers of myocardial ischemia of potential use for the postmortem diagnosis of early ischemic heart damage in cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD). We determined mRNA levels of five proteins related with ischemic myocardial damage and repair - TNNI3, MYL3, TGFB1, MMP9 and VEGFA - in specific sites of the myocardium, blood and pericardial fluid in samples from 30 cadavers with different causes of death (SCD, multiple trauma, mechanical asphyxia, and other natural deaths). TNNI3 expression in blood, and MMP9 expression in pericardial fluid, were significantly higher when the cause of death was mechanical asphyxia, probably because of the more sensitive response of these proteins to acute systemic hypoxia/ischemia. Specifically, among SCD cases, increased MYL3, VEGFA and MMP9 values in the anterior wall of the right ventricle were found when the confirmed cause of death was acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Higher TGFB1 expression was found in the interventricular septum when AMI was not the cause of death, most likely as a reflection of the short duration of ischemia. Molecular biology techniques can provide complementary tools for the forensic diagnosis of early ischemic myocardial damage and AMI, and may make it possible to determine the duration and severity of myocardial ischemia."	"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated primarily with pathogenic mutations in sarcomeric genes. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and distribution of disease-causing mutations in HCM-associated genes and the genotype-phenotype relationship in Vietnamese patients with HCM.Methods and Results:Genetic testing was performed by next-generation sequencing in 104 unrelated probands for 23 HCM-related genes and in 57 family members for the mutation(s) detected. Clinical manifestations were recorded for genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. Mutation detection rate was 43.4%. Mutations inMYBPC3accounted for 38.6%, followed byTPM1(20.5%),MYH7(18.2%),TNNT2(9.1%),TNNI3(4.5%) andMYL2(2.3%). A mutation inGLAassociated with Fabry disease was found in 1 patient. A mutation inTPM1(c.842T&gt;C, p.Met281Thr) was identified in 8 unrelated probands (18.2%) and 8 family members from 5 probands. Genotype-positive status related toMYH7,TPM1, andTNNT2mutations was associated with severe clinical manifestations.MYH7-positive patients displayed worse prognosis compared withMYBPC3-positive patients. Interestingly,TPM1c.842T&gt;C mutation was associated with high penetrance and severe HCM phenotype.We report for the first time the prevalence of HCM-related gene variants in Vietnamese patients with HCM.MYH7,TPM1, andTNNT2mutations were associated with unfavorable prognosis."	"<b>                        <i>Introduction:</i>                    </b> The adaptive response to systemic intermittent hypoxic therapy (SIHT) may be used for therapeutic advances due to the activation of multiple pathways involved in angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and tissue homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the early age-dependent systemic response of different exposures of SIHT in mice. <b>                        <i>Materials and Methods:</i>                    </b> Sixty-four C57BL/6NRj female mice in three different age groups, young (4-5 weeks), adolescent (8-10 weeks), and adults (23-32 weeks), were exposed to SIHT. Different algorithms for equal hypoxic challenges (oxygen-decrease*time) were investigated to allow examination of the role of absolute hypoxia (oxygen-decrease) compared with relative hypoxia (total oxygen depletion over time). The systemic effects of angiogenetic regulation were investigated using blood samples analyzed by ELISA, proteome profiles, and proximity extension immunoassay. One-way analysis of variance with <i>post hoc</i> Bonferroni analyses was performed. <b>                        <i>Results:</i>                    </b> The early systemic response to SIHT was dependent on the absolute hypoxia rather than relative hypoxia over time. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels were increased significantly in young mice receiving low-oxygen SIHT treatments (10% and 15% oxygen). The expression of angiogenic proteins differed between the different age groups indicating an age-dependent response to SIHT. Focusing on hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling, there was a trend toward upregulated angiogenetic response with younger age. Furthermore, clustering of protein expression in low-oxygen SIHT algorithms were found between young and adolescent mice. In adult mice, the majority of the proteins were downregulated as a response to SIHT. The systemic response of metabolites expressions was most pronounced in young mice. Systemic levels of cardiac troponin I (Tnni3) was unaffected by SIHT independent of age groups. <b>                        <i>Conclusions:</i>                    </b> The systemic response to SIHT is dependent on the absolute hypoxic exposure rather than the relative hypoxic depletion over time. Age-dependent effects of a short-term SIHT were associated with an increase in EPO, upregulation of angiogenetic pathways, and select metabolic and cell-surface proteins."	"Troponin I (TnI) is the inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex in the sarcomeric thin filament of striated muscle and plays a central role in the calcium regulation of contraction and relaxation. Vertebrate TnI has evolved into three isoforms encoded by three homologous genes: TNNI1 for slow skeletal muscle TnI, TNNI2 for fast skeletal muscle TnI and TNNI3 for cardiac TnI, which are expressed under muscle type-specific and developmental regulations in both the atrium and ventricle of the heart. Skeletal muscle TnI (both sTnI iso-forms) have been proposed as a sensitive and fast fiber-specific serum marker of skeletal muscle damage; fsTnI concentration in increased peripheral blood when fast twitch fibers were damaged. In our study we investigate if the 'Troponin I, fast skeletal muscle' can also be used as a reliable diagnostic tool in forensic practice, to perform differential diagnosis about vitality in suicide by hanging and simulated hanging (suspension of the victim after murder). We selected 8 women and 13 men, mean age 52.2 years, who died from suicidal hanging. The ligature material used for hanging was soft material in 11 cases and hard material in 10 cases. We chose cases as a control group of adults (n = 10; six women, four men, mean age 47.3 years) that died from opioid overdose (n = 2), car accident (n = 3) and sudden cardiac death (n = 5). Those deaths were characterized by their rapidity. To test the Anti-Troponin I fast skeletal muscle Antibody (Abcam clone-134,838), we used a case of a subject who died of myocardial infarction (timing infarct dated to 24-36 h prior to death). The reactions to Troponin I (namely the amount and extent of marker depletion) was scored for each section from 0 to -3: 0 = no loss of staining; -1 = minimal decrease in staining, compared to normally stained tissue; -2 = clear decrease in staining with some positivity (brown color) remaining; and -3 = no positive (brown) staining. The set of results obtained leads us to believe that the use of this antibody (Anti-Troponin I fast skeletal muscle antibody) is very promising to be able to make a certain differential diagnosis between antemortem and postmortem hangings. It should be emphasized that the present study seems to open new and promising horizons in the possibility to discriminate between suicidal hanging and simulated hanging (suspension of the victim after murder)."	"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratification in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), even though SCD may occur with LVEF &gt; 35%. Family history of unexplained SCD, especially in the young, raises concern about potential inheritable risk factors. It remains largely unknown how genetic tests can be integrated into clinical practice, particularly in the selection of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) candidates. We aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of genetic testing in DCM patients with a class I recommendation for ICD implantation, based on current guidelines.We included ambulatory stable adult patients with idiopathic or familial DCM with previously implanted ICD. Molecular analysis included 15 genes (<i>LMNA</i>, <i>MYH7</i>, <i>MYBPC3</i>, <i>TNNT2</i>, <i>ACTC1</i>, <i>TPM1</i>, <i>CSRP3</i>, <i>TCAP</i>, <i>SGCD</i>, <i>PLN</i>, <i>MYL2</i>, <i>MYL3</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>TAZ</i>, and <i>LDB3</i>) using next-generation sequencing.We evaluated 21 patients, 12 (57%) males and 9 (43%) with familial DCM, including 3 (14%) with a family history of premature unexplained SCD. Mean age at DCM diagnosis was 40 ± 2 years, and mean age at ICD implantation was 50 ± 12 years. LVEF was 27 ± 9%, and LV end-diastolic diameter was 65 ± 7 mm. Genetic variants were found in six (29%) patients, occurring in 5 genes: <i>TPM1</i>, <i>TNNT2</i>, <i>MYH7</i>, <i>PLN</i>, and <i>MYBPC3</i>. The majority were classified as variants of uncertain significance. Family history of SCD was present in both patients with <i>PLN</i> variants.In patients with DCM and ICD, genetic variants could be identified in a significant proportion of patients in several genes, highlighting the potential role of genetics in DCM SCD risk stratification."	"The purpose of this overview is to increase clinician awareness of the genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the benefits of early diagnosis and management to individuals with genetic HCM. The goals of this overview are the following. GOAL 1: Define HCM. GOAL 2: Identify the categories of HCM. GOAL 3: Provide the evaluation strategy for a proband with HCM to establish (when possible) the specific genetic cause. GOAL 4: Provide a basic view of genetic risk assessment of at-risk asymptomatic relatives of a proband with HCM to inform cardiac surveillance and to allow early detection and treatment of HCM to improve long-term outcome."	"Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare cardiac disease, for which several genes including TNNT2, MYPN, FLNC and TNNI3 have been associated with its familial form.Here we describe a female proband with a severely manifested restrictive phenotype leading to heart transplantation at the age of 41, who was found homozygous for the novel TNNI3 mutation: NM_000363.4:c.586G &gt; C, p.(Asp196His). Her parents were third-degree cousins originating from a small village and although they were found heterozygous for the same variant they displayed no symptoms of the disease. Her older sister who was also found heterozygous was asymptomatic. Her twin sister and her brother who were homozygous for the same variant displayed a restrictive and a hypertrophic phenotype, respectively. Their children are all carriers of the mutation and remain asymptomatic until the age of 21.These observations point to a recessive mode of inheritance reported for the first time for this combination of gene/disease."	"Genetic testing for families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) provides a significant opportunity to improve care. Recent trends to increase gene panel sizes often mean variants in genes with questionable association are reported to patients. Classification of HCM genes and variants is critical, as misclassification can lead to genetic misdiagnosis. We show the validity of previously reported HCM genes using an established method for evaluating gene-disease associations.A systematic approach was used to assess the validity of reported gene-disease associations, including associations with isolated HCM and syndromes including left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes were categorized as having definitive, strong, moderate, limited, or no evidence of disease causation. We also reviewed current variant classifications for HCM in ClinVar, a publicly available variant resource.Fifty-seven genes were selected for curation based on their frequent inclusion in HCM testing and prior association reports. Of 33 HCM genes, only 8 (24%) were categorized as definitive ( MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, ACTC1, MYL2, and MYL3); 3 had moderate evidence ( CSRP3, TNNC1, and JPH2; 33%); and 22 (66%) had limited (n=16) or no evidence (n=6). There were 12 of 24 syndromic genes definitively associated with isolated left ventricular hypertrophy. Of 4191 HCM variants in ClinVar, 31% were in genes with limited or no evidence of disease association.The majority of genes previously reported as causative of HCM and commonly included in diagnostic tests have limited or no evidence of disease association. Systematically curated HCM genes are essential to guide appropriate reporting of variants and ensure the best possible outcomes for HCM families."	"Inflammatory response is an important determining factor for the mortality of patients with pulmonary thromboembolism. Inflammatory mediators can promote thrombus formation and increase hemodynamic instability. Urokinase is a commonly used drug for the treatment of PTE. The effect of urokinase on inflammatory reaction in PTE is still unclear. Our study was aimed at evaluating the effects of the intervention of urokinase and urokinase combined with aspirin in PTE rats. Results revealed that a large amount of infiltrated inflammatory cells surrounding the bronchus, vessels, and pulmonary mesenchyme, and even pulmonary abscess were observed in the PTE rats. CX3CL1/CX3CR1 coexpression, CX3CL1/NF-<i>κ</i>B coexpression, and TXA2 were significantly higher. After treatment with urokinase, pulmonary embolism was partially dissolved and inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly reduced. The expression of TNNI3, BNP, D2D, PASP, PADP, PAMP, and TXA2, as well as CX3CL1/CX3CR1 coexpression and CX3CL1/NF-<i>κ</i>B coexpression were significantly lowered. Aspirin showed no synergistic action. Therefore, these findings suggested the occurrence of inflammation during the process of PTE in rats. Urokinase treatment reduced the inflammatory response."	NA
"TNNT2"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"Background Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by pathogenic sarcomere gene variants. Individuals with a thin-filament variant present with milder hypertrophy than carriers of thick-filament variants, although prognosis is poorer. Herein, we defined if decreased energetic status of the heart is an early pathomechanism in <i>TNNT2</i> (troponin T gene) variant carriers. Methods and Results Fourteen individuals with <i>TNNT2</i> variants (genotype positive), without left ventricular hypertrophy (G+/LVH-; n=6) and with LVH (G+/LVH+; n=8) and 14 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent cardiac magnetic resonance and [<sup>11</sup>C]-acetate positron emission tomography imaging to assess LV myocardial oxygen consumption, contractile parameters and myocardial external efficiency. Cardiac efficiency was significantly reduced compared with controls in G+/LVH- and G+/LVH+. Lower myocardial external efficiency in G+/LVH- is explained by higher global and regional oxygen consumption compared with controls without changes in contractile parameters. Reduced myocardial external efficiency in G+/LVH+ is explained by the increase in LV mass and higher oxygen consumption. Septal oxygen consumption was significantly lower in G+/LVH+ compared with G+/LVH-. Although LV ejection fraction was higher in G+/LVH+, both systolic and diastolic strain parameters were lower compared with controls, which was most evident in the hypertrophied septal wall. Conclusions Using cardiac magnetic resonance and [<sup>11</sup>C]-acetate positron emission tomography imaging, we show that G+/LVH- have an initial increase in oxygen consumption preceding contractile dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy, followed by a decline in oxygen consumption in G+/LVH+. This suggests that high oxygen consumption and reduced myocardial external efficiency characterize the early gene variant-mediated disease mechanisms that may be used for early diagnosis and development of preventive treatments."	"Troponin (TNN)-encoded cardiac troponins (Tn) are critical for sensing calcium and triggering myofilament contraction. TNN variants are associated with development of cardiomyopathy; however, recent advances in genetic analysis have identified rare population variants. It is unclear how certain variants are associated with disease while others are tolerated.To compare probands with TNNT2, TNNI3, and TNNC1 variants and utilize high-resolution variant comparison mapping of pathologic and rare population variants to identify loci associated with disease pathogenesis.Cardiomyopathy-associated TNN variants were identified in the literature and topology mapping conducted. Clinical features were compiled and compared. Rare population variants were obtained from the gnomAD database. Signal-to-noise (S:N) normalized pathologic variant frequency against population variant frequency. Abstract review of clinical phenotypes was applied to &quot;significant&quot; hot spots.Probands were compiled (N = 70 studies, 224 probands) as were rare variants (N = 125,748 exomes; 15,708 genomes, MAF &lt;0.001). TNNC1-positive probands demonstrated the youngest age of presentation (20.0 years; P = .016 vs TNNT2; P = .004 vs TNNI3) and the highest death, transplant, or ventricular fibrillation events (P = .093 vs TNNT2; P = .024 vs TNNI3; Kaplan Meir: P = .025). S:N analysis yielded hot spots of diagnostic significance within the tropomyosin-binding domains, α-helix 1, and the N-Terminus in TNNT2 with increased sudden cardiac death and ventricular fibrillation (P = .004). The inhibitory region and C-terminal region in TNNI3 exhibited increased restrictive cardiomyopathy (P =.008). HCM and RCM models tended to have increased calcium sensitivity and DCM decreased sensitivity (P &lt; .001). DCM and HCM studies typically showed no differences in Hill coefficient which was decreased in RCM models (P &lt; .001). CM models typically demonstrated no changes to F<sub>max</sub> (P = .239).TNNC1-positive probands had younger ages of diagnosis and poorer clinical outcomes. Mapping of TNN variants identified locations in TNNT2 and TNNI3 associated with heightened pathogenicity, RCM diagnosis, and increased risk of sudden death."	"Proper cell-cycle progression is essential for the self-renewal and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI) has allowed the dual-color visualization of the G<sub>1</sub> and S/G<sub>2</sub> /M phases in various dynamic models, but its application in hPSCs is not widely reported. In addition, lineage-specific FUCCI reporters have not yet been developed to analyze complex tissue-specific cell-cycle progression during hPSC differentiation. Desiring a robust tool for spatiotemporal reporting of cell-cycle events in hPSCs, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and successfully knocked the FUCCI reporter into the AAVS1 safe harbor locus of hPSCs for stable and constitutive FUCCI expression, exhibiting reliable cell-cycle-dependent fluorescence in both hPSCs and their differentiated progeny. We also established a cardiac-specific TNNT2-FUCCI reporter for lineage-specific cell-cycle monitoring of cardiomyocyte differentiation from hPSCs. This powerful and modular FUCCI system should provide numerous opportunities for studying human cell-cycle activity, and enable the identification and investigation of novel regulators for adult tissue regeneration."	"Background Pediatric-onset restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is associated with high mortality, but underlying mechanisms of disease are under investigated. RCM-associated diastolic dysfunction secondary to variants in <i>TNNT2</i>-encoded cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) is poorly described. Methods and Results Genetic analysis of a proband and kindred with RCM identified TNNT2-R94C, which cosegregated in a family with 2 generations of RCM, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. TNNT2-R94C was absent among large, population-based cohorts Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and predicted to be pathologic by in silico modeling. Biophysical experiments using recombinant human TNNT2-R94C demonstrated impaired cardiac regulation at the molecular level attributed to reduced calcium-dependent blocking of myosin's interaction with the thin filament. Computational modeling predicted a shift in the force-calcium curve for the R94C mutant toward submaximal calcium activation compared within the wild type, suggesting low levels of muscle activation even at resting calcium concentrations and hypercontractility following activation by calcium. Conclusions The pathogenic TNNT2-R94C variant activates thin-filament-mediated sarcomeric contraction at submaximal calcium concentrations, likely resulting in increased muscle tension during diastole and hypercontractility during systole. This describes the proximal biophysical mechanism for development of RCM in this family."	"MicroRNAs (miRs) appear to be major, yet poorly understood players in regulatory networks guiding cardiogenesis. We sought to identify miRs with unknown functions during cardiogenesis analyzing the miR-profile of multipotent <i>Nkx2.5</i> enhancer cardiac progenitor cells (NkxCE-CPCs). Besides well-known candidates such as miR-1, we found about 40 miRs that were highly enriched in NkxCE-CPCs, four of which were chosen for further analysis. Knockdown in zebrafish revealed that only miR-128a affected cardiac development and function robustly. For a detailed analysis, loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were performed during in vitro differentiations of transgenic murine pluripotent stem cells. MiR-128a knockdown (1) increased <i>Isl1</i>, <i>Sfrp5</i>, and <i>Hcn4</i> (cardiac transcription factors) but reduced <i>Irx4</i> at the onset of cardiogenesis, (2) upregulated <i>Isl1</i>-positive CPCs, whereas NkxCE-positive CPCs were downregulated, and (3) increased the expression of the ventricular cardiomyocyte marker <i>Myl2</i> accompanied by a reduced beating frequency of early cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of miR-128a (4) diminished the expression of <i>Isl1</i>, <i>Sfrp5</i>, <i>Nkx2.5</i>, and <i>Mef2c</i>, but increased <i>Irx4</i>, (5) enhanced NkxCE-positive CPCs, and (6) favored nodal-like cardiomyocytes (<i>Tnnt2</i><sup>+</sup>, <i>Myh6</i><sup>+</sup>, <i>Shox2</i><sup>+</sup>) accompanied by increased beating frequencies. In summary, we demonstrated that miR-128a plays a so-far unknown role in early heart development by affecting the timing of CPC differentiation into various cardiomyocyte subtypes."	"The possibility of using stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes opens a new platform for modeling cardiac cell differentiation and disease or the development of new drugs. Progress in this field can be accelerated by high-throughput screening (HTS) technology combined with promoter reporter system. The goal of the study was to create and evaluate a responsive promoter reporter system that allows monitoring of iPSC differentiation towards cardiomyocytes. The lentiviral promoter reporter system was based on troponin 2 (TNNT2) and alpha cardiac actin (ACTC) with firefly luciferase and mCherry, respectively. The system was evaluated in two in vitro models. First, system followed the differentiation of TNNT2-luc-T2A-Puro-mCMV-GFP and hACTC-mcherry-WPRE-EF1-Neo from transduced iPSC line towards cardiomyocytes and revealed the significant decrease in both inserts copy number during the prolonged in vitro cell culture (confirmed by I-FISH, ddPCR, qPCR). Second, differentiated and contracting control cardiomyocytes (obtained from control non-reporter transduced iPSCs) were subsequently transduced with TNNT2-luc-T2A-Puro-CMV-GFP and hACTC-mcherry-WPRE-EF1-Neo lentiviruses to observe the functionality of obtained cardiomyocytes. Our results indicated that the reporter modified cell lines can be used for HTS applications, but it is essential to monitor the stability of the reporter sequence during extended cell in vitro culture."	"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is genetically heterogeneous, with &gt;100 purported disease genes tested in clinical laboratories. However, many genes were originally identified based on candidate-gene studies that did not adequately account for background population variation. Here we define the frequency of rare variation in 2538 patients with DCM across protein-coding regions of 56 commonly tested genes and compare this to both 912 confirmed healthy controls and a reference population of 60 706 individuals to identify clinically interpretable genes robustly associated with dominant monogenic DCM.We used the TruSight Cardio sequencing panel to evaluate the burden of rare variants in 56 putative DCM genes in 1040 patients with DCM and 912 healthy volunteers processed with identical sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines. We further aggregated data from 1498 patients with DCM sequenced in diagnostic laboratories and the Exome Aggregation Consortium database for replication and meta-analysis.Truncating variants in <i>TTN</i> and <i>DSP</i> were associated with DCM in all comparisons. Variants in <i>MYH7, LMNA, BAG3, TNNT2, TNNC1, PLN, ACTC1, NEXN, TPM1</i>, and <i>VCL</i> were significantly enriched in specific patient subsets, with the last 2 genes potentially contributing primarily to early-onset forms of DCM. Overall, rare variants in these 12 genes potentially explained 17% of cases in the outpatient clinic cohort representing a broad range of adult patients with DCM and 26% of cases in the diagnostic referral cohort enriched in familial and early-onset DCM. Although the absence of a significant excess in other genes cannot preclude a limited role in disease, such genes have limited diagnostic value because novel variants will be uninterpretable and their diagnostic yield is minimal.In the largest sequenced DCM cohort yet described, we observe robust disease association with 12 genes, highlighting their importance in DCM and translating into high interpretability in diagnostic testing. The other genes analyzed here will need to be rigorously evaluated in ongoing curation efforts to determine their validity as Mendelian DCM genes but have limited value in diagnostic testing in DCM at present. This data will contribute to community gene curation efforts and will reduce erroneous and inconclusive findings in diagnostic testing."	"Human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs) are a valuable, easily obtainable alternative source of SCs for regenerative medicine. Usually, amounts of cells required for the translational purposes are large thus the goal of this study was to assess the potency of AF-MSCs to proliferate and differentiate during long-term cultivation in vitro. AF-MSCs were isolated from amniotic fluid of healthy women in the second trimester of pregnancy and cultivated in vitro. AF-MSCs were cultivated up to 42 passages and they still maintained pluripotency genes, such as OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, expression at a similar level as in the initial passages as determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis demonstrated that the cell surface markers CD34 (negative), CD44, and CD105 (positive) expression was also stable, only the expression of SCs marker CD90 decreased during the cultivation. The morphology of AF-MSCs changed over passage, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining revealed that more cells entered into apoptosis and the first signs of aging were detected only at late passages (later than p33) using SA-β-gal assay. Concomitantly, the differentiation potential towards cardiomyogenic lineage, induced with DNA methyltransferases inhibitors decitabine, zebularine, and RG108, was impaired when comparing AF-MSCs at p31/33 with p6. The expression of cardiomyocytes genes MYH6, TNNT2, DES together with ion channels genes of the heart (sodium, calcium, and potassium) decreased in p31/33 induced AF-MSCs. AF-MSCs have a great proliferative capacity and maintain most of the characteristics up to 33 passages; however, the cardiomyogenic differentiation capacity decreases to a certain extent during the long-term cultivation. These results provide useful insights for the potential use of AF-MSCs for biobanking and broad applications requiring high yield of cells or repeated infusions. Hence, it is vital to take into account the passage number of AF-MSCs, cultivated in culture, when utilizing them in vivo or in clinical experiments."	"Chronic heart failure (CHF) seriously affects the quality of patients' lives. Sacrubitril/valsartan is a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, a new therapeutic drugs to treat CHF.This study aims to observe the impact of sacrubitril/valsartan on clinical treatment and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) serum levels, the improvement of the left atrial diameter (LAD) and left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD), and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with CHF.120 patients were randomly divided into a sacrubitil/valsartan group and a valsantan group, with 60 cases in each. Patients in the sacrubitil/valsartan group were administered sacrubitril/valsartan; while in the valsantan group, they were administered valsartan. The clinical effects, adverse reactions, and rehospitalization were observed eight weeks later, and hs-cTnT and NT-ProBNP serum levels and LAD, LVEDD, and LVEF were assayed.There were 53 cases of positive effect in the sacrubitil/valsartan group and 42 in the valsartan group (P &lt; 0.05). Eight participants demonstrated adverse reactions in the sacrubitil/valsartan group, while 17 in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Hs-cTnT and NT-ProBNP serum levels, the measurements of LAD, LVEDD, and LVEF in the sacrubitil/valsartan group before the treatments were (24.47 ± 7.54) pg/mL, (10,356.94 ± 5,447.68) pg/mL, (49.41 ± 5.22) mm, (68.06 ± 6.20) mm and (31.12 ±6.65) %; in the valsartan group were (29.752 ± 10.03) pg/mL, (9,518.17 ± 5,905.17) pg/mL, (49.65 ± 4.91) mm, (67.06 ± 3.97) mm, and (30.41 ± 6.11) % (P &gt; 0.05), while in the sacrubitil/valsartan group, the values decreased after the treatments to (17.92 ± 4.74) pg/mL, (3,881.59 ± 2,087.79) pg/mL, (42.18 ± 4.87) mm, (60.35 ± 7.12) mm and (45.35 ± 4.49) %; in the valsartan group to (25.81 ± 7.36) pg/mL, (6,278.35 ± 2,643.11) pg/mL, (46.53 ± 4.80) mm, (64.51 ± 4.34) mm, and (36.47 ± 5.21) % (P &lt; 0.05). There were significant differences within the same group, before and after treatments (P &lt; 0.05).Sacrubitril/valsartan treatment of patients with CHF improves their symptoms and is deserving of clinical application. This is also evident from significantly improved levels of serum hs-cTnT and NT-ProBNP and the left ventricular function."	"Clinical trials using human adipogenic mesenchymal stem cells (hAdMSCs) for the treatment of cardiac diseases have shown improvement in cardiac function and were proven safe. However, hAdMSCs do not convert efficiently into cardiomyocytes (CMs) or vasculature. Thus, reprogramming hAdMSCs into myocyte progenitors may fare better in future investigations. To reprogramme hAdMSCs into electrically conductive cardiac progenitor cells, we pioneered a three-step reprogramming strategy that uses proven MESP1/ETS2 transcription factors, β-adrenergic and hypoxic signalling induced in three-dimensional (3D) cardiospheres. In Stage 1, ETS2 and MESP1 activated NNKX2.5, TBX5, MEF2C, dHAND, and GATA4 during the conversion of hAdMSCs into cardiac progenitor cells. Next, in Stage 2, β2AR activation repositioned cardiac progenitors into de novo immature conductive cardiac cells, along with the appearance of RYR2, CAV2.1, CAV3.1, NAV1.5, SERCA2, and CX45 gene transcripts and displayed action potentials. In Stage 3, electrical conduction that was fostered by 3D cardiospheres formed in a Synthecon®, Inc. rotating bioreactor induced the appearance of hypoxic genes: HIF-1α/β, PCG 1α/β, and NOS2, which coincided with the robust activation of adult contractile genes including MLC2v, TNNT2, and TNNI3, ion channel genes, and the appearance of hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN1-4). Conduction velocities doubled to ~200 mm/s after hypoxia and doubled yet again after dissociation of the 3D cell clusters to ~400 mm/s. By comparison, normal conduction velocities within working ventricular myocytes in the whole heart range from 0.5 to 1 m/s. Epinephrine stimulation of stage 3 cardiac cells in patches resulted in an increase in amplitude of the electrical wave, indicative of conductive cardiac cells. Our efficient protocol that converted hAdMSCs into highly conductive cardiac progenitors demonstrated the potential utilization of stage 3 cells for tissue engineering applications for cardiac repair."	"Cardiac muscle troponin T (Tnnt2) mediates muscle contraction in response to calcium ion dynamics, and <i>Tnnt2</i> mutations are associated with multiple types of cardiomyopathy. Here, we employed a zebrafish model to investigate the genetic replenishment strategies of using conditional and inducible promoters to rescue the deficiencies in the heart. <i>tnnt2a</i> mutations were induced in zebrafish via the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, and the mutants displayed heart arrest and dilated cardiomyopathy-like phenotypes. We first utilized the classic myocardial promoter of the <i>myl7</i> and <i>TetOn</i> inducible system to restore <i>tnnt2a</i> expression in myocardial tissue in <i>tnnt2a</i> mutant zebrafish. However, this attempt failed to recover normal heart function and circulation, although heart pumping was partially restored. Further analyses via both RNA-seq and immunofluorescence indicated that Tnnt2a, which was also expressed in a novel group of <i>myl7</i>-negative smooth muscle cells on the outflow tract (OFT), was indispensably responsible for the normal mechanical dynamics of OFT. Lastly, <i>tnnt2</i> expression induced by OFT cells in addition to the myocardial cells successfully rescued heart function and circulation in <i>tnnt2a</i> mutant zebrafish. Together, our results reveal the significance of OFT expression of Tnnt2 for cardiac function and demonstrate zebrafish larva as a powerful and convenient <i>in vivo</i> platform for studying cardiomyopathy and the relevant therapeutic strategies."	"Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a frequent finding during echocardiography screening in fetal or neonatal life, which reveals a weak association between TR and cardiac malformation. Except for structural abnormalities, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) ranks as the top reason for early child morbidity and mortality among all kinds of cardiomyopathy. In the early fetal stage, cardiac abnormalities detected by early fetal genetic testing followed by abnormalities on ultrasound would provide more valuable information for parents and physicians to make a better therapeutic schedule.A case of severe TR was found via the fetal ultrasound screening. After birth, this child suffered severe heart dysfunction, and echocardiography confirmed a DCM phenotype within a very short time.A 40-year-old female received routine fetal echocardiographic screening, which demonstrated that the fetus presented severe TR. Six months after birth, the baby experienced severe heart failure, as the EF dropped to 22% with an extremely large LV chamber. The genomic sequence had been determined, and 3 pathogenic gene mutations located in 2 genes, cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) c.548G&gt;A, desmoplakin (DSP) c.3146C&gt;T, and DSP c.5213G&gt;A, were identified. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with DCM. This child received digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone diuresis, captopril, and L-carnitine, and the symptoms of heart failure had been controlled as the patient waited for heart transplantation.During the follow-up, the patient still suffered from poor heart function and an enlarged left ventricle. Concomitantly, the parents placed her on a waiting list for heart transplantation.Fetal TR is a common phenomenon, and many studies have indicated that isolated TR is not an appropriate predictor of chromosomal abnormalities or congenital heart defects. However, according to this case, it is urgent to recommend that the mother should take advantage of free fetal DNA analysis in a maternal blood sample to obtain further molecular evidence once fetal echocardiography reveals moderate to severe TR with any maternal high-risk factors for birth defects."	"Symptom of ventricular hypertrophy caused by cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) mutations is mild, while patients often showed high incidence of sudden cardiac death. The 92nd arginine to glutamine mutation (R92Q) of cTnT was one of the mutant hotspots in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there are no such human disease models yet. To solve this problem, we generated TNNT2 R92Q mutant hESC cell lines (heterozygote or homozygote) using TALEN mediated homologous recombination in this study. After directed cardiac differentiation, we found a relative larger cell size in both heterozygous and homozygous TNNT2 R92Q hESC-cardiomyocytes. Expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase2a (SERCA2a) were downregulated, while myocyte specific enhancer factor 2c (MEF2c) and the ratio of beta myosin to alpha myosin heavy chain (MYH7/MYH6) were increased in heterozygous TNNT2 R92Q hESC-cardiomyocytes. TNNT2 R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes exhibited efficient responses to heart-related pharmaceutical agents. We also found TNNT2 R92Q heterozygous mutant cardiomyocytes showed increased calcium sensitivity and contractility. Further, engineered heart tissues (EHTs) prepared by combining rat decellularized heart extracellular matrices with heterozygous R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes showed similar drug responses as to HCM patients and increased sensitivity to caspofungin-induced cardiotoxicity. Using RNA-sequencing of TNNT2 R92Q heterozygous mutant cardiomyocytes, we found dysregulation of calcium might participated in the early development of hypertrophy. Our hESC-derived TNNT2 R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes and EHTs are good in vitro human disease models for future disease studies and drug screening."	"Our previous studies have shown that Pygo (Pygopus) in Drosophila plays a critical role in adult heart function that is likely conserved in mammals. However, its role in the differentiation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) into cardiomyocytes remains unknown.To investigate the role of pygo2 in the differentiation of hUC-MSCs into cardiomyocytes.Third passage hUC-MSCs were divided into two groups: a p+ group infected with the GV492-pygo2 virus and a p- group infected with the GV492 virus. After infection and 3 or 21 days of incubation, Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect pluripotency markers, including OCT-4 and SOX2. Nkx2.5, Gata-4 and cTnT were detected by immunofluorescence at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection, respectively. Expression of cardiac-related genes-including Nkx2.5, Gata-4, TNNT2, MEF2c, ISL-1, FOXH1, KDR, αMHC and α-Actin-were analyzed by qRT-PCR following transfection with the virus at one, two and three weeks.After three days of incubation, there were no significant changes in the expression of the pluripotency stem cell markers OCT-4 and SOX2 in the p+ group hUC-MSCs relative to controls (OCT-4: 1.03 ± 0.096 VS 1, P &gt; 0.05, SOX2: 1.071 ± 0.189 VS 1, P &gt; 0.05); however, after 21 days, significant decreases were observed (OCT-4: 0.164 ± 0.098 VS 1, P &lt; 0.01, SOX2: 0.209 ± 0.109 VS 1, P &lt; 0.001). Seven days following incubation, expression of mesoderm specialisation markers, such as Nkx2.5, Gata-4, MEF2c and KDR, were increased; at 14 days following incubation, expression of cardiac genes, such as Nkx2.5, Gata-4, TNNT2, MEF2c, ISL-1, FOXH1, KDR, αMHC and α-Actin, were significantly upregulated in the p+ group relative to the p- group (P &lt; 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that overexpression of pygo2 results in more hUCMSCs gradually differentiating into cardiomyocyte-like cells.We are the first to show that overexpression of pygo2 significantly enhances the expression of cardiac-genic genes, including Nkx2.5 and Gata-4, and promotes the differentiation of hUC-MSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells."	"Preserving mitochondrial activity is crucial in rescuing cardiac function following acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The sex difference in myocardial functional recovery has been observed after I/R. Given the key role of mitochondrial connexin43 (Cx43) in cardiac protection initiated by ischemic preconditioning, we aimed to determine the implication of mitochondrial Cx43 in sex-related myocardial responses and to examine the effect of estrogen (17β-estradiol, E2) on Cx43, particularly mitochondrial Cx43-involved cardiac protection following I/R. Mouse primary cardiomyocytes and isolated mouse hearts (from males, females, ovariectomized females, and doxycycline-inducible Tnnt2-controlled Cx43 knockout without or with acute post-ischemic E2 treatment) were subjected to simulated I/R in culture or Langendorff I/R (25-min warm ischemia/40-min reperfusion), respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial superoxide production were measured in cardiomyocytes. Myocardial function and infarct size were determined. Cx43 and its isoform, Gja1-20k, were assessed in mitochondria. Immunoelectron microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation were also used to examine mitochondrial Cx43 and its interaction with estrogen receptor-α by E2 in mitochondria, respectively. There were sex disparities in stress-induced cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function. E2 partially restored mitochondrial activity in cardiomyocytes following acute injury. Post-ischemia infusion of E2 improved functional recovery and reduced infarct size with increased Cx43 content and phosphorylation in mitochondria. Ablation of cardiac Cx43 aggravated mitochondrial damage and abolished E2-mediated cardiac protection during I/R. Female mice were more resistant to myocardial I/R than age-matched males with greater protective role of mitochondrial Cx43 in female hearts. Post-ischemic E2 usage augmented mitochondrial Cx43 content and phosphorylation, increased mitochondrial Gja1-20k, and showed cardiac protection."	"Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are promising candidates to treat myocardial infarction and other cardiac diseases. Such treatments require pure cardiomyocytes (CMs) in large quantities. <b>Methods</b>: In the present study we describe an improved protocol for production of hiPSC-CMs in which hiPSCs are first converted into mesodermal cells by stimulation of wingless (Wnt) signaling using CHIR99021, which are then further differentiated into CM progenitors by simultaneous inhibition of porcupine and tankyrase pathways using IWP2 and XAV939 under continuous supplementation of ascorbate during the entire differentiation procedure. <b>Results</b>: The protocol resulted in reproducible generation of &gt;90% cardiac troponin T (TNNT2)-positive cells containing highly organized sarcomeres. In 2D monolayer cultures CM yields amounted to 0.5 million cells per cm<sup>2</sup> growth area, and on average 72 million cells per 100 mL bioreactor suspension culture without continuous perfusion. The differentiation efficiency was hardly affected by the initial seeding density of undifferentiated hiPSCs. Furthermore, batch-to-batch variations were reduced by combinatorial use of ascorbate, IWP2, and XAV939. <b>Conclusion</b>: Combined inhibition of porcupine and tankyrase sub-pathways of Wnt signaling and continuous ascorbate supplementation, enable robust and efficient production of hiPSC-CMs."	"Cardiac involvement is one of the most important manifestations of the multisystemic phenotype of patients affected by myotonic dystrophy (DM) and represents the second cause of premature death. Molecular mechanisms responsible for DM cardiac defects are still unclear; however, missplicing of the cardiac isoform of troponin T (<i>TNNT2</i>) and of the cardiac sodium channel (<i>SCN5A</i>) genes might contribute to the reduced myocardial function and conduction abnormalities seen in DM patients. Since, in DM skeletal muscle, the <i>TNNT2</i> gene shows the same aberrant splicing pattern observed in cardiac muscle, the principal aim of this work was to verify if the <i>TNNT2</i> aberrant fetal isoform expression could be secondary to myopathic changes or could reflect the DM cardiac phenotype. Analysis of alternative splicing of <i>TNNT2</i> and of several genes involved in DM pathology has been performed on muscle biopsies from patients affected by DM type 1 (DM1) or type 2 (DM2) with or without cardiac involvement. Our analysis shows that missplicing of muscle-specific genes is higher in DM1 and DM2 than in regenerating control muscles, indicating that these missplicing could be effectively important in DM skeletal muscle pathology. When considering the <i>TNNT2</i> gene, missplicing appears to be more evident in DM1 than in DM2 muscles since, in DM2, the <i>TNNT2</i> fetal isoform appears to be less expressed than the adult isoform. This evidence does not seem to be related to less severe muscle histopathological alterations that appear to be similar in DM1 and DM2 muscles. These results seem to indicate that the more severe <i>TNNT2</i> missplicing observed in DM1 could not be related only to myopathic changes but could reflect the more severe general phenotype compared to DM2, including cardiac problems that appear to be more severe and frequent in DM1 than in DM2 patients. Moreover, <i>TNNT2</i> missplicing significantly correlates with the QRS cardiac parameter in DM1 but not in DM2 patients, indicating that this splicing event has good potential to function as a biomarker of DM1 severity and it should be considered in pharmacological clinical trials to monitor the possible effects of different therapeutic approaches on skeletal muscle tissues."	"Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in the adult mammalian heart, as well as exogenous CPCs injected at the border zone of infarcted tissue, display very low differentiation rate into cardiac myocytes and marginal repair capacity in the injured heart. Emerging evidence supports an obligatory metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during stem cells differentiation, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of metabolism may improve CPC differentiation and, potentially, healing properties. In this study, we investigated the metabolic transition underlying CPC differentiation toward cardiac myocytes. In addition, we tested whether activators of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), known to promote mitochondrial biogenesis in other cell types would also improve CPC differentiation. Stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1<sup>+</sup>) CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts and their phenotype compared with more mature neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs). Under normoxia, glucose consumption and lactate release were significantly higher in CPCs than in NRCMs. Both parameters were increased in hypoxia together with increased abundance of Glut1 (glucose transporter), of the monocarboxylic transporter Mct4 (lactate efflux mediator) and of Pfkfb3 (key regulator of glycolytic rate). CPC proliferation was critically dependent on glucose and glutamine availability in the media. Oxygen consumption analysis indicates that, compared with NRCMs, CPCs exhibited lower basal and maximal respirations with lower Tomm20 protein expression and mitochondrial DNA content. This CPC metabolic phenotype profoundly changed upon in vitro differentiation, with a decrease of glucose consumption and lactate release together with increased abundance of Tnnt2, Pgc-1α, Tomm20, and mitochondrial DNA content. Proliferative CPCs express both alpha1 and -2 catalytic subunits of AMPK that is activated by A769662. However, A769662 or resveratrol (an activator of Pgc-1α and AMPK) did not promote either mitochondrial biogenesis or CPC maturation during their differentiation. We conclude that although CPC differentiation is accompanied with an increase of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, this is not potentiated by activation of AMPK in these cells."	"Selenium deficiency has been proven to induce calcium disorders in the chicken heart. However, detailed regulatory mechanisms, e.g., the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA regulatory axis, have not yet been described. Here, we point out lnc-2315, miR-1594, and Troponin T (TNNT2) based on the results of lncRNA and miRNA comparative genomics group analysis of Se-deficient chicken hearts compared with control hearts. We employed lnc-3215 and TNNT2 knockdown, miR-1594 knockdown, and overexpression models in the chicken embryos in vivo, and lnc-3215, miR-1594, and TNNT2 knockdown and overexpression models in cardiomyocytes in vitro. The dual-luciferase reporter assay and quantitative real-time PCR were used to confirm the relationships between miR-1594 and TNNT2, lnc-3215, and miR-1594 in cardiomyocytes. Our results revealed that TNNT2 suppression induced cardiac calcium overload in vivo and in vitro. miR-1594 activates cardiac calcium overload by targeting TNNT2. Moreover, we found that lnc-3215 regulates miR-1594, and thus influences the TNNT2 expression in vivo and in vitro; these conclusions were verified by gene knockdown in chicken embryos. Our present study revealed a novel regulatory model of a calcium program, which comprises lnc-3215, miR-1594, and TNNT2 in the chicken heart. Our conclusions may provide a feasible diagnostic tool for Se-deficient cardiomyocytes injury."	NA
"TPM1"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"Beta tropomyosin (Tpm2) is demonstrated for the first time at the protein level in a fish species, using a combination of electrophoresis, mass spectrometric peptide mapping and end-group analysis. Tpm2 accounts for 50% of the total tropomyosin in slow trunk muscle of the adult Atlantic salmon as determined by quantitative carboxypeptidase digestion and is also present in the head and pectoral fin. It is absent in the fast skeletal (lighter-toned) trunk muscle, the most abundant muscle, which is composed solely of an alpha-fast (Tpm1) isoform. In contrast to the mammalian homologues, salmon Tpm2 migrates faster than salmon Tpm1 in the presence of anionic detergent. Other distinguishing characteristics are a reduced content of cysteine (one per chain) and tyrosine (five per chain) and a unique carboxyl-terminal region (residues 276-284). Two isoforms (paralogs) of alpha-slow tropomyosin (Tpm3) having different contents of methionine and histidine exist in slow trunk muscle indicating duplication of the TPM3 gene. Minor skeletal muscles, surveyed for the first time, contain a mix of at least two tropomyosins - Tpm2 (~ 50% of total) in pectoral fin, jaw and tongue and another isoform, either Tpm1 (pectoral fin) or alpha-1-like Tpm (jaw and tongue). Cheek muscle contains Tpm1 and alpha 1-like Tpm in varying proportion depending upon the section (light or dark). Of the two tropomyosins in tongue, Tpm2 displays comparatively weaker affinity for troponin-Sepharose. A feature of the major sarcomeric tropomyosins in Atlantic salmon is a pair of neighbouring glycines situated between residues 20-90."	"Tropomyosin alpha-1 chain (TPM1) is a member of the tropomyosin family and the expression of TPM1 is found to be dysregulated in various tumors. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical performance and significance of TPM1 in gastric cancer.First, the levels of TPM1 mRNA and protein were detected through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively. The correlation between TPM1 expression and clinicopathological variables was analyzed. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to determine the diagnostic performance of TPM1 in gastric cancer. Finally, overall survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier method in order to determine the prognostic performance of TPM1 in gastric cancer.Compared with the controls, TPM1 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly downregulated in patients with gastric cancer. Downregulation of TPM1 was associated with depth of invasion and tumor node metastasis (TNM; p = 0.0030 and 0.0175, respectively). Furthermore, TPM1 might be a novel predictive biomarker for gastric cancer with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.8327. Overall survival analysis indicated that low TPM1 expression predicted poor survival (log-rank test, p = 0.0058).TPM1 might be a novel predictive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer (95% con-fidence interval = 0.7705 - 0.8949, p &lt; 0.0001)."	"Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a hereditary cardiomyopathy that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Recently, LVNC was classified into several phenotypes including congenital heart disease (CHD). However, although LVNC and CHD are frequently observed, the role and clinical significance of genetics in these cardiomyopathies has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact on the perioperative outcomes of children with concomitant LVNC and CHD using next-generation sequencing (NGS).From May 2000 to August 2018, 53 Japanese probands with LVNC (25 males and 28 females) were enrolled and we screened 182 cardiomyopathy-associated genes in these patients using NGS.The age at diagnosis of the enrolled patients ranged from 0 to 14 years (median: 0.3 months). A total of 23 patients (43.4%) were diagnosed with heart failure, 14 with heart murmur (26.4%), and 6 with cyanosis (11.3%). During the observation period, 31 patients (58.5%) experienced heart failure and 13 (24.5%) developed arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and atrioventricular block. Moreover, 29 patients (54.7%) had ventricular septal defects (VSDs), 17 (32.1%) had atrial septal defects, 10 had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and 7 (13.2%) had Ebstein's anomaly and double outlet right ventricle. Among the included patients, 30 underwent surgery, 19 underwent biventricular repair, and 2 underwent pulmonary artery banding, bilateral pulmonary artery banding, and PDA ligation. Overall, 30 genetic variants were identified in 28 patients with LVNC and CHD. Eight variants were detected in <i>MYH7</i> and two in <i>TPM1.</i> Echocardiography showed lower ejection fractions and more thickened trabeculations in the left ventricle in patients with LVNC and CHD than in age-matched patients with VSDs. During follow-up, 4 patients died and the condition of 8 worsened postoperatively. The multivariable proportional hazards model showed that heart failure, LV ejection fraction of &lt; 24%, LV end-diastolic diameter z-score of &gt; 8.56, and noncompacted-to-compacted ratio of the left ventricular apex of &gt; 8.33 at the last visit were risk factors for survival.LVNC and CHD are frequently associated with genetic abnormalities. Knowledge of the association between CHD and LVNC is important for the awareness of clinical implications during the preoperative and postoperative periods to identify the populations who are at an increased risk of additional morbidity."	"Natural autoantibodies have been implicated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD) because they augment autoimmune activation. The aim of this study was to identify novel specific autoantibodies of CHD, and analyze the relationship between their levels and CHD risk indicators.First, clinical data and sera from CHD patients were collected. Then, one protein microarray containing 37 proteins that represent candidate autoantigens was developed. The arrays were used to profile autoantibodies in randomly selected sera from 35 samples (20 CHD patients, and 15 healthy controls). After that, microarray data were analyzed and autoantibodies for CHD were screened out. Then, ELISA detection was conducted to validate the differentiable autoantibodies using larger numbers of serum samples (131 CHD patients, and 131 healthy controls). Finally, the associations of antibodies with CHD risk indicator parameters were assessed. Inter-group comparison by microarray indicated that three CHD novel autoantibodies, including glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI), alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like (HnRNPDL), were significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) increased when compared with the healthy controls. Moreover, a significant increase of IgG autoantibodies for these three autoantigens was confirmed in CHD patients by ELISA (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). The correction analysis revealed a negative correlation of anti-TPM1 antibody levels and total cholesterol (<i>P</i> = 0.0034), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<i>P</i> = 0.0086), respectively.G6PI, TPM1, and HnRNPDL were CHD natural autoantigens, and serum anti-TPM1 antibody could be used as a potential marker to predict the risk for CHD patients."	"Heat stress is one of the major limitations to crop productivity. In the present study, an efficient method of screening was adopted for identification of heat tolerant Indian Mustard genotypes by applying 4-day cycle of heat stress to seedlings. Thirty-four genotypes were screened based upon lipid peroxidation and survival percentage and classified them into five different classes according to membership function value (MFV) for response against high temperature. The maximum and minimum value of mean MFV were 0.89 (highly heat tolerant, TPM1) and 0.12 (highly heat sensitive, JM2), respectively. The coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) between the mean MFV and the heat tolerance index (HTI) of MDA content, survival percentage was 0.914 and 0.808 suggesting that these parameters are reliable traits to evaluate the heat tolerance of <i>Brassica juncea</i> genotypes. The evaluation method was further validated using identified contrasting genotypes and assessment of heat stress associated biochemical parameters. Results showed efficient recovery of tolerant genotype as compared to sensitive genotype. Expression profiling of heat stress-related genes (<i>HSP21</i> and <i>HSFA7A</i>) showed significant upregulation in the tolerant genotype (TPM1) (9.73- and 4.87-fold, respectively) as compared to the sensitive genotype (JM2) (4.18- and 1.73-fold, respectively) under heat stress condition. The results imply development of an efficient screening method which is useful for evaluation and breeding of thermo-tolerant <i>B. juncea</i>."	" Modeling human cardiac diseases with induced pluripotent stem cells not only enables to study disease pathophysiology and develop therapies but also, as we have previously showed, it can offer a tool for disease diagnostics. We previously observed that a few genetic cardiac diseases can be separated from each other and healthy controls by applying machine learning to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient signals measured from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs). For the current research, 419 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) transient signals and 228 long QT syndrome (LQTS) transient signals were measured. HCM signals included data recorded from iPSC-CMs carrying either α-tropomyosin, i.e., TPM1 (HCMT) or MYBPC3 or myosin-binding protein C (HCMM) mutation and LQTS signals included data recorded from iPSC-CMs carrying potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 (KCNQ1) mutation (long QT syndrome 1 [LQT1]) or KCNH2 mutation (long QT syndrome 2 [LQT2]). The main objective was to study whether and how effectively HCMM and HCMT can be separated from each other as well as LQT1 from LQT2. After preprocessing those Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals where we computed peak waveforms we then classified the two mutations of both disease pairs by using several different machine learning methods. We obtained excellent classification accuracies of 89% for HCM and even 100% for LQT at their best. The results indicate that the methods applied would be efficient for the identification of these genetic cardiac diseases."	"The vast majority of cardiomyopathies have an autosomal dominant inheritance; hence, genetic testing is typically offered to patients with a positive family history. A de novo mutation is a new germline mutation not inherited from either parent. The purpose of our study was to search for de novo mutations in patients with cardiomyopathy and no evidence of the disease in the family. Using next-generation sequencing, we analyzed cardiomyopathy genes in 12 probands. In 8 (66.7%), we found de novo variants in known cardiomyopathy genes (<i>TTN</i>, <i>DSP</i>, <i>SCN5A</i>, <i>TNNC1</i>, <i>TPM1</i>, <i>CRYAB</i>, <i>MYH7</i>). In the remaining probands, the analysis was extended to whole exome sequencing in a trio (proband and parents). We found de novo variants in genes that, so far, were not associated with any disease (<i>TRIB3</i>, <i>SLC2A6</i>), a possible disease-causing biallelic genotype (<i>APOBEC</i> gene family), and a de novo mosaic variant without strong evidence of pathogenicity (<i>UNC45A</i>). The high prevalence of de novo mutations emphasizes that genetic screening is also indicated in cases of sporadic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, we have identified novel cardiomyopathy candidate genes that are likely to affect immunological function and/or reaction to stress that could be especially relevant in patients with disease onset associated with infection/infestation."	"Tropomyosin and cofilin are involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamic polymerization and depolymerization. Binding of cofilin changes actin filaments structure, leading to their severing and depolymerization. Non-muscle tropomyosin isoforms were shown before to differentially regulate the activity of cofilin 1; products of TPM1 gene stabilized actin filaments, but products of TPM3 gene promoted cofilin-dependent severing and depolymerization. Here, conformational changes at the longitudinal and lateral interface between actin subunits resulting from tropomyosin and cofilin 1 binding were studied using skeletal actin and yeast wild type and mutant Q41C and S265C actins. Cross-linking of F-actin and fluorescence changes in F-actin labeled with acrylodan at Cys41 (in D-loop) or Cys265 (in H-loop) showed that tropomyosin isoforms differentially regulated cofilin-induced conformational rearrangements at longitudinal and lateral filament interfaces. Tryptic digestion of F-Mg-actin confirmed the differences between tropomyosin isoforms in their regulation of cofilin-dependent changes at actin-actin interfaces. Changes in the fluorescence of AEDANS attached to C-terminal Cys of actin, as well as FRET between Trp residues in actin subdomain 1 and AEDANS, did not show differences in the conformation of the C-terminal segment of F-actin in the presence of different tropomyosins ± cofilin 1. Therefore, actin's D- and H-loop are the sites involved in regulation of cofilin activity by tropomyosin isoforms."	"Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most common malignancies and has a relatively poor outcome worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms and processes of BCa development and progression remain poorly understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify candidate genes in the carcinogenesis and progression of BCa. Five GEO datasets and TCGA-BLCA datasets were analyzed by statistical software R, FUNRICH, Cytoscape, and online instruments to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), to construct protein‒protein interaction networks (PPIs) and perform functional enrichment analysis and survival analyses. In total, we found 418 DEGs. We found 14 hub genes, and gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed DEG enrichment in networks and pathways related to cell cycle and proliferation, but also in cell movement, receptor signaling, and viral carcinogenesis. Compared with noncancerous tissues, TPM1, CRYAB, and CASQ2 were significantly downregulated in BCa, and the other hub genes were significant upregulated. Furthermore, MAD2L1 and CASQ2 potentially play a pivotal role in lymph nodal metastasis. CRYAB and CASQ2 were both significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The present study highlights an up to now unrecognized possible role of CASQ2 in cancer (BCa). Furthermore, CRYAB has never been described in BCa, but our study suggests that it may also be a candidate biomarker in BCa."	"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is genetically heterogeneous, with &gt;100 purported disease genes tested in clinical laboratories. However, many genes were originally identified based on candidate-gene studies that did not adequately account for background population variation. Here we define the frequency of rare variation in 2538 patients with DCM across protein-coding regions of 56 commonly tested genes and compare this to both 912 confirmed healthy controls and a reference population of 60 706 individuals to identify clinically interpretable genes robustly associated with dominant monogenic DCM.We used the TruSight Cardio sequencing panel to evaluate the burden of rare variants in 56 putative DCM genes in 1040 patients with DCM and 912 healthy volunteers processed with identical sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines. We further aggregated data from 1498 patients with DCM sequenced in diagnostic laboratories and the Exome Aggregation Consortium database for replication and meta-analysis.Truncating variants in <i>TTN</i> and <i>DSP</i> were associated with DCM in all comparisons. Variants in <i>MYH7, LMNA, BAG3, TNNT2, TNNC1, PLN, ACTC1, NEXN, TPM1</i>, and <i>VCL</i> were significantly enriched in specific patient subsets, with the last 2 genes potentially contributing primarily to early-onset forms of DCM. Overall, rare variants in these 12 genes potentially explained 17% of cases in the outpatient clinic cohort representing a broad range of adult patients with DCM and 26% of cases in the diagnostic referral cohort enriched in familial and early-onset DCM. Although the absence of a significant excess in other genes cannot preclude a limited role in disease, such genes have limited diagnostic value because novel variants will be uninterpretable and their diagnostic yield is minimal.In the largest sequenced DCM cohort yet described, we observe robust disease association with 12 genes, highlighting their importance in DCM and translating into high interpretability in diagnostic testing. The other genes analyzed here will need to be rigorously evaluated in ongoing curation efforts to determine their validity as Mendelian DCM genes but have limited value in diagnostic testing in DCM at present. This data will contribute to community gene curation efforts and will reduce erroneous and inconclusive findings in diagnostic testing."	"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate differential genes (DEGs) between no/mild and severe emphysema by bioinformatics analysis. <b>Methods:</b> The microarray dataset GSE1650, of lung tissue in no/mild and severe emphysema, was downloaded from the GEO database, and DEGs were obtained by <i>t</i> test. Analysis of DEGs based on DAVID database was used to obtain gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway. The protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was established using STRING database to identify hub genes. <b>Results:</b> A total of 76 DEGs were obtained, of which 62 genes were up-regulated and 14 genes were down-regulated in severe emphysema group. Gene ontology showed that the DEGs were mainly involved in neutrophil chemotaxis, cellular response to interleukin-1, extracellular matrix organization, immune response, and KEGG pathway involved cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, platelet activation. Seventeen hub genes were recognized by PPI analysis, including CXCL8, RRAD, CLU, TIMP1, SEPP1, ISLR, BGN, COL1A1, COLIA2, ACTA2, ACTN1, FIGF, TPM1, TPM2, LUM, COL6A3 and TAGLN. Among them, fifteen genes (CLU, TIMP1, SEPP1, ISLR, BGN, COLIA2, COL1A1, ACTA2, ACTN1, FIGF, TPM1, TPM2, LUM, COL6A3, TAGLN) were up-regulated and two genes (CXCL8, RRAD) were down-regulated. <b>Conclusion:</b> Bioinformatics analysis based on GEO database showed that there were DEGs between non/mild and severe emphysema patients."	"Formins and tropomyosins (Tpms) are two central components of the microfilaments. Formins are involved in the nucleation and polymerization of actin filaments, and Tpms form along the actin stress fibers to regulate their dynamics. However, the correlation between formins and Tpms remains unclear. Here, we elucidated the function of distinct formins and their specific regulation to the subcellular-localization of Tpm isoforms on dorsal stress fibers in human osteosarcoma cells. Knockdown of individual formin isoform led to varied defects in actin stress fiber network, but did not affect the expression level of other formin isoforms and Tpms. Further investigation showed that different formins regulated distinct Tpm isoforms in decorating dorsal stress fibers. Specifically, DAAM1 and FHOD1 restricted the distal end expression of Tpm3.1; INF2 controlled the approximate localization of Tpm4.2; and Dia1 partially modulated the dorsal localization of Tpm1.6. Taken together, these data provide microscopy experimental evidence that different formins restrict the localization of distinct Tpm isoforms on dorsal actin stress fibers."	"Heart failure (HF) may arise from alterations in metabolic, structural, and signaling pathways, but its genetic architecture is incompletely understood. To elucidate potential genetic contributors to cardiac remodeling and HF, we integrated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, gene expression, and DNA methylation using a transomics analytical approach.We used robust rank aggregation (where the position of a certain gene in a rank order list [based on statistical significance level] is tested against a randomly shuffled rank order list) to derive an integrative transomic score for each annotated gene associated with a HF trait.We evaluated ≤8372 FHS (Framingham Heart Study) participants (54% women; mean age, 55±17 years). Of these, 62 (0.7%) and 35 (0.4%) had prevalent HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively. During a mean follow-up of 8.5 years (minimum-maximum, 0.005-18.6 years), 223 (2.7%) and 234 (2.8%) individuals developed incident HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction, respectively. Top genes included <i>MMP20</i> and <i>MTSS1</i> (promotes actin assembly at intercellular junctions) for left ventricular systolic function; <i>ITGA9</i> (receptor for <i>VCAM1</i> [vascular cell protein 1]) and <i>C5</i> for left ventricular remodeling; <i>NUP210</i> (expressed during myogenic differentiation) and <i>ANK1</i> (cytoskeletal protein) for diastolic function; <i>TSPAN16</i> and <i>RAB11FIP3</i> (involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton) for prevalent HF with reduced ejection fraction; <i>ANKRD13D</i> and <i>TRIM69</i> for incident HF with reduced ejection fraction; <i>HPCAL1</i> and <i>PTTG1IP</i> for prevalent HF with reduced ejection fraction; and <i>ZNF146</i> (close to the <i>COX7A1</i> enzyme) and <i>ZFP3</i> (close to <i>SLC52A1</i>-the riboflavin transporter) for incident HF with reduced ejection fraction. We tested the HF-related top single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the UK biobank, where <i>rs77059055</i> in <i>TPM1</i> (minor allele frequency, 0.023; odds ratio, 0.83; <i>P</i>=0.002) remained statistically significant upon Bonferroni correction.Our integrative transomics approach offers insights into potential molecular and genetic contributors to HF and its precursors. Although several of our candidate genes have been implicated in HF in animal models, independent replication is warranted."	"Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) is a protein that constitutes the sarcomere filaments and is encoded by the TPM1 gene. The aim of the present study is to investigate the correlation between the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TPM1 gene and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).A total of 245 patients with DCM and 245 healthy controls were recruited with 5 ml of venous blood. Genomic DNA was extracted to analyze the TPM1 gene rs12148828, rs11558748, rs707602, rs6738, rs7178040 loci genotypes, and the plasma miR-21 level was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).The risk of DCM development in the rs6738 locus G allele carriers were 1.69 times more than A allele carriers (95% CI: 1.22-2.33, P = .001). Age and gender had no effect on the association of TPM1 gene SNPs with DCM risk (P &gt; .05). The plasma miR-21 level of TPM1 gene rs6738 locus AA carriers was significantly higher than that of the AG and GG genotypes (P &lt; .001).The SNPs of TPM1 gene rs6738 locus is associated with the risk of DCM, which may be related to the abnormal increase of miR-21 level in DCM patients, but further research is needed to prove the causal relationship between miR-21 level and DCM risk."	"The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play important roles in the development and progression of diabetes-related vascular complications. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. This study was designed to investigate the influences of tanshinone IIA, an active compound extracted from Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, on the proliferation and migration of human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs). cultured in a high glucose medium and the underlying mechanisms related miRNAs. Using a miRNA microarray method, we profiled the miRNA expression signature in human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs) exposed to normal glucose, high glucose with and without Tanshinone IIA. Cell proliferation was measured with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Cell migration was evaluated using transwell migration assay and wound scratch assay. Western blot was used to examine the expression of tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) and miRNA level was quantified by real-time PCR. The results showed that several miRNAs that were highly expressed in the high glucose group were significantly decreased in the high glucose with Tanshinone IIA group compared with the normal glucose group (P &lt; 0.05). Among these miRNAs, miR-21-5p was significantly upregulated in the high glucose group and downregulated after Tanshinone IIA treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The depletion of miR-21-5p in HASMCs resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, we found that Tanshinone IIA inhibited proliferation and migration partly through miR-21-5p-mediated TPM1 downregulation (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Tanshinone IIA is able to protect HASMCs from high glucose-induced proliferation and migration through regulating expression of miRNAs."	"In the heart, mutations in the TPM1 gene encoding the α-isoform of tropomyosin lead, in particular, to the development of hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. We compared the effects of hypertrophic, D175N and E180G, and dilated, E40K and E54K, cardiomyopathy mutations in TPM1 gene on the properties of single actin-myosin interactions and the characteristics of the calcium regulation in an ensemble of myosin molecules immobilised on a glass surface and interacting with regulated thin filaments. Previously, we showed that at saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration the presence of Tpm on the actin filament increases the duration of the interaction. Here, we found that the studied Tpm mutations differently affected the duration: the D175N mutation reduced it compared to WT Tpm, while the E180G mutation increased it. Both dilated mutations made the duration of the interaction even shorter than with F-actin. The duration of the attached state of myosin to the thin filament in the optical trap did not correlate to the sliding velocity of thin filaments and its calcium sensitivity in the in vitro motility assay. We suppose that at the level of the molecular ensemble, the cooperative mechanisms prevail in the manifestation of the effects of cardiomyopathy-associated mutations in Tpm."	"MicroRNA‑183 (miR‑183) is a small, non‑coding RNA that is involved in post‑transcriptional processes, is upregulated in gastric cancer and acts as an oncogene in cancer migration. Although fragmentary reports have demonstrated the importance of miR‑183 in gastric cancer, its biofunctions and regulatory effects are still unknown. In the present study, the gene and protein expression levels were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The connection between miR‑183‑5p.1 and tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) was tested through luciferase reporter experiments. Cell viability, apoptosis and related proteins were detected by MTT assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and western blotting, respectively. The migration and invasion of AGS cells modulated by miR‑183‑5p.1 were analyzed by Transwell assay. TPM1 expression was found to be decreased in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines when compared with normal and adjacent tissues and gastric epithelial cells, and was regulated by miR‑183‑5p.1 targeting TPM1. miR‑183‑5p.1 overexpression facilitated the growth and suppressed the death of AGS cells through Bcl‑2 and P53 proteins. In addition, miR‑183‑5p.1 restricted TPM1, TPM2 and TPM3 protein expression in AGS cells. The excessive levels of miR‑183‑5p.1 promoted the migration and invasion of AGS cells, and inhibited the apoptosis of AGS cells. However, the knockdown of miR‑183‑5p.1 induced the opposite in AGS cells. In conclusion, miR‑183‑5p.1 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion by downregulating TPM1 and deactivating the Bcl‑2/P53 signaling pathways in gastric cancer, indicating that miR‑183‑5p.1 and TPM1 may be potential targets for the diagnosis or therapy of gastric cancer in the future."	"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated primarily with pathogenic mutations in sarcomeric genes. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and distribution of disease-causing mutations in HCM-associated genes and the genotype-phenotype relationship in Vietnamese patients with HCM.Methods and Results:Genetic testing was performed by next-generation sequencing in 104 unrelated probands for 23 HCM-related genes and in 57 family members for the mutation(s) detected. Clinical manifestations were recorded for genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. Mutation detection rate was 43.4%. Mutations inMYBPC3accounted for 38.6%, followed byTPM1(20.5%),MYH7(18.2%),TNNT2(9.1%),TNNI3(4.5%) andMYL2(2.3%). A mutation inGLAassociated with Fabry disease was found in 1 patient. A mutation inTPM1(c.842T&gt;C, p.Met281Thr) was identified in 8 unrelated probands (18.2%) and 8 family members from 5 probands. Genotype-positive status related toMYH7,TPM1, andTNNT2mutations was associated with severe clinical manifestations.MYH7-positive patients displayed worse prognosis compared withMYBPC3-positive patients. Interestingly,TPM1c.842T&gt;C mutation was associated with high penetrance and severe HCM phenotype.We report for the first time the prevalence of HCM-related gene variants in Vietnamese patients with HCM.MYH7,TPM1, andTNNT2mutations were associated with unfavorable prognosis."	"Traditional Chinese medicine has been proven to be effective in treating human diseases according to a long-term observation for more than 2000 years. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of a majority of the medications are still largely unknown. Deer antler has been clinically used as an effective animal medication in traditional Chinese medicine for many centuries. Previous studies have demonstrated that antler extracts play crucial roles in promoting bone and cartilage development, growth and repair. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we applied isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology and a systematic bioinformatics analysis accompanied with validation method to obtain a full spectrum of the serum protein profiles under deer antler extract treatment. We identified a complex interaction network formed by the positive regulation of Tropomyosins (Tpm1, 2 and 4), WD repeat-containing protein 1 (Wdr1), Alpha-actinin-1 (Actn1) and Destrin (Dstn) and the negative regulation of Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2m), Serine protease inhibitor A3 N (Serpina3n) and Apolipoproteins (Apoh and Apof), which coordinately interact with multiple proteins and signaling pathways. Our results suggest that the therapeutic effects of deer antler extract on treating bone diseases might achieved though the regulation of bone formation and remodeling by controlling a series of serum proteins and signaling pathways that were essential for osteoblast and osteoclast activities. Thus, this study has greatly deepened the current knowledge about the molecular mechanism of therapeutic effects of deer antler extract on bone diseases such as osteoporosis."	"Tropomyosin is the major regulator of the thin filament. In striated muscle its function is to bind troponin complex and control the access of myosin heads to actin in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. It also participates in the maintenance of thin filament length by regulation of tropomodulin and leiomodin, the pointed end-binding proteins. Because the size of the overlap between actin and myosin filaments affects the number of myosin heads which interact with actin, the filament length is one of the determinants of force development. Numerous point mutations in genes encoding tropomyosin lead to single amino acid substitutions along the entire length of the coiled coil that are associated with various types of cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle disease. Specific regions of tropomyosin interact with different binding partners; therefore, the mutations affect diverse tropomyosin functions. In this review, results of studies on mutations in the genes TPM1 and TPM3, encoding Tpm1.1 and Tpm3.12, are described. The paper is particularly focused on mutation-dependent alterations in the mechanisms of actin-myosin interactions and dynamics of the thin filament at the pointed end."
"ALPK3"	"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"	"The most common injury of preterm infants is periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and to date there is still no safe and effective treatment. In our previous studies, leptin has been found to have neuroprotective effects on the preterm ischemia-hypoxia brain damage model rats in animal behavior. To gain insight into the neuroprotective mechanisms of leptin on preterm brain damage model rats, we constructed a comparative peptidomic profiling of hippocampal tissue between leptin-treated after model and preterm ischemia-hypoxia brain damage model rats using a stable isobaric labeling strategy involving tandem mass tag reagents, followed by nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We identified and quantified 4164 peptides, 238 of which were differential expressed in hippocampal tissue in the two groups. A total of 150 peptides were up regulated and 88 peptides were down regulated. These peptides were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and identified putative roles in nervous system development, function and diseases. We concluded that the preterm ischemia-hypoxia brain damage model with leptin treatment induced peptides changes in hippocampus, and these peptides, especially for the peptides associated &quot;microtubule-associated protein 1b (MAP1b), Elastin (Eln), Piccolo presynaptic cytomatrix protein (Pclo), Zinc finger homeobox 3(Zfhx3), Alpha-kinase 3(Alpk3) and Myosin XVA(Myo15a) &quot;, could be candidate bio-active peptides and participate in neuroprotection of leptin. These may advance our current understanding of the mechanism of leptin's neuroprotective effect on preterm brain damage and may be involved in the etiology of preterm brain damage. Meanwhile, we found that repression of ILK signaling pathway plays a significant role in neuroprotection of leptin. A better understanding of the role of ILK signaling pathway in neuroprotective mechanisms will help scientists and researchers to develop selective, safe and efficacious drug for therapy against human nervous system disorders."	"The genetic basis of left ventricular (LV) image-derived phenotypes, which play a vital role in the diagnosis, management, and risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases, is unclear at present.The LV parameters were measured from the cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies of the UK Biobank. Genotyping was done using Affymetrix arrays, augmented by imputation. We performed genome-wide association studies of 6 LV traits-LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, LV stroke volume, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio. The replication analysis was performed in the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). We identified the candidate genes at genome-wide significant loci based on the evidence from extensive bioinformatic analyses. Polygenic risk scores were constructed from the summary statistics of LV genome-wide association studies to predict the heart failure events.The study comprised 16 923 European UK Biobank participants (mean age 62.5 years; 45.8% men) without prevalent myocardial infarction or heart failure. We discovered 14 genome-wide significant loci (3 loci each for LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio; 4 loci for LV ejection fraction, and 1 locus for LV mass) at a stringent <i>P</i>&lt;1×10<sup>-8</sup>. Three loci were replicated at Bonferroni significance and 7 loci at nominal significance (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05 with concordant direction of effect) in the MESA study (n=4383). Follow-up bioinformatic analyses identified 28 candidate genes that were enriched in the cardiac developmental pathways and regulation of the LV contractile mechanism. Eight genes (<i>TTN, BAG3, GRK5, HSPB7, MTSS1, ALPK3, NMB</i>, and <i>MMP11</i>) supported by at least 2 independent lines of in silico evidence were implicated in the cardiac morphogenesis and heart failure development. The polygenic risk scores of LV phenotypes were predictive of heart failure in a holdout UK Biobank sample of 3106 cases and 224 134 controls (odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.26 - 1.58, for the top quintile versus the bottom quintile of the LV end-systolic volume risk score).We report 14 genetic loci and indicate several candidate genes that not only enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of prognostically important LV phenotypes but also shed light on potential novel therapeutic targets for LV remodeling."	"The purpose of this overview is to increase clinician awareness of the genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the benefits of early diagnosis and management to individuals with genetic HCM. The goals of this overview are the following. GOAL 1: Define HCM. GOAL 2: Identify the categories of HCM. GOAL 3: Provide the evaluation strategy for a proband with HCM to establish (when possible) the specific genetic cause. GOAL 4: Provide a basic view of genetic risk assessment of at-risk asymptomatic relatives of a proband with HCM to inform cardiac surveillance and to allow early detection and treatment of HCM to improve long-term outcome."	"Cardiomyopathies are clinically heterogeneous disorders and are the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Different etiologies have a significant impact on prognosis. Recently, novel biallelic loss-of-function pathogenic variants in alpha-kinase 3 (ALPK3) were implicated in causing early-onset pediatric cardiomyopathy (cardiomyopathy, familial hypertrophic 27; OMIM 618052). To date, eight patients, all presented during early childhood, were reported with biallelic ALPK3 pathogenic variants. We describe the molecular and clinical phenotype characterization of familial cardiomyopathy on one family with six affected individuals. We identified homozygosity for an ALPK3 deleterious sequence variant (NM_020778.4:c.639G&gt;A:p.Trp213*) in all the affected individuals. They presented with either dilated cardiomyopathy that progressed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or HCM with left ventricular noncompaction. The age of presentation in our cohort extends between infancy to the fourth decade. The phenotypic severity decreases with the progression of age."	"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary solid malignancy of the bone, and its high mortality usually correlates with early metastasis. In this study, we developed a risk score model to help predict metastasis at the time of diagnosis. We downloaded and mined four expression profile datasets associated with osteosarcoma metastasis from the Gene Expression Omnibus. After data normalization, we performed LASSO logistic regression analysis together with 10-fold cross validation using the GSE21257 dataset. A combination of eight genes (<i>RAB1</i>,<i>CLEC3B</i>,<i>FCGBP</i>,<i>RNASE3</i>,<i>MDL1</i>,<i>ALOX5AP</i>,<i>VMO1</i> and <i>ALPK3</i>) were identified as being associated with osteosarcoma metastasis. These genes were put into a gene risk score model, and the prediction efficiency of the model was then validated using three independent datasets (GSE33383, GSE66673, and GSE49003) by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves. The expression levels of the eight genes in all datasets were shown as heatmaps, and gene ontology gene annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were performed. These eight genes play a role in cancer-related biological processes, such as apoptosis and biosynthetic processes. Our results may aid in elucidating the possible mechanisms of osteosarcoma metastasis, and may help to facilitate the individual management of patients with osteosarcoma after treatment."	"Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a complex disease with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Recently, the ALPK3 gene was described as a new hereditary cardiomyopathy gene underlying pediatric cardiomyopathies. Only eight patients carrying mutations in ALPK3 have been reported to date. Here, we report a 3-year-old male patient with both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient presented dysmorphic features and skeletal deformities of hands and feet, pectus excavatum, and cleft palate. The genetic investigation was performed by whole-exome sequencing in the patient and his parents. We identified a novel homozygous mutation in ALPK3 (c.1531_1532delAA; p.Lys511Argfs*12). Our work extends the phenotypic spectrum of the ALPK3-associated cardiomyopathy by reporting additional clinical features. This is the first study of a Tunisian patient with mutation in the ALPK3 gene. In conclusion, ALPK3 should be included in the list of genes to be considered in genetic studies for patients affected with pediatric syndromic cardiomyopathy."	"Primary cardiomyopathy is one of the most common inherited cardiac diseases and harbors significant phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Because of this, genetic testing has become standard in treatment of this disease group. Indeed, in recent years, next-generation DNA sequencing has found broad applications in medicine, both as a routine diagnostic tool for genetic disorders and as a high-throughput discovery tool for identifying novel disease-causing genes. We describe a male infant with primary dilated cardiomyopathy who was diagnosed using intrauterine echocardiography and found to progress to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy after birth. This proband was born to a nonconsanguineous family with a past history of a male fetus that died because of cardiac abnormalities at 30 wk of gestation. Using whole-exome sequencing, a novel homozygous frameshift mutation (c.2018delC; p.Gln675SerfsX30) in <i>ALPK3</i> was identified and confirmed with Sanger sequencing. Heterozygous family members were normal with echocardiographic examination. To date, only two studies have reported homozygous pathogenic variants of <i>ALPK3,</i> with a total of seven affected individuals with cardiomyopathy from four unrelated consanguineous families. We include a discussion of the patient's phenotypic features and a review of relevant literature findings."	"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure with a strong familial component. We performed an exome-wide array-based association study (EWAS) to assess the contribution of missense variants to sporadic DCM.116,855 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 2796 DCM patients and 6877 control subjects from 6 populations of European ancestry. We confirmed two previously identified associations with SNVs in BAG3 and ZBTB17 and discovered six novel DCM-associated loci (Q-value&lt;0.01). The lead-SNVs at novel loci are common and located in TTN, SLC39A8, MLIP, FLNC, ALPK3 and FHOD3. In silico fine mapping identified HSPB7 as the most likely candidate at the ZBTB17 locus. Rare variant analysis (MAF&lt;0.01) demonstrated significant association for TTN variants only (P = 0.0085). All candidate genes but one (SLC39A8) exhibit preferential expression in striated muscle tissues and mutations in TTN, BAG3, FLNC and FHOD3 are known to cause familial cardiomyopathy. We also investigated a panel of 48 known cardiomyopathy genes. Collectively, rare (n = 228, P = 0.0033) or common (n = 36, P = 0.019) variants with elevated in silico severity scores were associated with DCM, indicating that the spectrum of genes contributing to sporadic DCM extends beyond those identified here.We identified eight loci independently associated with sporadic DCM. The functions of the best candidate genes at these loci suggest that proteostasis regulation might play a role in DCM pathophysiology."	"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a prototypic single-gene disease caused mainly by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. Despite the remarkable advances, the causal genes in ≈40% of the HCM cases remain unknown, typically in small families and sporadic cases, wherein cosegregation could not be established.To test the hypothesis that the missing causal genes in HCM is, in part, because of an oligogenic cause, wherein the pathogenic variants do not cosegregate with the phenotype.A clinically affected trio with HCM underwent clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and whole exome sequencing. Pathogenic variants in the whole exome sequencing data were identified using established algorithms. Family members were genotyped by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation was analyzed. The siblings had a severe course, whereas the mother had a mild course. Variant analysis showed that the trio shared 145 heterozygous pathogenic variants in 139 genes, including 2 in cardiomyopathy genes <i>TTN</i> and <i>ALPK3</i>. The siblings also had the pathogenic variant p.Ala13Thr variant in <i>MYL2</i>, a known gene for HCM. The sibling's father also carried the p.Ala13Thr variant, in whom an unambiguous diagnosis of HCM could not be made because of concomitant severe aortic stenosis. The <i>TTN</i> variant segregated with HCM, except in a 7-year-old boy, who had a normal phenotype. The <i>ALPK3</i> variant, shared by the affected trio, did not segregate with the phenotype.We posit that a subset of HCM might be oligogenic caused by multiple pathogenic variants that do not perfectly cosegregate with the phenotype."	"We identified a novel homozygous truncating mutation in the gene encoding alpha kinase 3 (ALPK3) in a family presenting with paediatric cardiomyopathy. A recent study identified biallelic truncating mutations of ALPK3 in three unrelated families; therefore, there is strong genetic evidence that ALPK3 mutation causes cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to clarify the mutation mechanism and investigate the molecular and cellular pathogenesis underlying ALPK3-mediated cardiomyopathy.We performed detailed clinical and genetic analyses of a consanguineous family, identifying a new ALPK3 mutation (c.3792G&gt;A, p.W1264X) which undergoes nonsense-mediated decay in ex vivo and in vivo tissues. Ultra-structural analysis of cardiomyocytes derived from patient-specific and human ESC-derived stem cell lines lacking ALPK3 revealed disordered sarcomeres and intercalated discs. Multi-electrode array analysis and calcium imaging demonstrated an extended field potential duration and abnormal calcium handling in mutant contractile cultures.This study validates the genetic evidence, suggesting that mutations in ALPK3 can cause familial cardiomyopathy and demonstrates loss of function as the underlying genetic mechanism. We show that ALPK3-deficient cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cell models recapitulate the ultrastructural and electrophysiological defects observed in vivo. Analysis of differentiated contractile cultures identified abnormal calcium handling as a potential feature of cardiomyocytes lacking ALPK3, providing functional insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ALPK3-mediated cardiomyopathy."	"Cardiomyopathies are usually inherited and predominantly affect adults, but they can also present in childhood. Although our understanding of the molecular basis of pediatric cardiomyopathy has improved, the underlying mechanism remains elusive in a substantial proportion of cases.This study aimed to identify new genes involved in pediatric cardiomyopathy.The authors performed homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in 2 consanguineous families with idiopathic pediatric cardiomyopathy. Sixty unrelated patients with pediatric cardiomyopathy were subsequently screened for mutations in a candidate gene. First-degree relatives were submitted to cardiac screening and cascade genetic testing. Myocardial samples from 2 patients were processed for histological and immunohistochemical studies.We identified 5 patients from 3 unrelated families with pediatric cardiomyopathy caused by homozygous truncating mutations in ALPK3, a gene encoding a nuclear kinase that plays an essential role in early differentiation of cardiomyocytes. All patients with biallelic mutations presented with severe hypertrophic and/or dilated cardiomyopathy in utero, at birth, or in early childhood. Three patients died from heart failure within the first week of life. Moreover, 2 of 10 (20%) heterozygous family members showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with an atypical distribution of hypertrophy. Deficiency of alpha-kinase 3 has previously been associated with features of both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy in mice. Consistent with studies in knockout mice, we provide microscopic evidence for intercalated disc remodeling.Biallelic truncating mutations in the newly identified gene ALPK3 give rise to severe, early-onset cardiomyopathy in humans. Our findings highlight the importance of transcription factor pathways in the molecular mechanisms underlying human cardiomyopathies."	"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for their derivation from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst represent a valuable in vitro model to investigate the effects of ionizing radiation on early embryonic cellular response. Following irradiation, both human and mouse ESCs (mESCs) maintain their pluripotent status and the capacity to differentiate into embryoid bodies and to form teratomas. Although informative of the maintenance of a pluripotent status, these studies never investigated the capability of irradiated ESCs to form specific differentiated phenotypes. Here, for the first time, 5Gy-irradiated mESCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes, thus allowing the analysis of the long-term effects of ionizing radiations on the differentiation potential of a pluripotent stem cell population. On treated mESCs, 96h after irradiation, a genome-wide expression analysis was first performed in order to determine whether the treatment influenced gene expression of the surviving mESCs. Microarrays analysis showed that only 186 genes were differentially expressed in treated mESCs compared to control cells; a quarter of these genes were involved in cellular differentiation, with three main gene networks emerging, including cardiogenesis. Based on these results, we differentiated irradiated mESCs into cardiomyocytes. On day 5, 8 and 12 of differentiation, treated cells showed a significant alteration (qRT-PCR) of the expression of marker genes (Gata-4, Nkx-2.5, Tnnc1 and Alpk3) when compared to control cells. At day 15 of differentiation, although the organization of sarcomeric α-actinin and troponin T proteins appeared similar in cardiomyocytes differentiated from either mock or treated cells, the video evaluation of the kinematics and dynamics of the beating cardiac syncytium evidenced altered contractile properties of cardiomyocytes derived from irradiated mESCs. This alteration correlated with significant reduction of Connexin 43 foci. Our results indicate that mESCs populations that survive an ionizing irradiation treatment are capable to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, but they have altered contractile properties. "	"Cardiomyopathy developed in mice deficient for α-kinase 3 (ALPK3), a nuclear kinase previously implicated in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes. Alpk3               (-/-) mice were produced according to normal Mendelian ratios and appeared normal except for a nonprogressive cardiomyopathy that had features of both hypertrophic and dilated forms of cardiomyopathy. Cardiac hypertrophy in Alpk3               (-/-) mice was characterized by increased thickness of both left and right ventricular (LV and RV) walls and by markedly increased heart weight and increased heart weight/body weight and heart weight/tibia length ratios. Magnetic resonance imaging studies confirmed the increased thickness in both septal and LV free walls at end-diastole, although there was no significant change in LV wall thickness at end-systole. Myocardial hypertrophy was the predominant feature in Alpk3               (-/-) mice, but several changes more typically associated with dilated cardiomyopathy included a marked increase in end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volume, as well as reduced cardiac output, stroke volume, and ejection fractions, suggesting LV chamber dilation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 50% reduction in both septal and free wall LV contractility in Alpk3               (-/-) mice. Interstitial fibrosis and inflammation were notably absent in Alpk3               (-/-) mice; however, light and electron microscopy revealed altered cardiomyocyte architecture, characterized by reduced numbers of abnormal intercalated discs being associated with mild disarray of myofibrils. These lesions could account for the impaired contractility of the myofibrillar apparatus and contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in Alpk3               (-/-) mice."	"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) causes abnormalities during heart development. Cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells are a robust model for the study of early cardiomyogenesis. Here, we evaluated the effects of TCDD at key stages during the differentiation of mouse ES cells into cardiomyocytes analysing: (i) the transcription of lineage differentiation (Brachyury, Nkx-2.5, Actc-1), cardiac-specific (Alpk3, cTnT, cTnI, cTnC) and detoxification phase I (Cyp1A1, Cyp1A2 and Cyp1B1) and phase II (Nqo1, Gsta1 and Ugt1a6) genes; (ii) the global gene expression; (iii) the ultrastructure of ES-derived cardiomyocytes; (iv) level of ATP production and (v) the immunolocalisation of sarcomeric α-actinin, β-myosin heavy chain and cTnT proteins. We show that TCDD affects the differentiation of ES cells into cardiomyocytes at several levels: (1) induces the expression of phase I genes; (2) down-regulates a group of heart-specific genes, some involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway; (3) reduces the efficiency of differentiation; (4) alters the arrangement of mitochondria, that show twisted and disrupted cristae, and of some sarcomeres, with misalignement or disarrangement of the myofibrillar organisation and (5) reduces ATP production. This study provides novel evidences that TCDD impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation. Sarcomeres and mitochondria could be a target for dioxin toxicity, their disruption representing a possible mechanism developing cardiac injury."	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
