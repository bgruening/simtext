"SCN1A"	"epilepsy"	32554600	32549268	32544858	32540801	32538476	"Dravet syndrome is a developmental epileptic encephalopathy caused by pathogenic variation in SCN1A. To characterize the pathogenic substitution (p.H939R) of a local individual with Dravet syndrome, fibroblast cells from the individual were reprogrammed to pluripotent stem cells and differentiated into neurons. Sodium currents of these neurons were compared with healthy control induced neurons. A novel Scn1a<sup>H939R/+</sup> mouse model was generated with the p.H939R substitution. Immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological experiments were performed on hippocampal slices of Scn1a<sup>H939R/+</sup> mice. We found that the sodium currents recorded in the proband-induced neurons were significantly smaller and slower compared to wild-type. The resting membrane potential and spike amplitude were significantly depolarized in the proband-induced neurons. Similar differences in resting membrane potential and spike amplitude were observed in the interneurons of the hippocampus of Scn1a<sup>H939R/+</sup> mice. The Scn1a<sup>H939R/+</sup> mice showed the characteristic features of a Dravet-like phenotype: increased mortality and both spontaneous and heat-induced seizures. Immunohistochemistry showed a reduction in amount of parvalbumin and vesicular acetylcholine transporter in the hippocampus of Scn1a<sup>H939R/+</sup> compared to wild-type mice. Overall, these results underline hyper-excitability of the hippocampal CA1 circuit of this novel mouse model of Dravet syndrome which, under certain conditions such as temperature, can trigger seizure activity. This hyper-excitability is due to the altered electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons and interneurons which are caused by the dysfunction of the sodium channel bearing the p.H939R substitution. This novel Dravet syndrome model also highlights the reduction in acetylcholine and the contribution of pyramidal cells, in addition to interneurons, to network hyper-excitability."	"An Italian family with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) with the absence of mutations in the known genes associated with this disorder, namely ATP1A2, ATP1A3, CACNA1A, and SCN1A, has recently been reported. Soon afterward, whole exome sequencing allowed the identification of the carrier status of a heterozygous ATP1A4 mutation c.1798 C &gt;T, in four affected members of this family. Here we compare the clinical symptoms of the affected family members with those from the other FHM families linked to mutations in the known genes associated with this disorder. A further two-year follow-up, including clinical response to carbamazepine administered to the proband and the maternal grandmother due to a worsening of the migraine symptoms, is reported. The clinical condition of the proband's brother, carrying the same mutation and suffering from congenital ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles, isdiscussed as well."	"Dravet syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by treatment-resistant polymorphic seizures, primarily caused by loss-of-function in the SCN1A gene. To develop an in vitro model of this disease, in a previously study we generated an induced pluripotent stem cell line from a 10-year-old boy carrying the NM_001165963.1:c.5768A to G (Q1923R) mutation in SCN1A. Using TALEN-mediated genome editing, we have now generated an isogenic control line in which the disease-causing mutation found in the epilepsy patient iPSCs was corrected, in order to eliminate the interference of different genetic backgrounds in future analyses."	"SCN1A is one of the most relevant epilepsy genes. In general, de novo severe mutations, such as truncating mutations, lead to a classic form of Dravet syndrome (DS), while missense mutations are associated with both DS and milder phenotypes within the GEFS+ spectrum, however, these phenotype-genotype correlations are not entirely consistent. Case report. We report an 18-year-old woman with a history of recurrent febrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) starting at age four months and afebrile asymmetric GTCS and episodes of arrest, suggestive of focal impaired awareness seizures, starting at nine months. Her psychomotor development was normal. Sequencing of SCN1A revealed a heterozygous de novo truncating mutation (c.5734C&gt;T, p.Arg1912X) in exon 26. Conclusion. Truncating mutations in SCN1A may be associated with milder phenotypes within the GEFS+ spectrum. Accordingly, SCN1A gene testing should be performed as part of the assessment for sporadic patients with mild phenotypes that fit within the GEFS+ spectrum, since the finding of a mutation has diagnostic, therapeutic and genetic counselling implications."	"Variants in the gene SCN1A are a common genetic cause for a wide range of epilepsy phenotypes ranging from febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome. Focal onset seizures and structural lesions can be present in these patients and the question arises whether epilepsy surgery should be considered. We report eight patients (mean age 13y 11mo [SD 8y 1mo], range 3-26y; four females, four males) with SCN1A variants, who underwent epilepsy surgery. Outcomes were variable and seemed to be directly related to the patient's anatomo-electroclinical epilepsy phenotype. Patients with Dravet syndrome had unfavourable outcomes, whilst patients with focal epilepsy, proven to arise from a single structural lesion, had good results. We conclude that the value of epilepsy surgery in patients with an SCN1A variant rests on two issues: understanding whether the variant is pathogenic and the patient's anatomo-electroclinical phenotype. Careful evaluation of epilepsy phenotype integrated with understanding the significance of genetic variants is essential in determining a patient's suitability for epilepsy surgery. Patients with focal onset epilepsy may benefit from epilepsy surgery, whereas those with Dravet syndrome do not."
"SCN9A"	"epilepsy"	32531456	29419974	32517404	32511987	32466254	"A 30-year-old man presented with intellectual disability associated with epilepsy. The epilepsy was initially treated with sodium valproate and since he was 28 years-old with lamotrigine. With the addition of lamotrigine, a pattern of Brugada syndrome appeared on the electrocardiogram. The family history was positive for epilepsy from the motheŕs side, who had never been treated with lamotrigine. Determine the genetic cause of the intellectual disability, epilepsy and Brugada syndrome of the patient and try to establish a possible correlation between the genetic background and the Brugada syndrome pattern under lamotrigine treatment. A standard karyotype, array comparative genomic hybridization and two different NGS panels have done to the index case to identify the genetic causes of the intellectual disability, epilepsy and Brugada syndrome pattern. Genetic analyses in the family identified a de novo duplication of 1.3 Mb in 8p21.3 as well as two novel heterozygous rare variants in SCN9A and AKAP9 genes, both inherited from the mother. We hypothesize that in this family the SCN9A variant was responsible for the epileptic syndrome. In addition, given that SCN9A is lightly expressed in the heart tissue, we postulate that this SCN9A variant, alone or in combination with AKAP9 variant, might be responsible for the Brugada pattern when challenged by lamotrigine."	"Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is one of the most common complications of herpes zoster (HZ). Heritable factors have been found to play a role in various clinical pain symptoms. However, the effect of gene variability on the susceptibility of PHN remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether genetic variation in pain pathway genes was associated with PHN susceptibility in the Chinese population. Case-control study. Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine in a university hospital. Seventy patients with PHN and 111 patients with HZ without developing PHN were enrolled. All patients received standardized antiviral agents and analgesics as needed during the acute phase of HZ. Twenty-four candidate genetic polymorphisms in 12 genes (IL1B, SCN9A, KCNK9, TRPV1, P2RX7, HTR1A, HTR2A, ADRB1, ADRB2, BDNF, COMT, and OPRM1) were genotyped in all patients. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify genetic variations associated with PHN susceptibility while controlling for potential confounders. Our results suggested that only variation in P2RX7 gene was associated with PHN susceptibility. The P2RX7 rs7958311 AG heterozygous genotype carriers had a decreased risk for PHN in the overdominant model (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.77; P = 0.005), and codominant model (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.98; P = 0.045). The P2RX7 rs7958311 GG homozygote genotype was associated with an increased risk for PHN under a recessive model (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.01-4.56; P = 0.046). There were no significant associations between the other 23 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and PHN susceptibility. Lack of validation cohort to verify the findings. In the present study in the Chinese population, we found purinergic receptor P2X7 rs7958311 may contribute to PHN development after HZ. Future larger independent cohorts are warranted to replicate these initial findings. Herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, polymorphisms."	"Management of chronic pain presents a major challenge, since many currently available treatments lack efficacy and have problems such as addiction and tolerance. Loss of function mutations in the SCN9A gene lead to a congenital inability to feel pain, with no other sensory deficits aside from anosmia. SCN9A encodes the voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel 1.7 (NaV1.7), which has been identified as a primary pain target. However, in developing NaV1.7-targeted analgesics, extreme care must to be taken to avoid off-target activity on other NaV subtypes that are critical for survival. Since spider venoms are an excellent source of NaV channel modulators, we screened a panel of spider venoms to identify selective NaV1.7 inhibitors. This led to identification of two novel NaV modulating venom peptides (β/μ-theraphotoxin-Pe1a and β/μ-theraphotoxin-Pe1b (Pe1b) from the arboreal tarantula Phormingochilus everetti. A third peptide isolated from the tarantula Bumba pulcherrimaklaasi was identical to the well-known ProTx-I (β/ω-theraphotoxin-Tp1a) from the tarantula Thrixopelma pruriens. A tethered toxin (t-toxin)-based alanine scanning strategy was used to determine the NaV1.7 pharmacophore of ProTx-I. We designed several ProTx-I and Pe1b analogues, and tested them for activity and NaV channel subtype selectivity. Several analogues had improved potency against NaV1.7, and altered specificity against other NaV channels. These analogues provide a foundation for development of Pe1b as a lead molecule for therapeutic inhibition of NaV1.7."	"Episodic Ataxias (EAs) are a small group (EA1-EA8) of complex neurological conditions that manifest as incidents of poor balance and coordination. Diagnostic testing cannot always find causative variants for the phenotype, however, and this along with the recently proposed EA type 9 (EA9), suggest that more EA genes are yet to be discovered. We previously identified disease-causing mutations in the CACNA1A gene in 48% (n = 15) of 31 patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of EA2, and referred to our laboratory for CACNA1A gene testing, leaving 52% of these cases (n = 16) with no molecular diagnosis. In this study, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 16 patients who tested negative for CACNA1A mutations. Tiered analysis of WES data was performed to first explore (Tier-1) the ataxia and ataxia-associated genes (n = 170) available in the literature and databases for comprehensive EA molecular genetic testing; we then investigated 353 ion channel genes (Tier-2). Known and potential causal variants were identified in n = 8/16 (50%) patients in 8 genes (SCN2A, p.Val1325Phe; ATP1A3, p.Arg756His; PEX7, p.Tyr40Ter; and KCNA1, p.Arg167Met; CLCN1, p.Gly945ArgfsX39; CACNA1E, p.Ile614Val; SCN1B, p.Cys121Trp; and SCN9A, p.Tyr1217Ter). These results suggest that mutations in these genes might cause an ataxia phenotype or that combinations of more than one mutation contribute to ataxia disorders."	NA

Schisandra chinensis is a natural herb that can treat the effects of AD, but its specific mechanism is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential components and pharmacological pathways of S. chinensis in the treatment of AD. In this study, we investigated the compound of S. chinensis and the effects of it on AD by network pharmacology. Meanwhile, the potential mechanism was proved in vitro. The results showed that S. chinensis contained 173 compounds. Compound-target network confirmed that (E)-9-Isopropyl-6-Methyl-5,9-Decadiene-2-One, 1-Phenyl-1,3-Butanedion, nootkatone and phenyl-2-Propanone were the main chemical constituents which highly aimed at APOE, CACNA1D, GRIN2A, and PTGS2. KEGG and GO enrichment analysis indicated that the main pathways involved neural-related signaling pathways and functions, such as nicotine addiction, GABAergic synapse, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway, AD, and so on. Validation experiments showed that nootkatone was able to exert anti-apoptotic effects related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway by inhibiting nitric oxide production, enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, upregulating the expression of anti-oxidation and anti-apoptotic proteins in vitro. These results illustrated that S. chinensis could regulate neuronal apoptosis through the calcium signaling pathway to exert anti-AD by integrating multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway."	"Converging evidence implicates redox dysregulation as a pathological mechanism driving the emergence of psychosis. Increased oxidative damage and decreased capacity of intracellular redox modulatory systems are consistent findings in persons with schizophrenia as well as in persons at clinical high risk who subsequently developed frank psychosis. Levels of glutathione, a key regulator of cellular redox status, are reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus in schizophrenia. In humans with schizophrenia and in rodent models recapitulating various features of schizophrenia, redox dysregulation is linked to reductions of parvalbumin containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons and volumes of their perineuronal nets, white matter abnormalities, and microglia activation. Importantly, the activity of transcription factors, kinases, and phosphatases regulating diverse aspects of neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity varies according to cellular redox state. Molecules regulating interneuron function under redox control include NMDA receptor subunits GluN1 and GluN2A as well as KEAP1 (regulator of transcription factor NRF2). In a rodent schizophrenia model characterized by impaired glutathione synthesis, the Gclm knockout mouse, oxidative stress activated MMP9 (matrix metalloprotease 9) via its redox-responsive regulatory sites, causing a cascade of molecular events leading to microglia activation, perineural net degradation, and impaired NMDA receptor function. Molecular pathways under redox control are implicated in the etiopathology of schizophrenia and are attractive drug targets for individualized drug therapy trials in the contexts of prevention and treatment of psychosis."	"The diagnosis of primary adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder may be challenging in routine practice. These tumors may morphologically and immunohistochemically overlap with urachal adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma. Further, their genetic background is poorly understood. We systematically searched the PubMed database for results of complex genetic evaluation of primary bladder adenocarcinoma subtypes. Subsequently, we designed our own series of bladder lesions. We evaluated 36 cases: 16 primary enteric-type adenocarcinomas, 7 urachal enteric adenocarcinomas, 3 primary mucinous/colloid adenocarcinomas, and 10 intestinal-type metaplasia/villous adenoma. Detailed clinical data were collected, and all cases were examined using targeted next-generation sequencing. On the basis of the literature, the first mutated gene in these tumors was reported to be KRAS in 11.3% of cases, followed by TERT promoter mutations in 28.5%. In addition to KRAS and TERT, other genes were also found to be frequently mutated in primary bladder adenocarcinoma, including TP53, PIK3CA, CTNNB1, APC, FBXW7, IDH2, and RB1. In our series, the most frequent gene mutations in primary enteric-type adenocarcinomas were as follows: TP53 (56%); BRCA2, KMT2B (both 33%); NOTCH2, KDR, ARID1B, POLE, PTEN, KRAS (all 28%); in urachal enteric adenocarcinoma they were as follows: TP53 (86%); PTEN, NOTCH (both 43%); in primary mucinous/colloid adenocarcinomas they were as follows: KRAS, GRIN2A, AURKB (all 67%); and, in intestinal-type metaplasia/villous adenoma, they were as follows: APC, PRKDC (both 60%); ROS1, ATM, KMT2D (all 50%). No specific mutational pattern was identified using cluster analysis for any of the groups. Herein, we describe the pathologic features and immunohistochemical staining patterns traditionally used in the differential diagnoses of glandular lesions of the bladder in routine surgical pathology. We outline the mutational landscape of these lesions as an aggregate of published data with additional data from our cohort. Although diagnostically not discriminatory, we document that the most common genetic alterations shared between these glandular neoplasms include TP53, APC (in the Wnt pathway), and KRAS (in the MAPK pathway) mutations."	"Food consumption is fundamental for life, and eating disorders often result in devastating or life-threatening conditions. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by a persistent restriction of energy intake, leading to lowered body weight, constant fear of gaining weight, and psychological disturbances of body perception. Herein, we demonstrate that SIRT1 inhibition, both genetically and pharmacologically, delays the onset and progression of AN behaviors in activity-based anorexia (ABA) models, while SIRT1 activation accelerates ABA phenotypes. Mechanistically, we suggest that SIRT1 promotes progression of ABA, in part through its interaction with NRF1, leading to suppression of a NMDA receptor subunit Grin2A. Our results suggest that AN may arise from pathological positive feedback loops: voluntary food restriction activates SIRT1, promoting anxiety, hyperactivity, and addiction to starvation, exacerbating the dieting and exercising, thus further activating SIRT1. We propose SIRT1 inhibition can break this cycle and provide a potential therapy for individuals suffering from AN."	"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia with very limited therapeutic options. Amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) are key pathogenic molecules in AD. P38α-MAPK is specifically activated in AD lesion sites. However, its effects on AD pathogenesis, especially on p-Tau-associated brain pathology, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We mated human APP-transgenic mice and human P301S Tau-transgenic mice with mapk14-floxed and neuron-specific Cre-knock-in mice. We observed that deletion of p38α-MAPK specifically in neurons improves the cognitive function of both 9-month-old APP and Tau-transgenic AD mice, which is associated with decreased Aβ and p-Tau load in the brain. We further used next-generation sequencing to analyze the gene transcription in brains of p38α-MAPK deficient and wild-type APP-transgenic mice, which indicated that deletion of p38α-MAPK regulates the transcription of calcium homeostasis-related genes, especially downregulates the expression of grin2a, a gene encoding NMDAR subunit NR2A. Cell culture experiments further verified that deletion of p38α-MAPK inhibits NMDA-triggered calcium influx and neuronal apoptosis. Our systemic studies of AD pathogenic mechanisms using both APP- and Tau-transgenic mice suggested that deletion of neuronal p38α-MAPK attenuates AD-associated brain pathology and protects neurons in AD pathogenesis. This study supports p38α-MAPK as a novel target for AD therapy."
"ANKRD11"	"autism"	32476269	32258089	32222090	32124548	32037394	"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), and KBG syndrome are three distinct developmental human disorders. Variants in seven genes belonging to the cohesin pathway, NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8, RAD21, ANKRD11, and BRD4, were identified in about 80% of patients with CdLS, suggesting that additional causative genes remain to be discovered. Two genes, CREBBP and EP300, have been associated with RSTS, whereas KBG results from variants in ANKRD11. By exome sequencing, a genetic cause was elucidated in two patients with clinical diagnosis of CdLS but without variants in known CdLS genes. In particular, genetic variants in EP300 and ANKRD11 were identified in the two patients with CdLS. EP300 and ANKRD11 pathogenic variants caused the reduction of the respective proteins suggesting that their low levels contribute to CdLS-like phenotype. These findings highlight the clinical overlap between CdLS, RSTS, and KBG and support the notion that these rare disorders are linked to abnormal chromatin remodeling, which in turn affects the transcriptional machinery."	"The incidence of short stature in KBG syndrome is relatively high. Data on the therapeutic effects of growth hormone (GH) on children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature in the previous literature has not been summarized. Here we studied a girl with KBG syndrome and collected the data of children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature from previous studies before and after GH therapy. The girl was referred to our department because of short stature. Physical examination revealed mild dysmorphic features. The peak GH responses to arginine and clonidine were 6.22 and 5.40 ng/mL, respectively. The level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was 42.0 ng/mL. Genetic analysis showed a c.2635 dupG (p.Glu879fs) mutation in the ANKRD11 gene. She received GH therapy. During the first year of GH therapy, her height increased by 0.92 standard deviation score (SDS). Her height increased from -1.95 SDS to -0.70 SDS after two years of GH therapy. There were ten children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature who received GH therapy in reported cases. Height SDS was improved in nine (9/10) of them. The mean height SDS in five children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature increased from -2.72 ± 0.44 to -1.95 ± 0.57 after the first year of GH therapy (P = 0.001). There were no adverse reactions reported after GH treatment. GH treatment is effective in our girl and most children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature during the first year of therapy."	"KBG syndrome is an intellectual disability (ID) associated with multiple congenital anomalies in which the macrodontia could be the clue for the diagnosis. It is caused either by heterozygous variant in ANKRD11 gene or 16q24.3 microdeletions that involve the ANKRD11 gene. Here, we report on two unrelated male patients who presented with ID, short stature, webbing of neck, and cryptorchidism. Noonan syndrome was suspected first but the presence of macrodontia in both patients pointed to KBG syndrome which was confirmed thereafter by the identification of a novel pathogenic variant in ANKRD11 gene, c.5488G&gt;T (p.E1830*). Macrodontia was noticed in all the deciduous anterior teeth in Patient 1. This observation was reported previously in few patients, but it seems to be a common feature that could be misdiagnosed as premature eruption of teeth. Therefore, our results confirm that maxillary permanent central incisors may not be the only teeth affected in KBG but also all the deciduous teeth. Interestingly, desquamative gingivitis was additionally noted in Patient 1, which has not been reported previously, however; it could be a coincidental finding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from Egypt."	"KBG syndrome (MIM #148050) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, distinct craniofacial anomalies, macrodontia of permanent upper central incisors, skeletal abnormalities, and short stature. This study describes clinical features of 28 patients, confirmed by molecular testing of ANKRD11 gene, and three patients with 16q24 deletion encompassing ANKRD11 gene, diagnosed in a single center. Common clinical features are reported, together with uncommon findings, clinical expression in the first years of age, distinctive associations, and familial recurrences. Unusual manifestations emerging from present series include juvenile idiopathic arthritis, dysfunctional dysphonia, multiple dental agenesis, idiopathic precocious telarche, oral frenula, motor tics, and lipoma of corpus callosum, pilomatrixoma, and endothelial corneal polymorphic dystrophy. Facial clinical markers suggesting KBG syndrome before 6 years of age include ocular and mouth conformation, wide eyebrows, synophrys, long black eyelashes, long philtrum, thin upper lip. General clinical symptoms leading to early genetic evaluation include developmental delay, congenital malformations, hearing anomalies, and feeding difficulties. It is likely that atypical clinical presentation and overlapping features in patients with multiple variants are responsible for underdiagnosis in KBG syndrome. Improved knowledge of common and atypical features of this disorder improves clinical management."	"This study investigated the diagnostic utility of nontargeted genomic testing in patients with pediatric heart disease. We analyzed genome sequencing data of 111 families with cardiac lesions for rare, disease-associated variation. In 14 families (12.6%), we identified causative variants: seven were de novo (ANKRD11, KMT2D, NR2F2, POGZ, PTPN11, PURA, SALL1) and six were inherited from parents with no or subclinical heart phenotypes (FLT4, DNAH9, MYH11, NEXMIF, NIPBL, PTPN11). Outcome of the testing was associated with the presence of extracardiac features (p = 0.02), but not a positive family history for cardiac lesions (p = 0.67). We also report novel plausible gene-disease associations for tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary stenosis (CDC42BPA, FGD5), hypoplastic left or right heart (SMARCC1, TLN2, TRPM4, VASP), congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (UBXN10), and early-onset cardiomyopathy (TPCN1). The identified candidate genes have critical functions in heart development, such as angiogenesis, mechanotransduction, regulation of heart size, chromatin remodeling, or ciliogenesis. This data set demonstrates the diagnostic and scientific value of genome sequencing in pediatric heart disease, anticipating its role as a first-tier diagnostic test. The genetic heterogeneity will necessitate large-scale genomic initiatives for delineating novel gene-disease associations."
"SHANK2"	"autism"	32564287	32547879	32268103	32252796	32252688	"Synaptic protein shanks (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein, Shank) have emerged as an important mediator of synaptic remodeling. Synaptic remodeling is a common pathogenic process in various neurological disorders including epilepsy. However, the expression and function of shanks gene in epileptogenesis has not been investigated to date. Herein, we investigated the expression of shanks (shank1/2/3) mRNA expression in both epileptic rats and epilepsy patients. Furthermore, methyl target sequencing was applied to explore the relationship between shank mRNA expression and DNA methylation in both rats and human patients. In general rat model, shank1/2/3 mRNA was downregulated at acute stage, upregulated at latent stage, and returned to the basal level at chronic stage. Ten CpG sites of shank1 was found differentially methylated, out of which 6 were hypermethylated. Seventeen CpG sites of shank3 were differentially methylated, out of which 8 were hypermethylated. In human epilepsy patients, decreased shank2 mRNA was detected from the brain tissue, with DNA hypermethylation dominant from both brain (18 out of 30) and blood tissue (58 out of 80), indicating the regulation role of DNA methylation on shank2 expression. In conclusion, our finding suggests the participation of the shanks gene in the pathophysiology of seizure, out of which 2 shank3 CpG sites (Chr7: 130473419, and Chr7: 130473405) may play an important role in shank3 expression at both the acute and latent stages in the SE rat model."	"Melanoma is a highly invasive malignant skin tumor. While melanoma may share some similarities with that of melanocytic nevi, there also exist a number of distinct differences between these conditions. An analysis of these differences may provide a means to more effectively evaluate the etiology and pathogenesis of melanoma. In particular, differences in aberrant methylation expression may prove to represent a critical distinction. Data from gene expression datasets (GSE3189 and GSE46517) and gene methylation datasets (GSE86355 and GSE120878) were downloaded from the GEO database. GEO2R was used to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylation genes (DMGs). Function and pathway enrichment of selected genes were performed using the DAVID database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING while its visualization was achieved with use of cytoscape. Primary melanoma samples from TCGA were used to identify significant survival genes. There was a total of 199 genes in the hypermethylation-low expression group, while 136 genes in the hypomethylation-high expression group were identified. The former were enriched in the biological processes of transcription regulation, RNA metabolism and regulation of cell proliferation. The later were highly involved in cell cycle regulation. 13 genes were screened out after survival analysis and included: ISG20, DTL, TRPV2, PLOD3, KIF3C, DLGAP4, PI4K2A, WIPI1, SHANK2, SLC16A10, GSTA4O, LFML2A and TMEM47. These findings reveal some of the methylated differentially expressed genes and pathways that exist between melonoma and melanocytic nevi. Moreover, we have identified some critical genes that may help to improve the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma."	"Epithelial cells establish apicobasal polarity by forming tight junctions (TJs) at the apical-lateral boundary, which play fundamental roles in physiological functions. An evolutionarily conserved atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-partitioning defective (PAR) complex functions as a platform for TJ assembly during cell polarity establishment. However, how this complex converts the spatial cues into a subsequent active unit is unclear. Here, we identify an epithelial isoform of Shank2 as a mediator of the aPKC-PAR complex. Shank2 binds to and colocalizes with aPKC at apical junctional regions of polarized epithelial cells. Shank2 knockdown results in defects in TJ formation. Mechanistically, we find that the N-terminal SPN domain is required for the junctional localization of Shank2 and binds to the active form of Rap1 small GTPase, which is involved in TJ formation. Our findings suggest that a close physical and functional relationship between aPKC and Shank2-active Rap1 signaling serves as the platform for TJ assembly to regulate epithelial cell polarity."	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that are highly heterogeneous in clinical symptoms as well as etiologies. Mutations in SHANK2 are associated with ASD and accordingly, Shank2 knockout mouse shows ASD-like behavioral phenotypes, including social deficits. Intriguingly, two lines of Shank2 knockout (KO) mouse generated by deleting different exons (exon 6-7 or exon 7) showed distinct cellular phenotypes. Previously, we compared gene expressions between Shank2 KOs lacking exon 6-7 (e6-7 KO) and KOs lacking exon 7 (e7 KO) by performing RNA-seq. In this study, we expanded transcriptomic analyses to identify novel transcriptional variants in the KO mice. We found prominent expression of a novel exon (exon 4' or e4') between the existing exons 4 and 5 in the Shank2 e6-7 KO model. Expression of the transcriptional variant harboring this novel exon was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blotting. These findings suggest that the novel variant may function as a modifier gene, which contributes to the differences between the two Shank2 mutant lines. Furthermore, our result further represents an example of genetic compensation that may lead to phenotypic heterogeneity among ASD patients with mutations in the same gene."	"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive cancer with one of the highest world incidences in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa. Several genome wide studies have been performed on ESCC cohorts from Asian countries, North America, Malawi and other parts of the world but none have been conducted on ESCC tumors from South Africa to date, where the molecular pathology and etiology of this disease remains unclear. We report here tumor associated copy number changes observed in 51 ESCC patients' samples from the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. We extracted tumor DNA from 51 archived ESCC specimens and interrogated tumor associated DNA copy number changes using Affymetrix® 500 K SNP array technology. The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC 2.0) algorithm was applied to identify significant focal regions of gains and losses. Gains of the top recurrent cancer genes were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and their protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry. Twenty-three significant focal gains were identified across samples. Gains involving the CCND1, MYC, EGFR and JAG1 loci recapitulated those described in studies on Asian and Malawian cohorts. The two most significant gains involved the chromosomal sub-bands 3q28, encompassing the TPRG1 gene and 11q13.3 including the CTTN, PPFIA1and SHANK2 genes. There was no significant homozygous loss and the most recurrent hemizygous deletion involved the B3GAT1 gene on chromosome 11q25. Focal gains on 11q13.3 in 37% of cases (19/51), consistently involved CTTN and SHANK2 genes. Twelve of these cases (23,5%), had a broader region of gain that also included the CCND1, FGF19, FGF4 and FGF3 genes. SHANK2 and CTTN are co-amplified in several cancers, these proteins interact functionally together and are involved in cell motility. Immunohistochemistry confirmed both Shank2 (79%) and cortactin (69%) protein overexpression in samples with gains of these genes. In contrast, cyclin D1 (65%) was moderately expressed in samples with CCND1 DNA gain. This study reports copy number changes in a South African ESCC cohort and highlights similarities and differences with cohorts from Asia and Malawi. Our results strongly suggest a role for CTTN and SHANK2 in the pathogenesis of ESCC in South Africa."
"POGZ"	"autism"	32359026	32345733	32103003	32037394	31782611	"A rare developmental delay (DD)/intellectual disability (ID) syndrome with craniofacial dysmorphisms and autistic features, termed White-Sutton syndrome (WHSUS, MIM#614787), has been recently described, identifying truncating mutations in the chromatin regulator POGZ (KIAA0461, MIM#614787). We describe a further WHSUS patient harboring a novel nonsense de novo POGZ variant, which afflicts a protein domain with transposase activity less frequently impacted by mutational events (DDE domain). This patient displays additional physical and behavioral features, these latter mimicking Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS, MIM#182290). Considering sleep-wake cycle anomalies and abnormal behavior manifested by this boy, we reinforced the clinical resemblance between WHSUS and SMS, being both chromatinopathies. In addition, using the DeepGestalt technology, we identified a different facial overlap between WHSUS patients with mutations in the DDE domain (Group 1) and individuals harboring variants in other protein domains/regions (Group 2). This report further delineates the clinical and molecular repertoire of the POGZ-related phenotype, adding a novel patient with uncommon clinical and behavioral features and provides the first computer-aided facial study of WHSUS patients."	"Determining the genetic basis of speech disorders provides insight into the neurobiology of human communication. Despite intensive investigation over the past 2 decades, the etiology of most speech disorders in children remains unexplained. To test the hypothesis that speech disorders have a genetic etiology, we performed genetic analysis of children with severe speech disorder, specifically childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). Precise phenotyping together with research genome or exome analysis were performed on children referred with a primary diagnosis of CAS. Gene coexpression and gene set enrichment analyses were conducted on high-confidence gene candidates. Thirty-four probands ascertained for CAS were studied. In 11/34 (32%) probands, we identified highly plausible pathogenic single nucleotide (n = 10; CDK13, EBF3, GNAO1, GNB1, DDX3X, MEIS2, POGZ, SETBP1, UPF2, ZNF142) or copy number (n = 1; 5q14.3q21.1 locus) variants in novel genes or loci for CAS. Testing of parental DNA was available for 9 probands and confirmed that the variants had arisen de novo. Eight genes encode proteins critical for regulation of gene transcription, and analyses of transcriptomic data found CAS-implicated genes were highly coexpressed in the developing human brain. We identify the likely genetic etiology in 11 patients with CAS and implicate 9 genes for the first time. We find that CAS is often a sporadic monogenic disorder, and highly genetically heterogeneous. Highly penetrant variants implicate shared pathways in broad transcriptional regulation, highlighting the key role of transcriptional regulation in normal speech development. CAS is a distinctive, socially debilitating clinical disorder, and understanding its molecular basis is the first step towards identifying precision medicine approaches."	"Pogo transposable element derived with ZNF domain (POGZ) has been identified as one of the most recurrently de novo mutated genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and White-Sutton syndrome; however, the neurobiological basis behind these disorders remains unknown. Here, we show that POGZ regulates neuronal development and that ASD-related de novo mutations impair neuronal development in the developing mouse brain and induced pluripotent cell lines from an ASD patient. We also develop the first mouse model heterozygous for a de novo POGZ mutation identified in a patient with ASD, and we identify ASD-like abnormalities in the mice. Importantly, social deficits can be treated by compensatory inhibition of elevated cell excitability in the mice. Our results provide insight into how de novo mutations on high-confidence ASD genes lead to impaired mature cortical network function, which underlies the cellular pathogenesis of NDDs, including ASD."	"This study investigated the diagnostic utility of nontargeted genomic testing in patients with pediatric heart disease. We analyzed genome sequencing data of 111 families with cardiac lesions for rare, disease-associated variation. In 14 families (12.6%), we identified causative variants: seven were de novo (ANKRD11, KMT2D, NR2F2, POGZ, PTPN11, PURA, SALL1) and six were inherited from parents with no or subclinical heart phenotypes (FLT4, DNAH9, MYH11, NEXMIF, NIPBL, PTPN11). Outcome of the testing was associated with the presence of extracardiac features (p = 0.02), but not a positive family history for cardiac lesions (p = 0.67). We also report novel plausible gene-disease associations for tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary stenosis (CDC42BPA, FGD5), hypoplastic left or right heart (SMARCC1, TLN2, TRPM4, VASP), congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (UBXN10), and early-onset cardiomyopathy (TPCN1). The identified candidate genes have critical functions in heart development, such as angiogenesis, mechanotransduction, regulation of heart size, chromatin remodeling, or ciliogenesis. This data set demonstrates the diagnostic and scientific value of genome sequencing in pediatric heart disease, anticipating its role as a first-tier diagnostic test. The genetic heterogeneity will necessitate large-scale genomic initiatives for delineating novel gene-disease associations."	"White-Sutton syndrome (WHSUS) is a recently-identified genetic disorder resulting from de novo heterozygous pathogenic variants in POGZ. Thus far, over 50 individuals have been reported worldwide, however phenotypic characterization and data regarding the natural history are still incomplete. Here we report the clinical features of 22 individuals with 21 unique loss of function POGZ variants. We observed a broad spectrum of intellectual disability and/or developmental delay with or without autism, and speech delay in all individuals. Other common problems included ocular abnormalities, hearing loss and gait abnormalities. A validated sleep disordered breathing questionnaire identified symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea in 4/12 (33%) individuals. A higher-than-expected proportion of cases also had gastrointestinal phenotypes, both functional and anatomical, as well as genitourinary anomalies. In line with previous publications, we observed an increased body mass index (BMI) z-score compared to the general population (mean 0.59, median 0.9; p 0.0253). Common facial features included microcephaly, broad forehead, midface hypoplasia, triangular mouth, broad nasal root and flat nasal bridge. Analysis of the Baylor Genetics clinical laboratory database revealed that POGZ variants were implicated in approximately 0.14% of cases who underwent clinical exome sequencing for neurological indications with or without involvement of other body systems. This study describes a greater allelic series and expands the phenotypic spectrum of this new syndromic form of intellectual disability and autism."
