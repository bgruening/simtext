SCN1A	epilepsy	Epilepsy with auditory features: Contribution of known genes in 112 patients. Epilepsy with Auditory Features (EAF) is a focal epilepsy syndrome mainly of unknown aetiology. LGI1 and RELN have been identified as the main cause of Autosomal Dominant EAF and anecdotally reported in non-familial cases. Pathogenic variants in SCN1A and DEPDC5 have also been described in a few EAF probands belonging to families with heterogeneous phenotypes and incomplete penetrance. We aimed to estimate the contribution of these genes to the disorder by evaluating the largest cohort of EAF. We included 112 unrelated EAF cases (male/female: 52/60) who underwent genetic analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. Thirty-three (29.5%) were familial cases. We identified a genetic diagnosis for 8% of our cohort, including pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (4/8 novel) in LGI1 (2.7%, CI: 0.6-7.6); RELN (1.8%; CI: 0.2-6.3); SCN1A (2.7%; CI: 0.6-7.6) and DEPDC5 (0.9%; CI 0-4.9).This study shows that the contribution of each of the known genes to the overall disorder is limited and that the genetic background of EAF is still largely unknown. Our data emphasize the genetic heterogeneity of EAF and will inform the diagnosis and management of individuals with this disorder.	Allosteric modulation of the cannabinoid 2 receptor confers seizure resistance in mice. Mounting evidence suggests that modulation of cannabinoid 2 receptors (CB2Rs) is therapeutic in mouse models of neurological disorders, including neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative disease, and stroke. We previously showed that reducing CB2R activity increases seizure susceptibility in mice. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the CB2R positive allosteric modulator, Ec21a, against induced seizures in mice. The pharmacokinetic profile of Ec21 demonstrated a similar distribution in brain and plasma, with detection up to 12 hours following injection. Ec21a increased resistance to induced seizures in CF1 wild-type mice and mice harboring the SCN1A R1648H human epilepsy mutation. A rotarod test provided evidence that Ec21a does not cause neurotoxicity-induced motor deficits at its therapeutic dose, and seizure protection was maintained with repeated drug administration. The selectivity of Ec21a for CB2R was supported by the ability of the CB2R antagonist AM630, but not the CB1R antagonist AM251, to block Ec21a-conferred seizure protection in mice, and a lack of significant binding of Ec21a to 34 brain-expressed receptors and transporters in vitro. These results identify allosteric modulation of CB2Rs as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of epilepsy.	Aberrant regulation of a poison exon caused by a non-coding variant in a mouse model of Scn1a-associated epileptic encephalopathy. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that results from mutations in the Nav1.1 sodium channel encoded by SCN1A. Most known DS-causing mutations are in coding regions of SCN1A, but we recently identified several disease-associated SCN1A mutations in intron 20 that are within or near to a cryptic and evolutionarily conserved &quot;poison&quot; exon, 20N, whose inclusion is predicted to lead to transcript degradation. However, it is not clear how these intron 20 variants alter SCN1A expression or DS pathophysiology in an organismal context, nor is it clear how exon 20N is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental context. We address those questions here by generating an animal model of our index case, NM_006920.4(SCN1A):c.3969+2451G&gt;C, using gene editing to create the orthologous mutation in laboratory mice. Scn1a heterozygous knock-in (+/KI) mice exhibited an ~50% reduction in brain Scn1a mRNA and Nav1.1 protein levels, together with characteristics observed in other DS mouse models, including premature mortality, seizures, and hyperactivity. In brain tissue from adult Scn1a +/+ animals, quantitative RT-PCR assays indicated that ~1% of Scn1a mRNA included exon 20N, while brain tissue from Scn1a +/KI mice exhibited an ~5-fold increase in the extent of exon 20N inclusion. We investigated the extent of exon 20N inclusion in brain during normal fetal development in RNA-seq data and discovered that levels of inclusion were ~70% at E14.5, declining progressively to ~10% postnatally. A similar pattern exists for the homologous sodium channel Nav1.6, encoded by Scn8a. For both genes, there is an inverse relationship between the level of functional transcript and the extent of poison exon inclusion. Taken together, our findings suggest that poison exon usage by Scn1a and Scn8a is a strategy to regulate channel expression during normal brain development, and that mutations recapitulating a fetal-like pattern of splicing cause reduced channel expression and epileptic encephalopathy.	The dose makes the poison-Novel insights into Dravet syndrome and SCN1A regulation through nonproductive splicing. NA	Pathogenic variant in the PCDH19 gene in a patient with epilepsy and cognitive disability. The association of family cases of epilepsy and intellectual disability in women was reported in 1971. In 2008, the role of pathogenic variants of the PCDH19 gene in some families were identified. The disease presents with febrile seizure clusters, intellectual disability, and autistic features. Most cases are due to de novo variants, however, there are some inherited cases, with an atypical way of X-linked transmission. To report the case of a patient with epilepsy carrier of a pathogenic variant of the PCDH19 gene, reviewing the natural history of this condition and the available evidence for its management. Female patient, with normal history of pregnancy and perinatal period. At 6 months, while febrile, she presented focal motor seizure clusters that repeated at 14, 18, 21 months and 3 years old, always associated with fever, even presenting status epilepticus. She is on therapy with topiramate and valproic acid, achieving 13 seizure-free years. The analysis of the SCN1A gene showed no abnormalities and the study of the PCDH19 gene revealed a de novo heterozygous pathogenic variant. The patient evolved with intellectual disability and severe behavioral disorders that require mental health team support. PCDH19 pathogenic variants have varied phenotypic expression. The genetic diagnosis should be guided with the clinical features. Long-term psychiatric morbidity can be disabling.
SCN9A	epilepsy	Satellite Glial Cells Give Rise to Nociceptive Sensory Neurons. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons can transmit information about noxious stimulus to cerebral cortex via spinal cord, and play an important role in the pain pathway. Alterations of the pain pathway lead to CIPA (congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis) or chronic pain. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that nerve damage leads to the regeneration of neurons in DRG, which may contribute to pain modulation in feedback. Therefore, exploring the regeneration process of DRG neurons would provide a new understanding to the persistent pathological stimulation and contribute to reshape the somatosensory function. It has been reported that a subpopulation of satellite glial cells (SGCs) express Nestin and p75, and could differentiate into glial cells and neurons, suggesting that SGCs may have differentiation plasticity. Our results in the present study show that DRG-derived SGCs (DRG-SGCs) highly express neural crest cell markers Nestin, Sox2, Sox10, and p75, and differentiate into nociceptive sensory neurons in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA, Wnt pathway activator CHIR99021, Notch pathway inhibitor RO4929097, and FGF pathway inhibitor SU5402. The nociceptive sensory neurons express multiple functionally-related genes (SCN9A, SCN10A, SP, Trpv1, and TrpA1) and are able to generate action potentials and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents. Moreover, we found that these cells exhibited rapid calcium transients in response to capsaicin through binding to the Trpv1 vanilloid receptor, confirming that the DRG-SGC-derived cells are nociceptive sensory neurons. Further, we show that Wnt signaling promotes the differentiation of DRG-SGCs into nociceptive sensory neurons by regulating the expression of specific transcription factor Runx1, while Notch and FGF signaling pathways are involved in the expression of SCN9A. These results demonstrate that DRG-SGCs have stem cell characteristics and can efficiently differentiate into functional nociceptive sensory neurons, shedding light on the clinical treatment of sensory neuron-related diseases.	High genetic burden in 163 Chinese children with status epilepticus. This study aimed to investigate the genetic aetiology in Chinese children diagnosed with status epilepticus (SE). Next-generation sequencing, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, and other genetic testing methods were conducted for children with SE lacking an identifiable non-genetic aetiology. Furthermore, the phenotype and molecular data of patients with SE were retrospectively analysed. Among children with SE lacking an identifiable non-genetic aetiology, 73 out of 163 children (44.8 %) were found to have causative variants associated with SE including 66 monogenic mutations in 22 genes and 7 CNVs. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics scoring system, the monogenic variants included 64 pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 2 uncertain significance variants. SCN1A gene mutations (n = 32) were the most common cause, followed by TSC2 (n = 5), CACNA1A (n = 5), SCN2A (n = 4), SCN9A (n = 2) and DEPDC5 (n = 2) gene mutations. Sixteen mutations were identified in single genes. Furthermore, 51 (77.3 %) monogenic mutations were de novo. Age at SE onset &lt; 1 year (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-5.83, p = 0.012) and co-morbidity of intellectual disability (OR = 3.36, 95 %CI: 1.61-6.99, p = 0.001) were independently associated with pathogenic genetic variants. This study identified genetic aetiology in 44.8 % of patients with SE, which indicates a high burden of genetic aetiology among children with SE in China. Our findings highlight the importance for genetic testing of children with SE that lacks an identifiable non-genetic aetiology.	Correlation of genetic alterations by whole-exome sequencing with clinical outcomes of glioblastoma patients from the Lebanese population. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor associated with high degree of resistance to treatment. Given its heterogeneity, it is important to understand the molecular landscape of this tumor for the development of more effective therapies. Because of the different genetic profiles of patients with GBM, we sought to identify genetic variants in Lebanese patients with GBM (LEB-GBM) and compare our findings to those in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify somatic variants in a cohort of 60 patient-derived GBM samples. We focused our analysis on 50 commonly mutated GBM candidate genes and compared mutation signatures between our population and publicly available GBM data from TCGA. We also cross-tabulated biological covariates to assess for associations with overall survival, time to recurrence and follow-up duration. We included 60 patient-derived GBM samples from 37 males and 23 females, with age ranging from 3 to 80 years (mean and median age at diagnosis were 51 and 56, respectively). Recurrent tumor formation was present in 94.8% of patients (n = 55/58). After filtering, we identified 360 somatic variants from 60 GBM patient samples. After filtering, we identified 360 somatic variants from 60 GBM patient samples. Most frequently mutated genes in our samples included ATRX, PCDHX11, PTEN, TP53, NF1, EGFR, PIK3CA, and SCN9A. Mutations in NLRP5 were associated with decreased overall survival among the Lebanese GBM cohort (p = 0.002). Mutations in NLRP5 were associated with decreased overall survival among the Lebanese GBM cohort (p = 0.002). EGFR and NF1 mutations were associated with the frontal lobe and temporal lobe in our LEB-GBM cohort, respectively. Our WES analysis confirmed the similarity in mutation signature of the LEB-GBM population with TCGA cohorts. It showed that 1 out of the 50 commonly GBM candidate gene mutations is associated with decreased overall survival among the Lebanese cohort. This study also highlights the need for studies with larger sample sizes to inform clinicians for better prognostication and management of Lebanese patients with GBM.	No association between SCN9A and monogenic human epilepsy disorders. Many studies have demonstrated the clinical utility and importance of epilepsy gene panel testing to confirm the specific aetiology of disease, enable appropriate therapeutic interventions, and inform accurate family counselling. Previously, SCN9A gene variants, in particular a c.1921A&gt;T p.(Asn641Tyr) substitution, have been identified as a likely autosomal dominant cause of febrile seizures/febrile seizures plus and other monogenic seizure phenotypes indistinguishable from those associated with SCN1A, leading to inclusion of SCN9A on epilepsy gene testing panels. Here we present serendipitous findings of genetic studies that identify the SCN9A c.1921A&gt;T p.(Asn641Tyr) variant at high frequency in the Amish community in the absence of such seizure phenotypes. Together with findings in UK Biobank these data refute an association of SCN9A with epilepsy, which has important clinical diagnostic implications.	Two for the Price of One: Heterobivalent Ligand Design Targeting Two Binding Sites on Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Slows Ligand Dissociation and Enhances Potency. Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels are pore-forming transmembrane proteins that play essential roles in excitable cells, and they are key targets for antiepileptic, antiarrhythmic, and analgesic drugs. We implemented a heterobivalent design strategy to modulate the potency, selectivity, and binding kinetics of NaV channel ligands. We conjugated μ-conotoxin KIIIA, which occludes the pore of the NaV channels, to an analogue of huwentoxin-IV, a spider-venom peptide that allosterically modulates channel gating. Bioorthogonal hydrazide and copper-assisted azide-alkyne cycloaddition conjugation chemistries were employed to generate heterobivalent ligands using polyethylene glycol linkers spanning 40-120 Å. The ligand with an 80 Å linker had the most pronounced bivalent effects, with a significantly slower dissociation rate and 4-24-fold higher potency compared to those of the monovalent peptides for the human NaV1.4 channel. This study highlights the power of heterobivalent ligand design and expands the repertoire of pharmacological probes for exploring the function of NaV channels.
GRIN2A	epilepsy	Voltage-independent GluN2A-type NMDA receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling promotes audiogenic seizures, attentional and cognitive deficits in mice. The NMDA receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic activity is critically involved in synaptic plasticity and thus has a key role in the nervous system. In GRIN2-variant patients alterations of this coincidence detection provoked complex clinical phenotypes, ranging from reduced muscle strength to epileptic seizures and intellectual disability. By using our gene-targeted mouse line (Grin2a<sup>N615S</sup>), we show that voltage-independent glutamate-gated signaling of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors is associated with NMDAR-dependent audiogenic seizures due to hyperexcitable midbrain circuits. In contrast, the NMDAR antagonist MK-801-induced c-Fos expression is reduced in the hippocampus. Likewise, the synchronization of theta- and gamma oscillatory activity is lowered during exploration, demonstrating reduced hippocampal activity. This is associated with exploratory hyperactivity and aberrantly increased and dysregulated levels of attention that can interfere with associative learning, in particular when relevant cues and reward outcomes are disconnected in space and time. Together, our findings provide (i) experimental evidence that the inherent voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling of NMDA receptors is essential for maintaining appropriate responses to sensory stimuli and (ii) a mechanistic explanation for the neurological manifestations seen in the NMDAR-related human disorders with GRIN2 variant-meidiated intellectual disability and focal epilepsy.	Treatment response to low-dose ketamine infusion for treatment-resistant depression: A gene-based genome-wide association study. Evidence suggested the crucial roles of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glutamate system functioning in the antidepressant mechanisms of low-dose ketamine infusion in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). 65 patients with TRD were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Twelve ketamine-related genes were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion and the resulting serum ketamine and norketamine levels. Specific SNPs and whole genes involved in BDNF-TrkB signaling (i.e., rs2049048 in BDNF and rs10217777 in NTRK2) and the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems (i.e., rs16966731 in GRIN2A) were associated with the rapid (within 240 min) and persistent (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine infusion and with serum ketamine and norketamine levels. Our findings confirmed the predictive roles of BDNF-TrkB signaling and glutamatergic and GABAergic systems in the underlying mechanisms of low-dose ketamine infusion for TRD treatment.	Epigenetic-mediated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor changes in the brain of isolated reared rats. Aim: We investigated: Grin1, Grin2a, Grin2b DNA methylation; NR1 and NR2 mRNA/protein in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); and hippocampus of male Wistar rats exposed to isolation rearing. Materials &amp; methods: Animals were kept isolated or grouped (n = 10/group) from weaning for 10 weeks. Tissues were dissected for RNA/DNA extraction and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, ELISA and pyrosequencing. Results: Isolated-reared animals had: decreased mRNA in PFC for all markers, increased NR1 protein in hippocampus and hypermethylation of Grin1 in PFC and Grin2b in hippocampus, compared with grouped rats. Associations between mRNA/protein and DNA methylation were found for both brain areas. Conclusion: This study indicates that epigenetic DNA methylation may underlie N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mRNA/protein expression alterations caused by isolation rearing.	Clinical Forms and GRIN2A Genotype of Severe End of Epileptic-Aphasia Spectrum Disorder. Objective: This study aims to analyze the electroclinical characteristics and gene test results of children on the severe end of the epilepsy aphasia spectrum (EAS) and also the correlation of EAS-related GRIN2A genes to explore the genotype-phenotype relationships, as well as potential pathogenic mechanism of EAS. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on the participants diagnosed with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (CSWS), and atypical benign partial epilepsy (ABPE) at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2013 to June 2019. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in six patients, and epileptic panel was carried out in two. In addition, we reviewed all the published literatures reporting EAS patients with pathogenic variants until June 2019 and conducted Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, as well as protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results: The mean age at seizure onset was 55.4 ± 27.0 months. The baseline severity of the spike-wave index (SWI) was not significantly correlated with intellectual disability (ID) level. Two pathogenic de novo GRIN2A null variants were identified in patients with ABPE who had less severe ID, despite the electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES). By literature reviewing, 18 GRIN2A missense mutations and 11 GRIN2A truncating mutations which lead to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors' loss of function has been reported. Of these mutations, 9 (31.0%) are situated in amino (N)-terminal domain, 6 (20.7%) in linger-binding domain S1, and 10 (34.5%) in linger-binding domain S2. EAS-related genes were enriched in the biological process of chemical synaptic transmission and vocalization (FDR, &lt;0.01). The hub protein in PPI network is GluN2A, which might affect language function via foxp2-srpx2/uPAR signal network. Conclusion: Our data suggested that when children suspected with benign epilepsy of children with centrotemporal spikes (BECTs) have early-onset age, changed seizure semiology, and deterioration of behavior/cognition/motor function, neurologists should be alert of the appearance of ESES. The neuropsychological deterioration in children with EAS might not only be completely affected by electric discharge severity but also genetic etiology. Our finding also enforced the current genotype-phenotype relationship theory about EAS. For EAS children, GRIN2A-FOXP2-SRPX2/uPAR signal network might contribute to the mechanism of their language deficit.	Exploratory study of selected nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B encoding subunits of the NMDA receptor in a targeted group of schizophrenia patients with chronic cognitive impairment. Schizophrenia is a mental disease that affects approximately 1% of the population. Despite over 100 years of research, its pathomechanism has still not been clarified. Cognitive deficits, which are one of the symptomatic dimensions of schizophrenia, usually appear a few years before the first psychotic episode. Therefore, this is why they are probably the clinical manifestation of the primary pathomechanism of schizophrenia. It is also supposed that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) insufficiency in the prefrontal cortex is responsible for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The study aimed to examine whether four selected single nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B encoding NMDA-R subunits, of which two have not been tested before, are linked with the selected clinical phenotype of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. The study included the targeted group of 117 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, all with cognitive deficits and in symptomatic remission. DNA fragments including the studied polymorphisms of the NMDA receptors subunit genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subjected to sequencing. The study did not confirm the presence of any of the four selected single nucleotide variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B subunits of NMDA-R. The finding indicates that selected single nucleotide variants in GRIN2A and GRIN2B encoding subunits of the NMDA receptor are not associated with the presence of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
ANKRD11	autism	Two loss-of-function ANKRD11 variants in Chinese patients with short stature and a possible molecular pathway. KBG syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and intellectual disability. Heterozygous mutations in ANKRD11 gene, or deletion of 16q24.3 that includes ANKRD11 gene are the cause of KBG syndrome. We describe two patients presenting with short stature and partial facial features, whereas no intellectual disability or hearing loss was observed in them. Two ANKRD11 variants, c.4039_4041del (p. Lys1347del) and c.6427C &gt; G (p. Leu2143Val), were identified in this study. Both of them were classified as variants of uncertain significance (VOUS) by ACMG/AMP guidelines and were inherited from their mothers. ANKRD11 could enhance the transactivation of p21 gene, which was identified to participate in chondrogenic differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that the knockdown of ANKRD11 could reduce the p21-promoter luciferase activities while re-introduction of wild type ANKRD11, but not ANKRD11 variants (p. Lys1347del or p. Leu2143Val), could restore the p21 levels. Thus, our study report two loss-of-function ANKRD11 variants which might provide new insight on pathogenic mechanism that correlates ANKRD11 variants with the short stature phenotype of KBG syndrome.	Two Novel Mutations of ANKRD11 Gene and Wide Clinical Spectrum in KBG Syndrome: Case Reports and Literature Review. KBG syndrome (OMIM #148050) is a rare, autosomal dominant inherited genetic disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) gene or by microdeletion of chromosome 16q24.3. It is characterized by macrodontia of the upper central incisors, distinctive facial dysmorphism, short stature, vertebral abnormalities, hand anomaly including clinodactyly, and various degrees of developmental delay. KBG syndrome presents with variable clinical feature and severity among individuals. Here, we report two KBG patients who have different novel heterozygous mutations of ANKRD11 gene with wide range of clinical manifestations. Two novel heterozygous mutations of ANKRD11 gene were identified in two unrelated Korean patients with variable clinical presentations. The first patient presented with short stature and early puberty and was treated with growth hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist without adverse effects. He had mild intellectual disability. In targeted exome sequencing, a novel de novo frameshift variant was identified in ANKRD11, c.5889del, and p. (Ile1963MetfsX9). The second patient had severe intellectual disability with epilepsy. He had normal height and prepubertal stage at the age of 11 years. He had behavioral problems such as autism-like features, anxiety, and stereotypical movements. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed, and the novel heterozygous mutation, c3310dup, p. (Glu110GlyfsTer5) in ANKRD11 was identified. KBG syndrome is often underdiagnosed because of its non-specific features and phenotypic variability. Performing a next-generation sequencing panel, including the ANKRD11 gene for cases of developmental delay with/without short stature may be helpful to identify hitherto undiagnosed KBG syndrome patients.	Description of neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with 10 genetic neurodevelopmental disorders: A scoping review. Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions including intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Advances in genetic diagnostic technology have led to the identification of a number of NDD-associated genes, but reports of cognitive and developmental outcomes in affected individuals have been variable. The objective of this scoping review is to synthesize available information pertaining to the developmental outcomes of individuals with pathogenic variants in ten emerging recurrent NDD-associated genes identified from large scale sequencing studies; ADNP, ANKRD11, ARID1B, CHD2, CHD8, CTNNB1, DDX3X, DYRK1A, SCN2A, and SYNGAP1. After a comprehensive search, 260 articles were selected that reported on neurodevelopmental measures or diagnoses. We identify the spectrum of developmental outcomes for each genetic NDD, including prevalence of intellectual disability, frequency of co-morbid NDDs such as ADHD and autism, and commonly reported medical issues that can help inform diagnosis and treatment. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the natural history of these conditions. Future research focusing on barriers to assessment, the development of modified assessment tools appropriate for long-term outcomes in genetic NDD, and collection of longitudinal data will increase understanding of prognosis in these conditions and inform evaluations of treatment.	A woman with a dual genetic diagnosis of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease and KBG syndrome. We present a female patient with a dual genetic diagnosis of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease and KBG syndrome. The proband was an 18-year-old woman presenting with intellectual disability, renal insufficiency, and hyperuricemia. Abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal any abnormalities. The patient's father had been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and hyperuricemia in his twenties; however, he had no intellectual disability. Her mother and two younger siblings were not affected. Next generation sequencing (NGS) identified mutations in UMOD (c.796T &gt; C) of the proband and her father, and in ANKRD11 (c.1903_1907del) of the proband. Renal insufficiency and intellectual disability were attributed to mutations in UMOD and ANRKD11, respectively. When making genetic diagnoses, the presence of multiple mutations in an individual should be considered, particularly when not all symptoms could be attributed to a single disease. The number of patients with dual genetic diagnosis is expected to increase as NGS becomes more readily available; thus, making it necessary to undertake a careful and robust assessment of the clinical symptoms and the related genotypes, to ensure an accurate diagnosis.	[Analysis of ANKRD11 gene variant in a family affected with KBG syndrome]. To explore the genetic basis for a pedigree affected with KBG syndrome. Clinical data of three patients from the pedigree (the proband, his mother and sister) was collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). Suspected variant was verified by Sanger sequencing. The proband was found to harbor a heterozygous c.4398_4401del (p.Glu1467AsnfsTer63) frameshift variant of the ANKRD11 gene by WES. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the same variant was also present in his mother and sister, but not in his father. The c.4398_4401de (p.Glu1467AsnfsTer63) variation of the ANKRD11 gene probably underlies the KBG syndrome in this pedigree.
SHANK2	autism	The Temple Grandin Genome: Comprehensive Analysis in a Scientist with High-Functioning Autism. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition with a complex genetic etiology. The objective of this study is to identify the complex genetic factors that underlie the ASD phenotype and other clinical features of Professor Temple Grandin, an animal scientist and woman with high-functioning ASD. Identifying the underlying genetic cause for ASD can impact medical management, personalize services and treatment, and uncover other medical risks that are associated with the genetic diagnosis. Prof. Grandin underwent chromosomal microarray analysis, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing, as well as a comprehensive clinical and family history intake. The raw data were analyzed in order to identify possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Genetic testing identified variants in three genes (SHANK2, ALX1, and RELN) that are candidate risk factors for ASD. We identified variants in MEFV and WNT10A, reported to be disease-associated in previous studies, which are likely to contribute to some of her additional clinical features. Moreover, candidate variants in genes encoding metabolic enzymes and transporters were identified, some of which suggest potential therapies. This case report describes the genomic findings in Prof. Grandin and it serves as an example to discuss state-of-the-art clinical diagnostics for individuals with ASD, as well as the medical, logistical, and economic hurdles that are involved in clinical genetic testing for an individual on the autism spectrum.	Learning and reaction times in mouse touchscreen tests are differentially impacted by mutations in genes encoding postsynaptic interacting proteins SYNGAP1, NLGN3, DLGAP1, DLGAP2 and SHANK2. The postsynaptic terminal of vertebrate excitatory synapses contains a highly conserved multiprotein complex that comprises neurotransmitter receptors, cell-adhesion molecules, scaffold proteins and enzymes, which are essential for brain signalling and plasticity underlying behaviour. Increasingly, mutations in genes that encode postsynaptic proteins belonging to the PSD-95 protein complex, continue to be identified in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and epilepsy. These disorders are highly heterogeneous, sharing genetic aetiology and comorbid cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Here, by using genetically engineered mice and innovative touchscreen-based cognitive testing, we sought to investigate whether loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding key interactors of the PSD-95 protein complex display shared phenotypes in associative learning, updating of learned associations and reaction times. Our genetic dissection of mice with loss-of-function mutations in Syngap1, Nlgn3, Dlgap1, Dlgap2 and Shank2 showed that distinct components of the PSD-95 protein complex differentially regulate learning, cognitive flexibility and reaction times in cognitive processing. These data provide insights for understanding how human mutations in these genes lead to the manifestation of diverse and complex phenotypes in NDDs.	Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of cognitive function in middle and old-aged Chinese monozygotic twins. Cognitive ability plays an important role in mental and physical well-beings in the increasingly ageing populations. Here, based on a sample of 30 cognitive function-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, we aimed to detect specific epigenetic variants potentially related to cognitive function by conducting an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). Association between methylation level of single CpG site with cognitive function score was tested by linear mixed effect model. Functions of cis-regulatory regions and ontology enrichments were predicted by Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected by comb-p python library. A list of 28 CpG sites were identified to reach the level of P &lt; 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, and the strongest association (cor = 0.138, P = 2.549 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) was detected for DNA CpG site (Chr17: 40,700,490 bp) located at HSD17B1P1. The identified 14,065 genomic CpG sites (P &lt; 0.05) were mapped to 2646 genes, especially HSD17B1P1, CUL4A, INTS8, GFI1B, ZNF467, CDH15, and PSMA1. GREAT ontology enrichments mainly highlighted nicotine pharmacodynamics pathway, GABA-B receptor II/nicotinic acetylcholine receptor/hedgehog/endothelin/Wnt signaling pathways, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, glycolysis, neuronal system, and toll-like receptor binding. We detected 15 DMRs located at/near 16 genes, especially LINC01551, LINC02282, and FAM32A. And 32 cognitive function-associated differentially methylated genes could be replicated, such as SHANK2, ABCA2, PRDM16, NCOR2, and INPP5A. Our EWAS in monozygotic twins identify specific epigenetic variations which are significantly involved in functional genes, biological function and pathways that mediate cognitive function. The findings provide clues to further identify new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cognitive dysfunction.	Differentially altered social dominance- and cooperative-like behaviors in Shank2- and Shank3-mutant mice. Recent progress in genomics has contributed to the identification of a large number of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, many of which encode synaptic proteins. Our understanding of ASDs has advanced rapidly, partly owing to the development of numerous animal models. Extensive characterizations using a variety of behavioral batteries that analyze social behaviors have shown that a subset of engineered mice that model mutations in genes encoding Shanks, a family of excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, exhibit autism-like behaviors. Although these behavioral assays have been useful in identifying deficits in simple social behaviors, alterations in complex social behaviors remain largely untested. Two syndromic ASD mouse models-Shank2 constitutive knockout [KO] mice and Shank3 constitutive KO mice-were examined for alterations in social dominance and social cooperative behaviors using tube tests and automated cooperation tests. Upon naïve and salient behavioral experience, expression levels of c-Fos were analyzed as a proxy for neural activity across diverse brain areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a number of subcortical structures. As previously reported, Shank2 KO mice showed deficits in sociability, with intact social recognition memory, whereas Shank3 KO mice displayed no overt phenotypes. Strikingly, the two Shank KO mouse models exhibited diametrically opposed alterations in social dominance and cooperative behaviors. After a specific social behavioral experience, Shank mutant mice exhibited distinct changes in number of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> neurons in the number of cortical and subcortical brain regions. Our results underscore the heterogeneity of social behavioral alterations in different ASD mouse models and highlight the utility of testing complex social behaviors in validating neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorder models. In addition, neural activities at distinct brain regions are likely collectively involved in eliciting complex social behaviors, which are differentially altered in ASD mouse models.	Neonatal Sevoflurane Exposure Impairs Learning and Memory by the Hypermethylation of Hippocampal Synaptic Genes. Sevoflurane anesthesia is widely used in pediatric patients. Clinical studies report memory impairment in those exposed to general anesthesia early in life. DNA methylation is essential for the modulation of synaptic plasticity through regulating the transcription of synaptic genes. Therefore, we tested whether neonatal sevoflurane exposure affects learning and memory underlying the hippocampal DNA methylation of synaptic genes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane or air for 2 h daily from postnatal day 7 (P7) to P9. 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), was intraperitoneally injected 30 min before sevoflurane or air exposure on P7-9. The rats were euthanized 6, 12, 24 h, and 28 days after the last sevoflurane exposure, followed by the determination of global and gene-specific DNA methylation. The expression of synaptic proteins and synaptic density and the transcription of Dnmts and ten eleven translocations (Tets) in the hippocampus were measured. The ability of learning and memory was assessed using Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and intruder tests. Repeated neonatal sevoflurane exposure impaired cognitive, social, and spatial memory. The memory impairment was associated with the increased Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and 5-methylcytosine level and the decreased Tet1 and 5-hydromethylcytosine level. Sevoflurane subsequently induced hypermethylation of Shank2, Psd95, Syn1, and Syp gene and down-regulated the expression of synaptic proteins, which finally led to the decrease of synaptic density in a time-dependent manner. Notably, 5-AZA pretreatment ameliorated learning and memory in sevoflurane-treated rats. In conclusion, neonatal exposure to sevoflurane can impair learning and memory through DNA methylation of synaptic genes.
POGZ	autism	A case of White-Sutton syndrome with previously described loss-of-function variant in DDE domain of POGZ (p.Arg1211*) and Kartagener syndrome. NA	Widespread labeling and genomic editing of the fetal central nervous system by in utero CRISRP AAV9-PHP.eB administration. Efficient genetic manipulation in the developing central nervous system is critical to investigate mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders and develop promising therapeutics. Common approaches including transgenic mice and in utero electroporation (IUE), although powerful in many aspects, have their own limitations. In this study, we delivered vectors based on the AAV9.PHP.eB pseudo-type to the fetal mouse brain and achieved widespread and extensive transduction of neural cells. When AAV9.PHP.eB coding gRNA targeting PogZ or Depdc5 was delivered to Cas9 transgenic mice, widespread gene knockout was also achieved at the whole brain level. Our studies provide a useful platform for studying brain development and devising genetic intervention for severe developmental diseases.	Neuropsychological study in 19 French patients with White-Sutton syndrome and POGZ mutations. White-Sutton syndrome is a rare developmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disabilities (ID), and neurobehavioral abnormalities secondary to pathogenic pogo transposable element-derived protein with zinc finger domain (POGZ) variants. The purpose of our study was to describe the neurocognitive phenotype of an unbiased national cohort of patients with identified POGZ pathogenic variants. This study is based on a French collaboration through the AnDDI-Rares network, and includes 19 patients from 18 families with POGZ pathogenic variants. All clinical data and neuropsychological tests were collected from medical files. Among the 19 patients, 14 patients exhibited ID (six mild, five moderate and three severe). The five remaining patients had learning disabilities and shared a similar neurocognitive profile, including language difficulties, dysexecutive syndrome, attention disorders, slowness, and social difficulties. One patient evaluated for autism was found to have moderate autism spectrum disorder. This study reveals that the cognitive phenotype of patients with POGZ pathogenic variants can range from learning disabilities to severe ID. It highlights that pathogenic variations in the same genes can be reported in a large spectrum of neurocognitive profiles, and that children with learning disabilities could benefit from next generation sequencing techniques.	Pogz deficiency leads to transcription dysregulation and impaired cerebellar activity underlying autism-like behavior in mice. Several genes implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are chromatin regulators, including POGZ. The cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to ASD impaired social and cognitive behavior are unclear. Animal models are crucial for studying the effects of mutations on brain function and behavior as well as unveiling the underlying mechanisms. Here, we generate a brain specific conditional knockout mouse model deficient for Pogz, an ASD risk gene. We demonstrate that Pogz deficient mice show microcephaly, growth impairment, increased sociability, learning and motor deficits, mimicking several of the human symptoms. At the molecular level, luciferase reporter assay indicates that POGZ is a negative regulator of transcription. In accordance, in Pogz deficient mice we find a significant upregulation of gene expression, most notably in the cerebellum. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the transcriptional changes encompass genes and pathways disrupted in ASD, including neurogenesis and synaptic processes, underlying the observed behavioral phenotype in mice. Physiologically, Pogz deficiency is associated with a reduction in the firing frequency of simple and complex spikes and an increase in amplitude of the inhibitory synaptic input in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Our findings support a mechanism linking heterochromatin dysregulation to cerebellar circuit dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities in ASD.	Altered hippocampal-prefrontal communication during anxiety-related avoidance in mice deficient for the autism-associated gene Pogz. Many genes have been linked to autism. However, it remains unclear what long-term changes in neural circuitry result from disruptions in these genes, and how these circuit changes might contribute to abnormal behaviors. To address these questions, we studied behavior and physiology in mice heterozygous for Pogz, a high confidence autism gene. Pogz<sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibit reduced anxiety-related avoidance in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Theta-frequency communication between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be necessary for normal avoidance in the EPM. We found deficient theta-frequency synchronization between the vHPC and mPFC in vivo. When we examined vHPC-mPFC communication at higher resolution, vHPC input onto prefrontal GABAergic interneurons was specifically disrupted, whereas input onto pyramidal neurons remained intact. These findings illustrate how the loss of a high confidence autism gene can impair long-range communication by causing inhibitory circuit dysfunction within pathways important for specific behaviors.
