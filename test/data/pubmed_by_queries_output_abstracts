"SCN1A"	"epilepsy"	"Modulation of GABAergic dysfunction due to SCN1A mutation linked to Hippocampal Sclerosis. We compared GABAergic function and neuronal excitability in the hippocampal tissue of seven sporadic MTLE patients with a patient carrying a SCN1A loss-of-function mutation. All had excellent outcome from anterior temporal lobectomy, and neuropathological study always showed characteristic hippocampal sclerosis (Hs). Compared to MTLE patients, there was a more severe impairment of GABAergic transmission, due to the lower GABAergic activity related to the NaV 1.1 loss-of-function, in addition to the typical GABA-current rundown, a hallmark of sporadic MTLE. Our results give evidence that a pharmacological rescuing of the GABAergic dysfunction may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of these patients."	"Next Generation Sequencing of 134 Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Regression. Approximately 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience developmental regression, the etiology of which remains largely unknown. We performed a complete literature search and identified 47 genes that had been implicated in such cases. We sequenced these genes in a preselected cohort of 134 individuals with regressive autism. In total, 16 variants in 12 genes with evidence supportive of pathogenicity were identified. They were classified as variants of uncertain significance based on ACMG standards and guidelines. Among these were recurring variants in GRIN2A and PLXNB2, variants in genes that were linked to syndromic forms of ASD (GRIN2A, MECP2, CDKL5, SCN1A,PCDH19, UBE3A, and SLC9A6), and variants in the form of oligogenic heterozygosity (EHMT1, SLC9A6, and MFSD8)."	"Inter-Regulation of Kv4.3 and Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Underlies Predisposition to Cardiac and Neuronal Channelopathies. Genetic variants in voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) encoded by SCNXA genes, responsible for INa, and Kv4.3 channels encoded by KCND3, responsible for the transient outward current (Ito), contribute to the manifestation of both Brugada syndrome (BrS) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA19/22). We examined the hypothesis that Kv4.3 and Nav variants regulate each other's function, thus modulating INa/Ito balance in cardiomyocytes and INa/I(A) balance in neurons. Bicistronic and other constructs were used to express WT or variant Nav1.5 and Kv4.3 channels in HEK293 cells. INa and Ito were recorded. SCN5A variants associated with BrS reduced INa, but increased Ito. Moreover, BrS and SCA19/22 KCND3 variants associated with a gain of function of Ito, significantly reduced INa, whereas the SCA19/22 KCND3 variants associated with a loss of function (LOF) of Ito significantly increased INa. Auxiliary subunits Navβ1, MiRP3 and KChIP2 also modulated INa/Ito balance. Co-immunoprecipitation and Duolink studies suggested that the two channels interact within the intracellular compartments and biotinylation showed that LOF SCN5A variants can increase Kv4.3 cell-surface expression. Nav and Kv4.3 channels modulate each other's function via trafficking and gating mechanisms, which have important implications for improved understanding of these allelic cardiac and neuronal syndromes."	"Molecular diagnosis of epileptic encephalopathy of the first year of life applying a customized gene panel in a group of Argentinean patients. The aim of this study was to perform a molecular characterization of 17 Argentinean pediatric patients with diagnosis of having epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) of the first year of life without known etiology, applying next-generation sequencing (NGS). We included 17 patients with EE with age of onset under 12 months without known etiology after ruling out structural abnormalities, metabolic disorders, and large chromosomal abnormalities. They presented with the following clinical phenotypes: Dravet syndrome (DS; n: 7), epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS; n: 3), West syndrome (WS; n: 2), and undetermined epileptic encephalopathy (UEE; n: 5). Neurologic examinations, seizure semiology, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and standard electroencephalography (EEG) or video-EEG studies were performed in all cases. Using a custom amplicon strategy, we designed an NGS panel to study 47 genes associated with EEs. Pathogenic variants were detected in 8 cases (47%), including seven novel pathogenic variants and one previously reported as being pathogenic. The pathogenic variants were identified in 6 patients with DS (SCN1A gene), one with EIMFS (SCN2A gene), and one with UEE (SLC2A1 gene). Nonrelevant variants were identified in the patients with WS. We demonstrated the feasibility of an NGS-gene panel approach for the analysis of patients with EE in our setting. A genetic diagnosis was achieved in nearly 50% of patients, 87% of them presenting with nonpreviously reported variants. The early identification of the underlying causative genetic alteration will be a valuable tool for providing prognostic information and genetic counselling and also to improve therapeutic decisions in Argentinean patients."

"SCN9A"	"epilepsy"	"Genomic analysis of 21 patients with corneal neuralgia after refractive surgery. Refractive surgery, specifically laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis and photorefractive keratectomy, are widely applied procedures to treat myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. After surgery, a subgroup of cases suffers from persistent and intractable pain of obscure etiology, thought to be neuropathic. We aimed to investigate the contribution of genomic factors in the pathogenesis of these patients with corneal neuralgia. We enrolled 21 cases (6 males and 15 females) from 20 unrelated families, who reported persistent pain (&gt;3 months), after refractive surgery (20 laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis and 1 photorefractive keratectomy patients). Whole-exome sequencing and gene-based association test were performed. Whole-exome sequencing demonstrated low-frequency variants (allele frequency &lt; 0.05) in electrogenisome-related ion channels and cornea-expressed collagens, most frequently in SCN10A (5 cases), SCN9A (4 cases), TRPV1 (4 cases), CACNA1H and CACNA2D2 (5 cases each), COL5A1 (6 cases), COL6A3 (5 cases), and COL4A2 (4 cases). Two variants, p.K655R of SCN9A and p.Q85R of TRPV1, were previously characterized as gain-of-function. Gene-based association test assessing &quot;damaging&quot; missense variants against gnomAD exome database (non-Finnish European or global), identified a gene, SLC9A3R1, with statistically significant effect (odds ratio = 17.09 or 17.04; Bonferroni-corrected P-value &lt; 0.05). These findings in a small patient cohort did not identify a common gene/variant among most of these cases, as found in other disorders, for example small-fiber neuropathy. Further studies of these candidate genes/variants might enhance understanding of the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of corneal neuralgia."	"Association of small-fiber polyneuropathy with three previously unassociated rare missense SCN9A variants. Small fiber polyneuropathy (SFN) involves ectopic firing and degeneration of small-diameter, somatic/autonomic peripheral axons. Causes include diabetes, inflammation and rare pathogenic mutations, including in SCN9-11 genes that encode small fiber sodium channels. The aim of this study is to associate a new phenotype-immunotherapy-responsive SFN-with rare amino acid-substituting SCN9A variants and present potential explanations. A retrospective chart review of two Caucasians with skin biopsy confirmed SFN and rare SCN9A single nucleotide polymorphisms not previously reported in neuropathy. A 47-year-old with 4 years of disabling widespread neuropathic pain and exertional intolerance had nerve- and skin biopsy-confirmed SFN, with blood tests revealing only high-titer antinuclear antibodies and low complement C4 consistent with B cell dysimmunity. Six years of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy markedly improved sensory and autonomic symptoms and normalized his neurite density. After whole exome sequencing revealed a potentially pathogenic SCN9A-A3734G variant, sodium channel blockers were tried. Herpes zoster left a 32-year-old with disabling exertional intolerance (&quot;chronic fatigue syndrome&quot;), postural syncope and tachycardia, arm and leg paresthesias, reduced sweating, and distal hairloss. Screening revealed antinuclear and potassium channel autoantibodies, so prednisone and then IVIg were prescribed with great benefit. During 4 years of immunotherapy, his symptoms and function improved, and all abnormal biomarkers (autonomic testing and skin biopsies) normalized. Whole exome sequencing then revealed two nearby compound heterozygous SCN9A variants that were computer-predicted to be deleterious. These cases newly associate three novel amino acid-substituting SCN9A variants with immunotherapy-responsive neuropathy. Only larger studies can determine whether these are contributory or coincidental, but they associate new variants with moderate or high likelihood of pathogenicity with a new highly related phenotype. La polyneuropathie des petites fibres implique le déclenchement d’activité ectopique et la dégénérescence des axones périphériques somatiques et autonomes de petit diamètre. Ses causes comprennent le diabète, l’inflammation et de rares mutations pathogènes, notamment dans les gènes SCN9–11 qui codent les canaux sodiques des petites fibres. Associer un nouveau phénotype de polyneuropathie des petites fibres répondant à l’immunothérapie à des variantes rares de SCN9A substituant des acides aminés et présenter des explications possibles. Examen rétrospectif des dossiers de deux personnes de race blanche ayant subi une biopsie cutanée et présentant des polymorphismes mononucléotidiques de SCN9A rares qui n’avaient pas été signalés auparavant dans le cadre d’une neuropathie. Une homme de 47 ans souffrant depuis quatre ans de douleurs neuropathiques généralisées invalidantes et d’intolérance à l’effort a subi une biopsie des nerfs et de la peau qui a confirmé la polyneuropathie des petits fibres, les analyses sanguines ne révélant que des anticorps antinucléaires de haut niveau et un faible complément C4 correspondant à la dysimmunité des lymphocytes B. Six ans de traitement par immunoglobulines intraveineuses ont permis d’améliorer sensiblement les symptômes sensoriels et autonomes et de normaliser la densité de ses neurites. Après que le séquençage de l’exome entier ait révélé une variante de SCN9A-A3734G potentiellement pathogène, des inhibiteurs des canaux sodiques ont été essayee. Le zona a entrainé chez un homme de 32 ans une intolérance à l’effort invalidante (« syndrome de fatigue chronique »), une syncope posturale et une tachycardie, une paresthésie des bras et des jambes, une réduction de la transpiration et une perte de cheveux aux jambes. Le dépistage a révélé la présence d’auto-anticorps antinucléaires et de canaux potassiques, de sorte que la prednisone puis des immunoglobulines intraveineuses ont été prescrites, avec d’excellents résultats. Pendant quatre ans d’immunothérapie, ses symptômes et son fonctionnement se sont améliorés et tous les biomarqueurs anormaux (tests autonomes et biopsies cutanées) se sont normalisés. Le séquençage de l’exome entier a ensuite révélé deux variantes hétérozygotes de SCN9A composées à proximité et prédites par ordinateur comme étant délétères. Ces cas associent trois nouvelles variantes de SCN9A substituant des acides aminés à une neuropathie répondant à l’immunothérapie. Seules des études de plus grande envergure peuvent déterminer s’il s’agit de facteurs contributifs ou de coïncidences, mais ces cas associent de nouvelles variantes ayant une probabilité modérée ou élevée de pathogénicité à un nouveau phénotype étroitement apparenté."	"Conversion of Neural Stem Cells into Functional Neuron-Like Cells by MicroRNA-218: Differential Expression of Functionality Genes. Conversion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into neuron-like cells (NLC) is a feasible cell therapy strategy for replacing lost neurons in neuronal disorders. In this study, adipose-derived MSC (ADMSC) were converted into neural stem cells (NSC) via neurosphere. The resulting NSC were then differentiated into NLC by transduction with microRNA-218, using a lentiviral vector. ADMSC, NSC, and NLC were first characterized by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry. The functionality of the NLC was evaluated by qRT-PCR and patch clamp recording. Immunophenotyping of ADMSC showed their immunoreactivity to MSC markers CD90, CD73, CD105, and CD49d, but not to CD31 and CD45. RT-PCR results demonstrated the expression of nestin, neurogenin, neurod1, neurofilament light, and GAP43 genes in NSC while NLC expressed synaptophysin, neurofilament heavy, and GAP43. In addition, NSC morphology changed into multipolar with long processes after transduction with miR-218. Moreover, using qRT-PCR, the expression levels of miR-218 and functionality genes CACNA1C, SNAP25, KCNH1, KCNMA1, and SCN9A were significantly increased in NLC, compared with NSC, and ADMSC at 3 weeks and 5 months post-transduction. Furthermore, the generated NLC expressed significantly higher protein levels of neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NFh) and enolase 2 (Eno2) neuronal markers, compared with ADMSC and NSC. Finally, action potentials were successfully recorded by the generated NLC, using patch clamp. In summary, ADMSC-derived NSC differentiated into functional NLC by transduction with miR-218. The generated NLC expressed functional SNAP25, CACNA1C, KCNH1, KCNMA1, and SCN9A and produced an action potential, which provides useful insights into the generation of functional neuronal cells."	"Uncoupling sodium channel dimers rescues the phenotype of a pain-linked Nav1.7 mutation. The voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 is essential for adequate perception of painful stimuli. Mutations in the encoding gene, SCN9A, cause various pain syndromes in human patients. The hNav1.7/A1632E mutant causes symptoms of erythromelalgia and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), and its main gating change is a strongly enhanced persistent current. On the basis of recently published 3D structures of voltage-gated sodium channels, we investigated how the inactivation particle binds to the channel, how this mechanism is interfered with by the hNav1.7/A1632E mutation, and how dimerization modifies function of the pain-linked mutation. We applied atomistic molecular simulations to demonstrate the effect of the mutation on channel fast inactivation. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to demonstrate channel dimerization and patch-clamp measurements revealed a link between functional channel dimerization and the impairment of fast inactivation by the hNav1.7/A1632E mutation. We demonstrate that the enhanced persistent current of hNav1.7/A1632E is due to impaired binding of the inactivation particle, which inhibits the proper function of the recently proposed allosteric fast inactivation mechanism. We show that hNav1.7 forms dimers and that the disease-associated persistent current of hNav1.7/A1632E depends on the channel's functional dimerization status: Expression of the synthetic peptide difopein, a 14-3-3 inhibitor known to functionally uncouple dimers, significantly decreased hNav1.7/A1632E-induced persistent currents. Functional uncoupling of mutant hNav1.7/A1632E channel dimers rescues its defective allosteric fast inactivation mechanism. Our findings support the concept of sodium channel dimerization and reveal its potential relevance for human pain syndromes."	"The plasma peptides of sepsis. A practical strategy to discover sepsis specific proteins may be to compare the plasma peptides and proteins from patients in the intensive care unit with and without sepsis. The aim was to discover proteins and/or peptides that show greater observation frequency and/or precursor intensity in sepsis. The endogenous tryptic peptides of ICU-Sepsis were compared to ICU Control, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, female normal, sepsis, heart attack, Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis along with their institution-matched controls, female normals and normal samples collected directly onto ice. Endogenous tryptic peptides were extracted from individual sepsis and control EDTA plasma samples in a step gradient of acetonitrile for random and independent sampling by LC-ESI-MS/MS with a set of robust and sensitive linear quadrupole ion traps. The MS/MS spectra were fit to fully tryptic peptides within proteins using the X!TANDEM algorithm. The protein observation frequency was counted using the SEQUEST algorithm after selecting the single best charge state and peptide sequence for each MS/MS spectra. The protein observation frequency of ICU-sepsis versus ICU Control was subsequently tested by Chi square analysis. The average protein or peptide log10 precursor intensity was compared across disease and control treatments by ANOVA in the R statistical system. Peptides and/or phosphopeptides of common plasma proteins such as ITIH3, SAA2, SAA1, and FN1 showed increased observation frequency by Chi square (χ<sup>2</sup> &gt; 9, p &lt; 0.003) and/or precursor intensity in sepsis. Cellular gene symbols with large Chi square values from tryptic peptides included POTEB, CTNNA1, U2SURP, KIF24, NLGN2, KSR1, GTF2H1, KIT, RPS6KL1, VAV2, HSPA7, SMC2, TCEB3B, ZNF300, SUPV3L1, ADAMTS20, LAMB4, MCCC1, SUPT6H, SCN9A, SBNO1, EPHA1, ABLIM2, cB5E3.2, EPHA10, GRIN2B, HIVEP2, CCL16, TKT, LRP2 and TMF1 amongst others showed increased observation frequency. Similarly, increased frequency of tryptic phosphopeptides were observed from POM121C, SCN8A, TMED8, NSUN7, SLX4, MADD, DNLZ, PDE3B, UTY, DEPDC7, MTX1, MYO1E, RXRB, SYDE1, FN1, PUS7L, FYCO1, USP26, ACAP2, AHI1, KSR2, LMAN1, ZNF280D and SLC8A2 amongst others. Increases in mean precursor intensity in peptides from common plasma proteins such as ITIH3, SAA2, SAA1, and FN1 as well as cellular proteins such as COL24A1, POTEB, KANK1, SDCBP2, DNAH11, ADAMTS7, MLLT1, TTC21A, TSHR, SLX4, MTCH1, and PUS7L among others were associated with sepsis. The processing of SAA1 included the cleavage of the terminal peptide D/PNHFRPAGLPEKY from the most hydrophilic point of SAA1 on the COOH side of the cystatin C binding that was most apparent in ICU-Sepsis patients compared to all other diseases and controls. Additional cleavage of SAA1 on the NH2 terminus side of the cystatin binding site were observed in ICU-Sepsis. Thus there was disease associated variation in the processing of SAA1 in ICU-Sepsis versus ICU controls or other diseases and controls. Specific proteins and peptides that vary between diseases might be discovered by the random and independent sampling of multiple disease and control plasma from different hospital and clinics by LC-ESI-MS/MS for storage in a relational SQL Server database and analysis with the R statistical system that will be a powerful tool for clinical research. The processing of SAA1 may play an unappreciated role in the inflammatory response to Sepsis."
"GRIN2A"	"epilepsy"	"GRIN2A -Related Severe Epileptic Encephalopathy Treated with Memantine: An Example of Precision Medicine. Epileptic spasm (ES) is one of the seizure types which is difficult to treat. Next-generation sequencing has facilitated rapid gene discovery that is linked to ES and GRIN2A being one of them. Genotype-driven precision medicine is on the horizon and is a targeted treatment approach toward the precise molecular cause of the disease. GRIN2A gene encodes for a subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and it has been suggested from in vitro studies and few case reports that memantine, a NMDA receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce seizures in patients with GRIN2A mutations. Here, we describe a patient with a novel GRIN2A mutation and severe drug-resistant ES who became seizure free with memantine."	"Next Generation Sequencing of 134 Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Regression. Approximately 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience developmental regression, the etiology of which remains largely unknown. We performed a complete literature search and identified 47 genes that had been implicated in such cases. We sequenced these genes in a preselected cohort of 134 individuals with regressive autism. In total, 16 variants in 12 genes with evidence supportive of pathogenicity were identified. They were classified as variants of uncertain significance based on ACMG standards and guidelines. Among these were recurring variants in GRIN2A and PLXNB2, variants in genes that were linked to syndromic forms of ASD (GRIN2A, MECP2, CDKL5, SCN1A,PCDH19, UBE3A, and SLC9A6), and variants in the form of oligogenic heterozygosity (EHMT1, SLC9A6, and MFSD8)."	"Positive allosteric modulators that target NMDA receptors rectify loss-of-function GRIN variants associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) mediate a slow component of excitatory synaptic transmission that plays important roles in normal brain function and development. A large number of disease-associated variants in the GRIN gene family encoding NMDAR GluN subunits have been identified in patients with various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Many of these variants reduce the function of NMDARs by a range of different mechanisms, including reduced glutamate potency, reduced glycine potency, accelerated deactivation time course, decreased surface expression, and/or reduced open probability. We have evaluated whether three positive allosteric modulators of NMDAR receptor function (24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, pregnenolone sulfate, tobramycin) and three co-agonists (d-serine, l-serine, and d-cycloserine) can mitigate the diminished function of NMDARs harboring GRIN variants. We examined the effects of these modulators on NMDARs that contained 21 different loss-of-function variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A, or GRIN2B, identified in patients with epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and/or movement disorders. For all variants, some aspect of the reduced function was partially restored. Moreover, some variants showed enhanced sensitivity to positive allosteric modulators compared to wild type receptors. These results raise the possibility that enhancement of NMDAR function by positive allosteric modulators may be a useful therapeutic strategy."	"Brain transcriptome study through CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mouse Dip2c gene knock-out. Dip2C is highly expressed in brain and many other tissues but its biological functions are still not clear. Genes regulated by Dip2C in brain have never been studied. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems, adaptive immune systems of bacteria and archaea, have been recently developed and broadly used in genome editing. Here, we describe targeted gene deletions of Dip2c gene in mice via CRISPR/Cas9 system and study of brain transcriptome under Dip2C regulation. The CRISPR/Cas9 system effectively generated targeted deletions of Dip2c by pronuclei injection of plasmids that express Cas9 protein and two sgRNAs. We achieved targeted large fragment deletion with efficiencies at 14.3% (1/7), 66.7% (2/3) and 20% (1/5) respectively in 3 independent experiments, averaging 26.7%. The large deletion DNA segments are 160.4 kb (Dip2C<sup>Δ160kb</sup>), spanning from end of exon 4 to mid of exon 38. A mouse with two base pair deletion was generated from a single sgRNA targeting in exon 4 (Dip2c<sup>Δ2bp</sup>) by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Loss of gene expression for Dip2c mRNA was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Dip2C-regulated genes and pathways in brain were investigated through RNAseq of Dip2c<sup>Δ2bp</sup>. In total, 838 genes were found differentially regulated, with 252 up and 586 down. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that DEGs in brain are enriched in neurological functions including 'memory', 'neuropeptide signaling pathway', and 'response to amphetamine' while KEGG analysis shows that 'neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway' is the most significantly enriched. DEGs Grid2ip, Grin2a, Grin2c, Grm4, Gabbr2, Gabra5, Gabre, Gabrq, Gabra6 and Gabrr2 are among the highly regulated genes by Dip2C. Results confirm Dip2C may play important roles in brain development and function."	"The Utility of Speech-Language Biomarkers to Predict Oral Feeding Outcomes in the Premature Newborn. Purpose Successful oral feeding and speech emergence are dependent upon the coordination of shared oral muscles and facial nerves. We aimed to determine if the speech-associated genes, forkhead box P2 (FOXP2), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl D-aspartate 2A (GRIN2A), and neurexin 1, were detectable in neonatal saliva and could predict feeding outcomes in premature newborns. Method In this prospective, observational, preliminary study, saliva collected from 51 premature infants (gestational ages: 30-34 6/7 weeks) at different stages of oral feeding development underwent gene expression analysis. Binary (+/-) expression profiles were explored and examined in relation to days to achieve full oral feeds. Results GRIN2A and neurexin 1 rarely amplified in neonatal saliva and were not informative. Infants who amplified FOXP2 but not CNTNAP2 at the start of oral feeds achieved oral feeding success 3.20 (95% CI [-2.5, 8.9]) days sooner than other gene combinations. Conclusions FOXP2 and CNTNAP2 may be informative in predicting oral feeding outcomes in newborns. Salivary analysis at the start of oral feeding trials may inform feeding outcomes in this population and warrants further investigation."
"ANKRD11"	"autism"	"16q24.3 Microduplication in a Patient With Developmental Delay, Intellectual Disability, Short Stature, and Nonspecific Dysmorphic Features: Case Report and Review of the Literature. We describe the case of a seven-year-old female patient who presented in our service with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and femur fracture, observed in the context of very low bone mineral density. Array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP array) analysis identified a 113 kb duplication involving the morbid OMIM genes: ANKRD11 (exon1), RPL13, and PGN genes. ANKRD11 deletions are frequently described in association with KBG syndrome, the duplications being less frequent (one case described before). The exome sequencing was negative for pathogenic variants or of uncertain significance in genes possibly associated with this phenotype. The patient presented subtle signs of KBG syndrome. It is known that the phenotype of KBG syndrome has a wide clinical spectrum, this syndrome being often underdiagnosed due to overlapping features with other conditions, also characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual disability. The particularity of this case is represented by the very low bone mineral density in a patient with 16q24.3 duplication. ANKRD11 haploinsufficiency is known to be associated with skeletal involvement, such as short stature, or delayed bone age. An effect on bone density has been observed only in experimental studies on mice with induced missense mutations in the ANKRD11 gene. This CNV also involved the duplication of the very conserved RPL13 gene, which could have a role for the skeletal phenotype of this patient, knowing the high level of gene expression in bone tissue and also the association with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Isidor Toutain type, in case of splicing mutations."	"A Private 16q24.2q24.3 Microduplication in a Boy with Intellectual Disability, Speech Delay and Mild Dysmorphic Features. No data on interstitial microduplications of the 16q24.2q24.3 chromosome region are available in the medical literature and remain extraordinarily rare in public databases. Here, we describe a boy with a de novo 16q24.2q24.3 microduplication at the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)-array analysis spanning ~2.2 Mb and encompassing 38 genes. The patient showed mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, speech delay and mild dysmorphic features. In DECIPHER, we found six individuals carrying a &quot;pure&quot; overlapping microduplication. Although available data are very limited, genomic and phenotype comparison of our and previously annotated patients suggested a potential clinical relevance for 16q24.2q24.3 microduplication with a variable and not (yet) recognizable phenotype predominantly affecting cognition. Comparing the cytogenomic data of available individuals allowed us to delineate the smallest region of overlap involving 14 genes. Accordingly, we propose ANKRD11, CDH15, and CTU2 as candidate genes for explaining the related neurodevelopmental manifestations shared by these patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a clinical and molecular comparison among patients with overlapping 16q24.2q24.3 microduplication has been done. This study broadens our knowledge of the phenotypic consequences of 16q24.2q24.3 microduplication, providing supporting evidence of an emerging syndrome."	"Pathogenic variants in EP300 and ANKRD11 in patients with phenotypes overlapping Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), and KBG syndrome are three distinct developmental human disorders. Variants in seven genes belonging to the cohesin pathway, NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8, RAD21, ANKRD11, and BRD4, were identified in about 80% of patients with CdLS, suggesting that additional causative genes remain to be discovered. Two genes, CREBBP and EP300, have been associated with RSTS, whereas KBG results from variants in ANKRD11. By exome sequencing, a genetic cause was elucidated in two patients with clinical diagnosis of CdLS but without variants in known CdLS genes. In particular, genetic variants in EP300 and ANKRD11 were identified in the two patients with CdLS. EP300 and ANKRD11 pathogenic variants caused the reduction of the respective proteins suggesting that their low levels contribute to CdLS-like phenotype. These findings highlight the clinical overlap between CdLS, RSTS, and KBG and support the notion that these rare disorders are linked to abnormal chromatin remodeling, which in turn affects the transcriptional machinery."	"Growth hormone therapy for children with KBG syndrome: A case report and review of literature. The incidence of short stature in KBG syndrome is relatively high. Data on the therapeutic effects of growth hormone (GH) on children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature in the previous literature has not been summarized. Here we studied a girl with KBG syndrome and collected the data of children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature from previous studies before and after GH therapy. The girl was referred to our department because of short stature. Physical examination revealed mild dysmorphic features. The peak GH responses to arginine and clonidine were 6.22 and 5.40 ng/mL, respectively. The level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was 42.0 ng/mL. Genetic analysis showed a c.2635 dupG (p.Glu879fs) mutation in the ANKRD11 gene. She received GH therapy. During the first year of GH therapy, her height increased by 0.92 standard deviation score (SDS). Her height increased from -1.95 SDS to -0.70 SDS after two years of GH therapy. There were ten children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature who received GH therapy in reported cases. Height SDS was improved in nine (9/10) of them. The mean height SDS in five children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature increased from -2.72 ± 0.44 to -1.95 ± 0.57 after the first year of GH therapy (P = 0.001). There were no adverse reactions reported after GH treatment. GH treatment is effective in our girl and most children with KBG syndrome accompanied by short stature during the first year of therapy."	"KBG syndrome in two patients from Egypt. KBG syndrome is an intellectual disability (ID) associated with multiple congenital anomalies in which the macrodontia could be the clue for the diagnosis. It is caused either by heterozygous variant in ANKRD11 gene or 16q24.3 microdeletions that involve the ANKRD11 gene. Here, we report on two unrelated male patients who presented with ID, short stature, webbing of neck, and cryptorchidism. Noonan syndrome was suspected first but the presence of macrodontia in both patients pointed to KBG syndrome which was confirmed thereafter by the identification of a novel pathogenic variant in ANKRD11 gene, c.5488G&gt;T (p.E1830*). Macrodontia was noticed in all the deciduous anterior teeth in Patient 1. This observation was reported previously in few patients, but it seems to be a common feature that could be misdiagnosed as premature eruption of teeth. Therefore, our results confirm that maxillary permanent central incisors may not be the only teeth affected in KBG but also all the deciduous teeth. Interestingly, desquamative gingivitis was additionally noted in Patient 1, which has not been reported previously, however; it could be a coincidental finding.

Dysfunction of the Hippo pathway enables cells to evade contact inhibition and provides advantages for cancerous overgrowth. However, for a significant portion of human cancer, how Hippo signaling is perturbed remains unknown. To answer this question, we performed a genome-wide screening for genes that affect the Hippo pathway in Drosophila and cross-referenced the hit genes with human cancer genome. In our screen, Prosap was identified as a novel regulator of the Hippo pathway that potently affects tissue growth. Interestingly, a mammalian homolog of Prosap, SHANK2, is the most frequently amplified gene on 11q13, a major tumor amplicon in human cancer. Gene amplification profile in this 11q13 amplicon clearly indicates selective pressure for SHANK2 amplification. More importantly, across the human cancer genome, SHANK2 is the most frequently amplified gene that is not located within the Myc amplicon. Further studies in multiple human cell lines confirmed that SHANK2 overexpression causes deregulation of Hippo signaling through competitive binding for a LATS1 activator, and as a potential oncogene, SHANK2 promotes cellular transformation and tumor formation in vivo. In cancer cell lines with deregulated Hippo pathway, depletion of SHANK2 restores Hippo signaling and ceases cellular proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that SHANK2 is an evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway regulator, commonly amplified in human cancer and potently promotes cancer. Our study for the first time illustrated oncogenic function of SHANK2, one of the most frequently amplified gene in human cancer. Furthermore, given that in normal adult tissues, SHANK2's expression is largely restricted to the nervous system, SHANK2 may represent an interesting target for anticancer therapy."	"Distinct Mechanisms of Over-Representation of Landmarks and Rewards in the Hippocampus. In the hippocampus, locations associated with salient features are represented by a disproportionately large number of neurons, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this over-representation remain elusive. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in mice learning to navigate in virtual reality, we find that the over-representation of reward and landmark locations are mediated by persistent and separable subsets of neurons, with distinct time courses of emergence and differing underlying molecular mechanisms. Strikingly, we find that in mice lacking Shank2, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked gene encoding an excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein, the learning-induced over-representation of landmarks was absent whereas the over-representation of rewards was substantially increased, as was goal-directed behavior. These findings demonstrate that multiple hippocampal coding processes for unique types of salient features are distinguished by a Shank2-dependent mechanism and suggest that abnormally distorted hippocampal salience mapping may underlie cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in a subset of ASDs."	"meQTL and ncRNA functional analyses of 102 GWAS-SNPs associated with depression implicate HACE1 and SHANK2 genes. Little is known about how genetics and epigenetics interplay in depression. Evidence suggests that genetic variants may change vulnerability to depression by modulating DNA methylation (DNAm) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) levels. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the genetic variation, previously identified in the largest genome-wide association study for depression, on proximal DNAm and ncRNA levels. We performed DNAm quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis in two independent cohorts (total n = 435 healthy individuals), testing associations between 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNAm levels in whole blood. We identified and replicated 64 SNP-CpG pairs (padj. &lt; 0.05) with meQTL effect. Lower DNAm at cg02098413 located in the HACE1 promoter conferred by the risk allele (C allele) at rs1933802 was associated with higher risk for depression (praw = 0.014, DNAm = 2.3%). In 1202 CD14+ cells sorted from blood, DNAm at cg02088412 positively correlated with HACE1 mRNA expression. Investigation in postmortem brain tissue of adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) indicated 1% higher DNAm at cg02098413 in neurons and lower HACE1 mRNA expression in CA1 hippocampus of MDD patients compared with healthy controls (p = 0.008 and 0.012, respectively). Expression QTL analysis in blood of 74 adolescent revealed that hsa-miR-3664-5p was associated with rs7117514 (SHANK2) (padj. = 0.015, mRNA difference = 5.2%). Gene ontology analysis of the miRNA target genes highlighted implication in neuronal processes. Collectively, our findings from a multi-tissue (blood and brain) and multi-layered (genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic) approach suggest that genetic factors may influence depression by modulating DNAm and miRNA levels. Alterations at HACE1 and SHANK2 loci imply potential mechanisms, such as oxidative stress in the brain, underlying depression. Our results deepened the knowledge of molecular mechanisms in depression and suggest new epigenetic targets that should be further evaluated."	"New insights into the associations among feed efficiency, metabolizable efficiency traits and related QTL regions in broiler chickens. Improving the feed efficiency would increase profitability for producers while also reducing the environmental footprint of livestock production. This study was conducted to investigate the relationships among feed efficiency traits and metabolizable efficiency traits in 180 male broilers. Significant loci and genes affecting the metabolizable efficiency traits were explored with an imputation-based genome-wide association study. The traits measured or calculated comprised three growth traits, five feed efficiency related traits, and nine metabolizable efficiency traits. The residual feed intake (RFI) showed moderate to high and positive phenotypic correlations with eight other traits measured, including average daily feed intake (ADFI), dry excreta weight (DEW), gross energy excretion (GEE), crude protein excretion (CPE), metabolizable dry matter (MDM), nitrogen corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn), abdominal fat weight (AbF), and percentage of abdominal fat (AbP). Greater correlations were observed between growth traits and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) than RFI. In addition, the RFI, FCR, ADFI, DEW, GEE, CPE, MDM, AMEn, AbF, and AbP were lower in low-RFI birds than high-RFI birds (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05), whereas the coefficients of MDM and MCP of low-RFI birds were greater than those of high-RFI birds (P &lt; 0.01). Five narrow QTLs for metabolizable efficiency traits were detected, including one 82.46-kb region for DEW and GEE on Gallus gallus chromosome (GGA) 26, one 120.13-kb region for MDM and AMEn on GGA1, one 691.25-kb region for the coefficients of MDM and AMEn on GGA5, one region for the coefficients of MDM and MCP on GGA2 (103.45-103.53 Mb), and one 690.50-kb region for the coefficient of MCP on GGA14. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis indicated that the five regions contained high LD blocks, as well as the genes chromosome 26 C6orf106 homolog (C26H6orf106), LOC396098, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (SHANK2), ETS homologous factor (EHF), and histamine receptor H3-like (HRH3L), which are known to be involved in the regulation of neurodevelopment, cell proliferation and differentiation, and food intake. Selection for low RFI significantly decreased chicken feed intake, excreta output, and abdominal fat deposition, and increased nutrient digestibility without changing the weight gain. Five novel QTL regions involved in the control of metabolizable efficiency in chickens were identified. These results, combined through nutritional and genetic approaches, should facilitate novel insights into improving feed efficiency in poultry and other species."	"Insulin-like growth factor 1 partially rescues early developmental defects caused by SHANK2 knockdown in human neurons. SHANK2 is a scaffold protein that serves as a protein anchor at the postsynaptic density in neurons. Genetic variants of SHANK2 are strongly associated with synaptic dysfunction and the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder. Recent studies indicate that early neuronal developmental defects play a role in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder, and that insulin-like growth factor 1 has a positive effect on neurite development. To investigate the effects of SHANK2 knockdown on early neuronal development, we generated a sparse culture system using human induced pluripotent stem cells, which then differentiated into neural progenitor cells after 3-14 days in culture, and which were dissociated into single neurons. Neurons in the experimental group were infected with shSHANK2 lentivirus carrying a red fluorescent protein reporter (shSHANK2 group). Control neurons were infected with scrambled shControl lentivirus carrying a red fluorescent protein reporter (shControl group). Neuronal somata and neurites were reconstructed based on the lentiviral red fluorescent protein signal. Developmental dendritic and motility changes in VGLUT1<sup>+</sup> glutamatergic neurons and TH<sup>+</sup> dopaminergic neurons were then evaluated in both groups. Compared with shControl VGLUT1<sup>+</sup> neurons, the dendritic length and arborizations of shSHANK2 VGLUT1<sup>+</sup> neurons were shorter and fewer, while cell soma speed was higher. Furthermore, dendritic length and arborization were significantly increased after insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment of shSHANK2 neurons, while cell soma speed remained unaffected. These results suggest that insulin-like growth factor 1 can rescue morphological defects, but not the change in neuronal motility. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SHANK2 deficiency perturbs early neuronal development, and that IGF1 can partially rescue the neuronal defects caused by SHANK2 knockdown. All experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Jinan University, China (approval No. 20170228010) on February 28, 2017."
"POGZ"	"autism"	"Evolution of pogo, a separate superfamily of IS630-Tc1-mariner transposons, revealing recurrent domestication events in vertebrates. Tc1/mariner and Zator, as two superfamilies of IS630-Tc1-mariner (ITm) group, have been well-defined. However, the molecular evolution and domestication of pogo transposons, once designated as an important family of the Tc1/mariner superfamily, are still poorly understood. Here, phylogenetic analysis show that pogo transposases, together with Tc1/mariner, DD34E/Gambol, and Zator transposases form four distinct monophyletic clades with high bootstrap supports (&gt; = 74%), suggesting that they are separate superfamilies of ITm group. The pogo superfamily represents high diversity with six distinct families (Passer, Tigger, pogoR, Lemi, Mover, and Fot/Fot-like) and wide distribution with an expansion spanning across all the kingdoms of eukaryotes. It shows widespread occurrences in animals and fungi, but restricted taxonomic distribution in land plants. It has invaded almost all lineages of animals-even mammals-and has been domesticated repeatedly in vertebrates, with 12 genes, including centromere-associated protein B (CENPB), CENPB DNA-binding domain containing 1 (CENPBD1), Jrk helix-turn-helix protein (JRK), JRK like (JRKL), pogo transposable element derived with KRAB domain (POGK), and with ZNF domain (POGZ), and Tigger transposable element-derived 2 to 7 (TIGD2-7), deduced as originating from this superfamily. Two of them (JRKL and TIGD2) seem to have been co-domesticated, and the others represent independent domestication events. Four genes (TIGD3, TIGD4, TIGD5, and POGZ) tend to represent ancient domestications in vertebrates, while the others only emerge in mammals and seem to be domesticated recently. Significant structural variations including target site duplication (TSD) types and the DDE triad signatures (DD29-56D) were observed for pogo transposons. Most domesticated genes are derived from the complete transposase genes; but CENPB, POGK, and POGZ are chimeric genes fused with additional functional domains. This is the first report to systematically reveal the evolutionary profiles of the pogo transposons, suggesting that pogo and Tc1/Mariner are two separate superfamilies of ITm group, and demonstrating the repeated domestications of pogo in vertebrates. These data indicate that pogo transposons have played important roles in shaping the genome and gene evolution of fungi and animals. This study expands our understanding of the diversity of pogo transposons and updates the classification of ITm group."	"A novel patient with White-Sutton syndrome refines the mutational and clinical repertoire of the POGZ-related phenotype and suggests further observations. A rare developmental delay (DD)/intellectual disability (ID) syndrome with craniofacial dysmorphisms and autistic features, termed White-Sutton syndrome (WHSUS, MIM#614787), has been recently described, identifying truncating mutations in the chromatin regulator POGZ (KIAA0461, MIM#614787). We describe a further WHSUS patient harboring a novel nonsense de novo POGZ variant, which afflicts a protein domain with transposase activity less frequently impacted by mutational events (DDE domain). This patient displays additional physical and behavioral features, these latter mimicking Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS, MIM#182290). Considering sleep-wake cycle anomalies and abnormal behavior manifested by this boy, we reinforced the clinical resemblance between WHSUS and SMS, being both chromatinopathies. In addition, using the DeepGestalt technology, we identified a different facial overlap between WHSUS patients with mutations in the DDE domain (Group 1) and individuals harboring variants in other protein domains/regions (Group 2). This report further delineates the clinical and molecular repertoire of the POGZ-related phenotype, adding a novel patient with uncommon clinical and behavioral features and provides the first computer-aided facial study of WHSUS patients."	"Severe childhood speech disorder: Gene discovery highlights transcriptional dysregulation. Determining the genetic basis of speech disorders provides insight into the neurobiology of human communication. Despite intensive investigation over the past 2 decades, the etiology of most speech disorders in children remains unexplained. To test the hypothesis that speech disorders have a genetic etiology, we performed genetic analysis of children with severe speech disorder, specifically childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). Precise phenotyping together with research genome or exome analysis were performed on children referred with a primary diagnosis of CAS. Gene coexpression and gene set enrichment analyses were conducted on high-confidence gene candidates. Thirty-four probands ascertained for CAS were studied. In 11/34 (32%) probands, we identified highly plausible pathogenic single nucleotide (n = 10; CDK13, EBF3, GNAO1, GNB1, DDX3X, MEIS2, POGZ, SETBP1, UPF2, ZNF142) or copy number (n = 1; 5q14.3q21.1 locus) variants in novel genes or loci for CAS. Testing of parental DNA was available for 9 probands and confirmed that the variants had arisen de novo. Eight genes encode proteins critical for regulation of gene transcription, and analyses of transcriptomic data found CAS-implicated genes were highly coexpressed in the developing human brain. We identify the likely genetic etiology in 11 patients with CAS and implicate 9 genes for the first time. We find that CAS is often a sporadic monogenic disorder, and highly genetically heterogeneous. Highly penetrant variants implicate shared pathways in broad transcriptional regulation, highlighting the key role of transcriptional regulation in normal speech development. CAS is a distinctive, socially debilitating clinical disorder, and understanding its molecular basis is the first step towards identifying precision medicine approaches."	"Pathogenic POGZ mutation causes impaired cortical development and reversible autism-like phenotypes. Pogo transposable element derived with ZNF domain (POGZ) has been identified as one of the most recurrently de novo mutated genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and White-Sutton syndrome; however, the neurobiological basis behind these disorders remains unknown. Here, we show that POGZ regulates neuronal development and that ASD-related de novo mutations impair neuronal development in the developing mouse brain and induced pluripotent cell lines from an ASD patient. We also develop the first mouse model heterozygous for a de novo POGZ mutation identified in a patient with ASD, and we identify ASD-like abnormalities in the mice. Importantly, social deficits can be treated by compensatory inhibition of elevated cell excitability in the mice. Our results provide insight into how de novo mutations on high-confidence ASD genes lead to impaired mature cortical network function, which underlies the cellular pathogenesis of NDDs, including ASD."	"The Cardiac Genome Clinic: implementing genome sequencing in pediatric heart disease. This study investigated the diagnostic utility of nontargeted genomic testing in patients with pediatric heart disease. We analyzed genome sequencing data of 111 families with cardiac lesions for rare, disease-associated variation. In 14 families (12.6%), we identified causative variants: seven were de novo (ANKRD11, KMT2D, NR2F2, POGZ, PTPN11, PURA, SALL1) and six were inherited from parents with no or subclinical heart phenotypes (FLT4, DNAH9, MYH11, NEXMIF, NIPBL, PTPN11). Outcome of the testing was associated with the presence of extracardiac features (p = 0.02), but not a positive family history for cardiac lesions (p = 0.67). We also report novel plausible gene-disease associations for tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary stenosis (CDC42BPA, FGD5), hypoplastic left or right heart (SMARCC1, TLN2, TRPM4, VASP), congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (UBXN10), and early-onset cardiomyopathy (TPCN1). The identified candidate genes have critical functions in heart development, such as angiogenesis, mechanotransduction, regulation of heart size, chromatin remodeling, or ciliogenesis. This data set demonstrates the diagnostic and scientific value of genome sequencing in pediatric heart disease, anticipating its role as a first-tier diagnostic test. The genetic heterogeneity will necessitate large-scale genomic initiatives for delineating novel gene-disease associations."
